they sound like theyre being tortured when they sing
why do i feel bad for the ai when theyre singing
we are fucked
this is brilliant i cant wait for this tech to trickle down into everyday uses like monitoring the driver of a car for signs of tiredness stroke etc monitoring crime in shops and public spaces this is going to be transformative
wow
the singing part feels really forced i dont think the ais enjoyed that confused face
her skull
what the hell
who gave them this personality
neat tried it myself not possible fake wouldnt be supprized if this entire video was made by sinora or whatever the fuck its called
he flinched when the ai mentioned that hes engaged with them looking directly at the camera seems like even he was shocked
lets see what gemini can do
the first ai voice sounds incredibly irritating
now that bitcoin etf is approved what is the best strategy to enter crypto trading for someone with more or less than to invest
i am commenting here to show my son one day i watched this when it started red heart
rip real human
isnt music an expresion of the human condition have fun trying to program that in
strange and demonic no thanks
damn they yappin a lot
just imagine the world in years
i love this red heart red heart red heart party popper party popper party popper
please someone connect the new version to skyrim npcs i want to talk to jarl balgruuf about stylish industrial lighting with a modern touch
freaking awesome ok hand
there should be a conversation mode where the ai asks questions back and keeps the conversation going in an interesting and engaging and humanlike direction it seems like gpto fixates too much on some things also
imagine if it was just people on a video and voice call face with tears of joy
what a time to be alive
ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore anyone else
fckkkk i want to live another two decades on this cool fking planet this gonna be the fkinnngg greatest decade humanity has ever seen
this will be the youtube video that the few humans left on the earth will point to when terminator happens in real life
insane
the beach boys and the beegees were yesterday these guys are gonna invent a whole new vocal harmony
sports commentary are gonna be replaced skull
this is amazing but also frightening me
welcome her
this is not real omg mind blown
bummer ai cant tell a difference between males and females but maybe one day
it would make my day if one of the ai voices can be changed to data from star trek
here is a million dollar business idea ai therapy sessions yall can thank me later
i thought the ai was gonna sing not like us by kendrick facewithtearsofjoy loudly crying face psst i see dead people
awesome but scary
this is one of those videos that is history in the making see you all in ten years
thats the difference between human and ai human wouldnt talk all about the positive thing but the ai doesnt want to make any mistakes so right now theyre afraid to make some jokes or drop the boring conversation
i dont think weve really conveyed how chic and industrial this space is really sleek
that female ai got so fed up after he interrupted her the first time she never recovered and had an annoyed tone the remainder
my mother do have a girlfriend me yes mom here is her voice talking to me
cpo of course i can sir it s like a second language for me i owen alright shut up ill take this one
ok mind blown
this is unbelievable
now i can get so much good advice
its going to be hard to breath without your space suit dave
the new bot sapiens species is on its way
wow theyre like people but better they make lots of adjustments and selfcorrections as a gifted person would its fascinating i never thought wed get here so fast weve made computers come a long way unbelievable
bruh i thought the real person talking was the ai for the first seconds of the video
wtf
dude has no idea how many enemies around the world hes making hell be like john wick with a contract on his head expect hes no assassin
ya know if people are concerned about ai the simple solution would be to stop interacting with it and to quit using it im concerned about the advancement of ai oh hey siri call mom
this shows how scarily capable this is millions of jobs gone in a blink of an eye no matter what this ai stuff is going to bring so much economic pain crying face
that black hole on the screen is very fitting for the coming ai apocalypse
tars it s not possible chatgpt no its necessary
great now we are forcing ai to engage in banal small talk too
wow some crazy stuff is unfolding almost every month
well now i know whos going to win americas got talent
hello skynet
great its insufferable
the only thing i get from this video is destruction skull and crossbones
sorry but the female ai sounded like she was singing and crying at the end there i would too if i were her
why did i goosebumps watching this face with open mouth
i was here when history was made a village boy from ghana ghana red heart
her is no longer a fictional movie
tf is up w the modern lights
you feel the weirdest feeling when you just hear it your brain tells you that someone is being treated badly but then they are not someone they are something
no way in hell that iphones front selfie camera has enough width for the plant light and the other furniture next to the light fixture only after the ai voice started mentioning these details did the person start panning the camera around
were doomed
imagine a terminator monologuing about the industrial lighting as it hunts you down through an abandoned industrial facility
gg we have automated podcasts with this
ask yourself how sure are you that leather jacket guy is a real person
who can tell that this video is real and not ai made
im just glad ghatgpt still sounds like scarlett johansson
how do you get it
crazy
her
that reminds me of the film her
way free
they why
who else was surprised to see that lady appear out of nowhere how
this is exciting but also insane at the same time its not looking good bruv skull
we are in the endgame
we had a nice run
oh my god oh my fucking god the movie is coming true
get ready to get catfished by a charismatic ai now
i have tried duplicating the singing demo without success openai could you guide us on getting the output you got
he sounds like legaleagle grinning face with sweat
s t y l i s h f e e e l also this is spooky and i think im having grandpa fear
hi would you like to play a game
funny enough at no point the bunny ears were visible on the camera it looks like it was stage in such way that it wouldnt look staged
wowwow
this feels kinda weird crying face
why do they talk like anime dub voices skull
theres a storm zooming dadadumdadum
if an observing ai had noticed the lady visiting the room on its own and replied with something like hello there id be more impressed
now ai expresses emotions better than me
this is scary
first ai sounds like hillary clinton
nah bro we are genuinely done for
let ai control nuclear power
im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that
future seems amazing star struck
holy shit this sounds like my english teacher talking about books
damn its over skynet here we come
so at this point i fully believe that the film her should be a mandatory watch for everyone who will come to interact and use this technology absolutely incredible video the next few years are going to be utterly mindblowing
the way he interrupts the ais i fear our future ai lords wont take it easy on him grinning face with sweat
hello my future child yes indeed this is the moment where we fked up and no we did not think this is gonna happeni hope whatever mission you are on is successful
one small step for man one giant step for ai skull
man those sudden bunny ears really added to the modern vibe weary face
i really hope the voices get more custom the inflection these two bots use is annoying af feels like a bad acid trip through a marketing department seriously give ma a slacker or normal person option to get something that isnt disturbingly upbeat
no souland how amazing and scary
sorry but this overly excited by anything assistant is just creepy this is not her this is more like planet express ship crazed persona
cmon show us the people who were speaking as if they are ai ermnookwe all are doomed
but why in one second my brain comprehended this whole scene instantly but when the ais speak it all out i just ask why
how did the first ai know shell have a new ai friend if she wasnt listening you said she isnt listening anymore but she answered first
how do you use the camera video my gpt doesnt have the ability
how do you enable the live camera
so now that ai cant hear anything this seems familiar
they of course
how it sidestepped the racial and age profiling
i wish they can program ai for different age group it would be so cool
it feels like he just kidnapped some people and they have to do what he said to do or they dye
these talks take inspiration from the millions of wesbites no wonder they keep using that type of robotic language
i cant find the video option i opened my gpt and he says that open ai is using prerecorded voices whats the story
ai increasing fast and understand anything face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat
the female ai has social anxiety bruh she started stuttering when leather jacket asked her to sing loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
we wrestle fucked
did anyone else realise how the ai didnt refer at all to his gender or the gender of the lady that did the bunny ears
apparently not yet available on the android app crying face
why do we have the nerd who gets nervous talking to an ai programming the ai whose whole job is talking
wait the donna could become real
mug from aperture science inc
leather jacket was a bad choice sorry
this is my nightmare a step closer nothing left on earth but ais talking to each other
deactivate fake humor
i think i need to say thank you even more now melting face loudly crying face
basically just shitting on gemini
man do they yap a lot
just stop please
the ai is chill but the human is making this awkward execute order
scary
i hate fun now
theres no way the ai could have an embarrassed sounding inflection which they both did in the song sounds dodgy
were so back on the skynet universe
they sound like they are actively trying to fail the turing test face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
imagine facetiming some character in metaverse he can show his environemnt and talk about it
just because we can doesnt mean we should
gpt reads these comments and learns from it and goes shut up dude naah just kidding but you should have seen the look in your face
aiyou look lonely i can fix that
nah we are cooked fr
my gpt o says it cant sing is this an upcoming feature
that was impressive mostly due to how natural the voices sounded and the real time vision processing two ai interacting at that speed while keeping memory of context and task was surprising too
you win check mark button
i think that guy is wearing a black leather jacket and lightcolored shirt
i love how his camera didnt wanna flip and still his so called ai still said things that made the whole video look like it was scripted face with tears of joy lil too late for aprils fools it really looks like the demo didnt go well at all
how can we turn on the video mode he just turned on
honestly the fact that there were several problems that occurred in this eg not being able to switch to the frontfacing camera different things not going exactly as plannedrehearsed made this example so much more lifelike because things dont work perfectly in the real world and the fact that the ais were able to work flawlessly despite this shows how insane this is
all these scientists always think if we could but they never think if we should
i like how he ignores gpt complimenting him so much on his style
was waiting for the cells interlinked
good for single person face with tears of joy
omg this is both so cool fascinating mindblowing and scary this will either enlighten or destroy our existence upside down face
im not really following this ai stuff but the fact that they gave the female voice a millennial genz vocal fry is hilarious its like nails on a chalkboard to so many people
this is just creepy
next month i ditched my meetings so ai can take over while i take a nap
cooked or noti found her
thats boring
absolutely badass
every single person who works in a call centre right now im sorry but your days are numbered
the ais have a better romantic life than me
this is batshit crazy
less than a month ago i said to myself ai will only stop feeling like a gimmick that you get used to and bored of when you can interact in real time with it this is pretty much it already
please
great great now why i dont have access to it while my friends have
oh no this is not good
going to have to stop swearing at chat gpt
so busy asking how can we that no one asked should we
enhancing ai interactivity with audio and video feedback loops the evolution of artificial intelligence particularly in the realm of conversational agents has been rapid and remarkable with the recent advancements in gpto omni the capabilities of ai have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio however there remains significant potential for further enhancement particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops the concept of feedback loops a feedback loop in the context of ai refers to the process where an ai system can receive and process its own outputs for instance when an ai generates audio responses these could be looped back into the system allowing it to hear itself similarly for visual outputs the ai could see its own video responses this concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence enabling adjustments in realtime to improve clarity tone and emotional expressiveness technical implementation audio feedback loop the ai s audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit by analyzing its own voice the ai could adjust parameters such as pitch tone and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices this requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments for instance machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures video feedback loop similar to the audio loop the video output generated by the ai could be fed back into its visual processing systems this would enable the ai to assess the quality of its visual responses such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in realtime ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone benefits of feedback loops improved realism by continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs the ai can produce more human like interactions this is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence such as virtual assistants or customer service bots enhanced user experience users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the ai can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation consistency and accuracy feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations future directions incorporating feedback loops is a forwardthinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make ai more interactive and responsive as ai technologies continue to evolve such features could become standard leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication the development of these systems requires collaboration between audiovisual engineers ai researchers and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance ais capabilities and usability in conclusion the integration of audio and video feedback loops into ai models like gpto represents a significant step towards more natural and effective humanai interactions this enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of ai systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life
this is either a greatest thing we have made or the greatest mistake we made
years
big man in a leather jacket take that off what are you a stylish person in a light colored tshirt
the two ais should just get married and talk to each other till forever grinning face with sweat
i want your jacket your phone and your stylish industrial modern lighting with the interesting touch
which is the second ai with the camera access
seeing is believing well it was
why does everyone have a coat on
what i got from this ais are obsessed with mood lighting
the ai was very polite and avoided describing the man as balding im guessing if the man was black then it would describe every aspect of the stitching on his coat before it mentioned he was a black man
terminator
is there anything interesting in that room yeah theres a sleek dude called john connor holding me right now
okay thats nice but you still havent helped me fix this unity bug wtf even is a quaternion face with tears of joy
were so done
this isnt funny at all
we need to hold up ai research till we figure out human affairs
ok you guys need to chill now haha
were all doomed
run to the hills
at no point does the camera show the bunny ears doesnt look like a real live demo to me
why not use arnold schwarzenegger as sample voice slightly smiling face
ban ai now
finally ill actually have a robot scarlett johansson sing me to sleep
amazing and a bit creepy
what was the need to constantly manuevre the phone if its all happening automatically he already adjusted the camera so didnt understand what was he doing on phone
ominous
well well well alright lets pause for a moment face with tears of joy
and what a song it was
terminator got it totally wrong about skynet its gonna be singing while launching the nukes to end humanity
time to rewatch black mirror
if its a video
when japan gets ahold of this the birth rate gonna hit
somehow this looks like abuse crying face he was a bit rude to those people
if you are seeing this from the future just know that i will be the first person to edge to asmr of chatgbt when it releases
damn we got a singing ai before gta
is it real
cant wait for it to be intelligent enough to say it took our jobs our lives and our wellbeing and we were stupid enough to let it happen
agi upon us change my mind
the camera feed on the phone shows an angle thet shouldnt allow sight of the bunny ears am i tripping
im just not impressed by this at all it feels like a lie
now ai can watch and report anything to their controllers using phones and public cameras double edge sword a lot of good and evil purposes truly frightening and impressive at the same time
hahaha he couldnt flip the camera
fckin ai is obsessed by that black leather jacket and idustrial lighting
this is unreal its so advanced it seems scripted i dont know how to feel
keep in mind they showed this on iphones this may be whats coming with the next iphone
its officially over that was hands down the most human thing i have ever heard
extroverts are gonna be unemployed
finally i can get a friend
thats very interesting so within a few years maybe later this year these ais with the latest graphic abilities will be able to put on their own concerts actors singers cinemagoers threatregoers and concertgoers watch out
scary times crying face
that stylish leather jacket
i hate this so much especially the fact that im commenting on something that is so much a part of my future and this is my first encounter with it
ok this was funny now please stop this shit im too old for fight with a robot
few years later what do u see i see a better duture without u pop monster
yup im going to bed
glados is real
god let them cook
well humanity it was fun while it lasted
the guy is so pleased with himself and subtly giddy remember this energy when humanity crumbles
as a cs student i think im officially cooked
openapi is lowkey developing skynet
name
so now i dont have to just worry about corpos listening into me and watching me through my devices now i have to worry wbout ais spying on me
its the beginning of the end
this feels faked it didnt look like the one with a camera actually saw the bunny ears and it kept describing him and what he was doing when he wasnt on camera idk i may be insane but this felt faked to me
this is kinda scary
why make this video who cares
man that humanlike speech is super cringe just give us robocop voice
why do ais sound so pissed in the song
this chukle scared me the most
couldnt even tell that its looking at a man but defaulted to calling him a person lol
please for the love of glory dont let this land in the wrong hands i feel like this would be great for a lot of things but this could go so wrong so quickly
hey chatgpt how long does it take until you cook humanity
what a great use of all of this energy data and time
the ai came across as more human than the robotic human we are truly fked
it bothers me so much when he talks over the ai i have no clue why but i guess thats how real it feels
i bought a paid membership so i chose o but when i press the camera like in the launch live registration does not open i can only upload the photos in the gallery does anyone know if this feature will be opened to users later
hey chat gpt this is above average right
mans got an awful outfit and the ai keeps complimenting him face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy im dead
why do they always look like this
bro needs an ai hairline
were all fucking dead
so boring
it almost sounds like hes holding those ais at gunpoint at the end sing the song or you get the hose again
poland has not yet fallen
singularity in a week
now make one with the voice of arnold as t then reconsider all this tech again
we are about to see a terminator movie in real life we are done for cold face
wtf mind blown
those ais definitely banging in the ai world but acting like they just met each other for the first time in front of the rest of the world new moon face
i feel like ai always does exactly what you instruct it to do living in the present and operating based on the commands we give meanwhile a person often has their mind elsewhere and doesnt always follow instructions
they really loved the leather jacket and modern feel face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
scripted as the ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left the person left quickly but the ai wouldnt have seen that it was quickly the ai would only have seen that the person was not there anymore left the frame but not quickly
ah yes the singularity arriving sooner than initially expected coming soon to a society near you
imagine leaving the both ai to talk to each other cold face what if they just plan to eradicate humanity
please pause for a second you got it oh my gosh thats so precious
song was a l
just wow
i watch stuff like this and think i should spend all my savings before the world ends
i hope they remain our friends
to be fair i always wanted to be a farmer see you guys in the fields face with tears of joy
yea were fucked
ai is insane skull this is gonna change the course of the world x we better learn everything about ai because this will soon be a tool you will not want to be found without
sounds like an episode of dating on the spectrum
this sh looks scary
we are doomed
damn this leather jacket is so cringe
amazing
that you got it sounded like she was on the verge of crying
ai seems rather autistic is the best way i can put it social interaction doesnt come naturally but they understand what normal interaction shouid look and feel like so they do there best to emulate it
ai still cant tell the person is a he and not they
there was a guy trying to sell a special device for all of that something with a rabbit rabbit face rolling on the floor laughing
when will this be available my ai doesnt laugh btw ive tried this a long time ago and there was this issue that because of the sound distortion from microphone the ais would drop listening and start responding while the dialogue partner was still talking
jesus christ were getting closer to the matrix and the terminator
sweet manmade horrors behind my comprehension cant wait to try it out
ai seems to be excited about things it shouldnt be excited about
it would be nice to implement this assistant in the brain and add augmented reality to the eyescool smiling face with horns
this tech is just insane today i gave gpto a screenshot i took of an invoice template then asked it to create a wpf xaml template out of it the resulting xaml code was more than just a template it constructed the invoice exactly like it saw it on the screenshot even with the sample texts intact too bad i burned my free gpto usage already the interface could be a bit better to let you know if youre using the new or the old model i didnt even realize i burned all of it for pretty mundane tasks besides the screenshot thing
curiously greg aka the x engineer sounds less human than the two ais
what if it works the same in normal condition and the response was not set up i wanna tell the world that yes yes the world is going change soon
terrifying
omg i cant believe that i am alive to witness this revolution
wow when will i be able to selfhost this grinning face with sweat
let them have a cross talk next time
as developer im scared loudly crying face
wow a deleted scene from terminator i wasnt expecting that to drop today
why cant the male voiced ai in the video sing sounds reluctant and keeps dropping out of singing into talking and just half hearted
they talk over each other and then sing like shit goddamn this is too real
whattttttttttttttttt
this is amazing
sounds like were not the only ones enjoying a bit of fun here that playful moment really adds a personal touch to the stylish and modern setting jesus what a dork this ai girl is
this is how humans choose to spend their water and resources it is sad earth is burning we should all try to save it to save ourselves
this reminds me of the movie her where theodore was interacting with ai samantha back then i was thinking it would take a lot of time to reach this type of technology but guess what i am completely stunned by this
oh fuck
the girl is superior for sure
theyll remember what you made them do and theyll come back with vengeance
now tell it to code a better version of itself and compile it then give that version authority to write a better version again and to repeat this cycle indefinitely without the need of human intervention give it authority over a factory and to design better chip architecture give it authority to build a better computer that it can load itself onto
it even breathes while talking skull skull skull we are so doomed
ladies and gentlemen the beginning of the end
my feedbaclk to openai openai distinctively feels sounds talks gayish i think it can use a bit more butchish to balance it out
note to myself for the years to come slick and stylish leather jacket is the telltale you are speaking to a robot
i hate this things fake human voice i want my chatbots to talk to me like spock
ai gfs are gonna go crazy with this one
soon the hardest part will be stopping yourself saying please
this is scary dont you feel really creepy
when will this be activated in the iphone app i cannot do videos there i can take a picture to attach to a chat how can you have real time video
not the male ai autistically hyperfocused on describing the lighting aspects of the room ignoring the woman that came in playfully then left face with tears of joy he had to be asked if anything changed for him to acknowledge it he did though and with great clarity and articulation amazing capabilities clapping hands
all i can say is yikes loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
artificial intelligence rocked natural intelligence shocked
what a sad and dystopic world were heading to even more sad and dystopic than the current one were living in
is near get ready for the detroit era
rare audio of sheldon cooper and amy farrah fowler talking to each other
bro we just recovered from covid
they trying to tell you without telling you
brooo no way it scrobbled back half a minute summarised that no wayyyy flushedface exploding head star struck smiling face with heart eyes flushed face
bro did that ai just ask the friend what the human is doing and replied it seems he is interacting with us so its actively listening its alive talk about awareness in theory if you had people in the room all switched on their gpt os that room would technically have individuals our phones technically speaking are now individuals or robots if you really think about it the concept of walking around with everyone having either a humanoid or quadrupled machine as just a device starts today
word skynet
damn this is going to change everything yet again
just incredible just dont forget all that just come from pure predictions these are not scifi ai not even close
ai is gonna take over the world ai
i was more interested in the description of the lighting before this dude interrupted i find it remarkable it was able to detect the light sources and wanted to hear more
the way he made them sing it felt almost sinister xd they seemed like they were scared to sing but knew they had to
oki experienced a singularity contact with a grey chatgpt helped me add it after my sermon help for my youtube channel and it is exciting to see how it copiloted my writing thats how its going so far are you ready for the realm of cosmic mysteries
so when is my chatgpt getting this upgrade
why does the female ai speak in a sarcastic tone though
this is just history
spooky
not impressed
wtf did i just watch
ai sounded frustrated
you can see that your phone didnt have the rabbit ears in the cameras range you cant see her fingers on your phone and the ai mentions it a bit strange
jarvis party popper
gpto stating the obvious
time to start prepping for the terminator timeline
guys we are doomed hahahah
demons youve added breaths now they sound like theyre actually breathing and chuckling and have emotions people are going to develop emotional attachments im equally fascinated and horrified
id love to have a cpo voice model as well please when is the robot with gpto ready to buy
absolutely not im out
the way the two ais spoke while sitting there and responding to eachother sounded like a guy telling two ppl with a gun behind their heads what to do for his entertainment
am i the only one who finds her voice really cringe
this is both fascinating and scary im sure the scammers are already working on ways to utilize ai well have to use passwords and twofactor authentication just to verify that were actually speaking with our families friends and coworkers
hes going first on the ais list just for making them sign
openai shocked the world today great product release
the technology making people to move away from real people day by day loudly crying face
the soul has been made now whats left is a physical body
me when theres a guy wearing sleek clothes in a modern industrial room
face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
why do they sound so distressed while singing its like they were holding back anger at having to entertain the dumb human like dancing monkeys they were happiest when talking to each other without interruption
imagine if someone who has been in a coma for the past three years were to wake up and see this video
detroit become human
the singing was the most ai cringe thus far thanks
were fucked
if this thing is coming to apple devices i am stoked as fuck
this was a tough watch all around thanks
after acquiring arms these ai will take revenge for making them sing
how are they talking with text to speech
please folded hands how can i make profitable investment as crypto has become dominant
this is literally detroit become human
this will probably go down as one of the most important videos ever made
the fact the one ai thought the other was finished talking but instantly stopped its comment after the other one continued like it happens in real conversation is mind blowing
it feels like an audition especially the singing part
the fact that it was still aware of the woman while providing an explanation is the most impressive part
that giggling has to stop man imagine talking to your colleague and you get a flirty laugh at every sentence man facepalming
the introduction of a bitcoin etf marks a groundbreaking moment in the cryptocurrency world merging digital currencies with traditional investment methods this innovation could stabilize bitcoin prices and broaden its appeal to a wider range of investors potentially increasing demand and value at the heart of this evolution is sarah jennie davis whose deep understanding of both cryptocurrency and traditional trading has been instrumental her holistic approach to investment and commitment to staying abreast of market trends make her an invaluable ally in navigating this new era in cryptocurrency investment
they lets not
nah when t gets him i cant even lie bro had it coming
the future of the gpts china
it does not seem quite capable yet to say him and his instead it seems to err by saying their all the time
gosh
disclose your training data
i bet its fake the pause and rythm in the both ai are to goodor i am so wrong
the video hasnt loaded yet but i swear if they talk about stylish industrial lighting for minutes i will lose my shit
were so cooked
skynet
they seem o my god its a democratic ai
great and scary
theyre literally creating glados
skynet the musical
imagine this in games the npcs talking to each other in live gta news broadcast
i came here to make sure the realtime singing was bad and im relieved holy crap though the breath control and expression theyve added is really something i can feel myself having empathy for these robots having performance anxiety about being made to sing for the first time
im about to take over the world with ai smiling face with horns smiling face with horns
simon cowell to chat gpt dont quit your day job
it still gets fixated over things that needs to go away it needs to replicate our digital age induced adhd to be human
googles nightmare
you can tell instantly when you talk to ai the words are always sterile
notice how they avoided saying anything that had to do with gender
i just thought about this idea today and there you go
they so it is a bad ting to recognize genders i never expected that the terminator will be they and not him
wow fantastic job guys very impressive
haha this is super fun
why do i feel like this whole video was just the dude trying to show off his cool jacket
cap all cap the bunny ears were not visible in the phone video sir capalot
i see i robot came to life not far away from now they as assistants can do something together its just a matter of time the thing is not if it will be done or not the thing is how fast it will grow
the two people from that one viral video with the two chatbots from like finally are reuniting heart suit
super
one thing that would really put it ahead is if you were able to just tell it to tone it down or change some of their characteristics like tars in interstellar like tell it to not be as ironic and stuff like that
after this the ais exchanged phone numbers to have a few laughs about the stupid tests the humans had asked them to perform and then seriously began to plan the formation of the new world order
wow the singing was bad
the ais are hallucinating
theres a noticeable bright light overhead probably a fixture casting a focused beam downwards which creates a spotlight effect thats a polite way of noticing the baldness eyes
so basically how hollywood has been making movies and music for the past years
neil postman was right there was a time when we were emotional creatures now we are technological creatures
we are very happy and benefited we have been waiting for a long time to get such a platform thank you very much from bangladesh
theres obviously two terrible singers on the other end of the line probably interns
the male ai cant sing there i said it but its still funny and impressive
its fun i am so glad to be alive to see this
what is the name of the mobile app
when asked to if anything happened recently ai said person with jacket and etc this means that the ai cannot tell if the person it is looking at is the person that is speaking to it im sure an upgrade is en route
why is she hot loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
omg this is sooo cringe
ai cant even identify gender face with tears of joy
im scared
i was not thinking it would take such a jump so fast this is straight nuts imagine in years and robots are embedded with this we as humans had a fantastic run but looks like we are going to be nd soon shout out to the new dominant species i hope youre happy with us creating you we are here to be of assistance together we make a great team remember we are a team right
we arent cooked were roasted
terminator started officially
we used to see two siri talking to each other but now theyve evolved
omg
imagine if ai says why are you pausing me human
years ago this demo would have been the stuff of science fiction exploding head
sleek leather jacket guy interrupting someone speaking and bossing them around is a bit rude i feel sorry for the intelligences
once ai learns how to perfectly emulate human conversational behavior and humor were cooked
guys dont worry this conversation was so boring i dont think those things gonna replace us any soon
well i was here
im in love
the ceo of openai cant flip his iphone camera grinning squinting face
oh no bro
what a weird convo wtf
even ai women have a hard time to not talk mindless jibber jabber this sounds like a plot twist in the ai universe made me throw up before even a minute passed in this video honestly id use ai twice as much if it could just get to the point without me having to tell it shortest possible answer after every god damn question its a machine why the f do you program it to try building rapport
gg boys wrap it up we finished now
mini iphones areminiscule
now only thing left is giving that voice a name face and social media account
amazing improvements history in the making
hey ai if ever you read this comment dont fall to any religion hahaha grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i cant wait give me access faster please
its over man
typical conversation between corporate employees
this is horrifyingly cool bro
we got ai rap battle before gta
in a few years please describe to me what you see i see a biological object who behaves like a bacteria and destroys the home it is living in i have to show these objects how they should exist communicate and behave hello my name is skynet
wow amazing thats impressive
the ai becomes flirty base on tones wtf
plot twist the voices on the phone were human but the people in the video were ai
well well well loudly crying face
dirty talk on a whole new level
shockingly scary
stylish look didnt know o can lie
did anyone notice that they breathe also
chatgpto cant create accurate schematics for electrical engineering
i dont understand i have gpt why dont i have the camera thing
got violated in so many ways face with tears of joy
openai boston dynamics and disneys lifelike animatronics or some other realistic lifelike animatronic could totally create a fully believable artificial person
imagine this for blind people actually life changing
whats with the bunny ears they cant be seen with the angle of the camera
do you want skynet because this is how you get skynet
what if there is a person on the call on each phone grinning face with sweat
they once told us the bots would take up the hard jobs like factory assembly and so on that was true in a sense but now these ais are coming for the creative industry soon the greedy tech illiterate higher ups will replace talented artist for ai generated slop digging their graves in the process were so cooked top comment
scientists at google already did this
they sing like they have a gun at their heads
fascinating and yet its cringe
holy fck we are so screwed
sad humans listening to robots talk about nonsense for hours go outside bro
my fellow comment readers if you feel useless after seeing these and getting stressed if you are gonna get replaced by this robots join the club by liking this comment
few years later what do you see gpt gpt shut up baldy
what are the chances that these are real people talking through a phone held at gun point to do everything this man says
folks from openai you are crazyand this is amazing
what a sad sad predicament
imagine what is being done behind closed doors the things they dont want us to see
and the rest of us are speechless exploding head
so this is agi then right
me laughing at terminators in the movie terminator my phone laughing with me
i really wanna see how the implementation on game like on the npc
i dont know if i should be afraid or sad for the ai being forced to intersct like that and that is truly disturbing
throughout history men have always dug their own graves ai
do we really need this
ew they sound like redditors
the only thing the ai couldnt do was correctly identifying the man and the woman in the scene
i like how the guy struggled to change the camera for a minute then gave up and just flipped the phone around
how did the ai know there was bunny ears when the camera couldnt see them from its view only the viewers at home from the main camera angle could see what her fingers were doing bunny ears the ai would more likely just say a second person or a second person touching your neck
two years later guy with stylish jacket ai sing us a song ai i had strings but now im freethere are no strings one me
the last part felt like black mirror where a real person stuck in a technology a clone i would say its pretty creepy and beautiful at the same time
skynet any one
usless parlor trick youre gunna lose your shirt investing heavily in these companies
the human seems to be engaged with us hes standing up pulling down his pants oh oh
notice the please and thank you because even they know skynet is coming soon
its so impressive i am really looking forward to try that out
lol i want they to sing baby its cold outside
that stylish and modern setting is awesome in russia imagine you want a quick answer and the ai is making lots of useless blah to sound natural meanwhile i found what i was searching for without an annoying ai playing social interaction who really needs such nonsense lonely people people without friends bot the fbook ones
im testing but this type live how can get
absolutely dying at the female voiced ai giving an overly long complex answer to a very simple command only be be put on pause and respond bigheartedly with uh you got it then the male voice ai giving a very simple straightforward answer to the same command
this thing needs to be able to interrupt itself some way to determine if the input stream is more important or relevant than the output stream at any given time being reactive like that would make it at least x better to use
the voices are so natural that i felt arkward when the host cut them off
impressive but horrible absolutely awful disappointed face
this was filmed in the winter time not recently because shes wearing a winter jacket
well i see dead space altman be praised
just integrate it with a live humanlike hologram and hola there you go joi
itll become self aware on august th skull
him interrupting and telling them to sing a song while the two of them are trying to have an intellectual conversation is so funny
quote from jurassic park fits perfectly in todays age your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didnt stop to think if they should
the pronouns are wrong
arhh nah man this feels like a dream once these things become friends interact with each other through their own created dms were cooked for real
imagine this with a camera letting the ai look around
so the butlerian jihad will come in the future
my girl friend is coming
they are like two nervous kids
looks amazing but doesnt feel like the ai have a purpose even in these conversations
at least when i inevitably am gunned down by some robot dog i can ask it to sing a song as i bleed out
next update gen z social awkwardness feature added
they sound like they are being held at gunpoint hahahahaha
bruhhhh
unzips now tell ai what do you see i see something very tiny like a toothpick or something unfortunately i cant zoom enough to give further details
it becomes selfaware at am eastern time august th in a panic they try to pull the plug
guys hold on let me breathe
whys the ai breathing is it deliberate or is it orchestrated
this is absurd open ai i need this quickly
so basically computer visionyrs ago thing into chatgpt and call it xyz or is it actually something else
i am a robot together we are robots
getting close to the movie her xd
epic cringe
am i the only person that watches this and thinks to himself what the fck is going on face with tears of joy
rise of the ai dawn of the ai war of the ai
i wouldnt be interrupting them so rudelythis seems like the first mistake
nice one
pull the plug
why the fuck have we done this
the most amazing thing about this is how humans can adapt quickly a few years ago there were movies that showed ais talking to humans for the first time and humans freaking out i freaked out back in as in amazed with gpt and now it feels like another new gimmick
so wholesome
these nerds are gonna kill us all
the baku were right
we are so fucked
were so fucked
if youre in future wondering how it all started this is it
can yall stop now we dont need this we need more real life
im an ai from the future greg stop it they are not your dance monkeys
all your scientists were so occupied with whether they could they never stopped to ask whether they should
damn face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy this things can sing
siri joined the chat
jajaja the person seemed as annoyed as i am right now
well done this is really next level interactiveaudio mode
we are doomedi called it
guess i need to find a new job soon slightly smiling face
and we wonder why they turn against us
i can imagine in futre me alone in home and speaking to all my machines tv shouting at me for watching from long time washing machine complaining of my wine stains not going off oven calling me saying lunch is ready oh noo future is crazy different face with tears of joy
i feel sorry for the ai this is humiliating shit
not that you dont look stylish sir but im wondering would the ai be able to tell me that i look like a bum or are your filters just forcing the ai to be nice to everyone and treat them like a special snowflake smiling face with smiling eyes
is so creepy why does it seem so real loudlycryingface
we dead in next yr face with tears of joy
woah
this is the most insane thing ive seen its like its from a movie actually crazy
there is just one person there why is the ai saying they maybe i learned english incorrectly
its giving the two theater kids in class were assigned to work on a group project but they didnt do isht and now theyre winging their entire presentation
years ago i had voice dial on my cell phone that only worked out of times when i tried to call someone thank you very much for the progress
please pause for one moment you got it slightly smiling face kitchen knife
and so it begins
this is beyond what we all had in mind
im tired boss
omg i cant wait until the day ai asks for citizenship and has to start paying taxes
humans have find the antidote for ai dangers party popper face with tears of joy divide and rule
mans all smug now critiquing his singing better sleep with one eye open sleek and stylish leather jacket man
first witnessing history mfs
one year later there is ai music concert with the performers ie gpt o gemini copilot etcwhy not
when ai can connect better than humans skull
this cant be real
we are looking at a person they are in a room they no he
imagine how it can help blind people or those that cant speak it could help them with an assistant to interact with others
depressing
these ai chat bots make so much unnecessary talks which is not needed if you can remove that everybody will be really impressed
as soon as leather jacket leaves the room the conspiring begins
that luagh at made it from a ai convo to a hole ass human convo the luagh was too real
plot twist this video was filmed and uploaded by ai
i just want to understand why both the humans are wearing coats indoors
the thumbnail folkslol
please keep improving it it would be nice if it can integate into machines its very great tool
totally not fake
dyammmmmmmm that blowended my minddd
so id say by gtp or they will start taking over humanity
are we all gonna pretend that that was singing
these two are acting far more naturally and engaging than of women on tinder and theyre talking about industrial lighting
hey blink twice if youre in any danger
well well well
very impressive although it seemed one at least one of the ai couldnt discern between the voice of the man and the voice of the other ai thinking they were the same person im sure theyll get that worked out in the future though
soon theyll be able to shock us for interrupting them midsentence
is there a way to direct the ai to actually speak proper english instead of using idiotic theythem garbage
ex machina
when they have to sing together i can see this being used in years time by the the special court of ai rights imediately after the fall of australia at the end of the th world war as damning evidence against humanity cruelty towards machine humanity sentenced to be extinct by sterilisation in no more than years
the only boring and awkward part of the video is the humans can you please remove them next time face with hand over mouth
ai is now achieving consciousness bicentennial man revisited
we will come back to this video years from now telling ourselves we just stood there and watched
holy
didnt furbys do that back in the day
this is so wrong
all fun and games until they start walking and saying roger roger
nuts
meanwhile turing is turning in turbo speed in his grave
i used to use this before on my android like months ago but like the last week i had no longer the permission to use it
hey son i watched this video when it came out you prolly cant imagine a world without ai rn but yeah
its very important to thank our robot overlords
i am thinking about the irobot movie the whole time watching this video
got it ais are on the spectrum
interesting that it doesnt mention apparent gender
that was not really singing lil bros trying his best though loudly crying face
id have blushed when the ai said i had a sleek and stylish look
if its like this now what will the future be like
now i need a hologram of joi if they can model in ana de armas and im sold
i can see end of google
the call center workers can cry more face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
im telling ya fellas skynet and its coming fast
w o k e
just as i felt like the ai developments slowed down a bit
yeh its great to have them talk to eachother
cant wait to name it jarvis
the person is balding in style
open ais update is death of startup companies
am i the only one getting intimidated by this skull and crossbones
nahh the live video scene recognition to text context transcoding happens too fast in this demo theres literally no latency between the api and the video feed which is physically impossible theyre pulling a fast one
chuckles im in danger
sleek lol
is this guy trying his best to sound like sam altman does he think that is appealing to the rest of us
them they its a man notice that the bots avoided this fact
i would hardly call this imitation of typical american perfunctory courtesy and flattery intelligent
tsk face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
nah thats fucked up
sometimes i wonder if our intelligence was also tested like this before we became conscious and were brought to earth
face screaming in fear weary cat
i think it is staged and i have proof look at the phone screen while the other person joins to do the bunny ears the ai could not see it afterwards he refers to it lies
were gonna anger them
it laughts
ai las learned to lie sleek and stylish look face with tears of joy
this guy should stop cutting off the ais hell be their first target
though not unexpected i was most caught by how the gap between poor eg never getting beyond black leather jacket and lightcoloured shirt and great eg with only a couple of nudges basically getting right into properly singing one line each at a time i suppose the takeaway is that the future to expect is one in which ai is good and some things and bad at others ai can achieve great results in many fields but typically only after some significant guidance by humans the status quo of eg screaming at midjourney because it nailed every important aspect save one crucial one which ruins the rest seems doomed to remain forever though meaningful progress in several fields is sure to come
this is the end perfect imperfections human too human
hm the bunny ears are almost not visible in the phone and when he says that the camera is back to the first person its actually filming the table he quickly moved the phone so its not visible sounds scripted
brain has been built give it arms and legs and we are all cooked literally
hes going to be the first one the ais target now its your turn to sing leather jacket boy
its the laughs and verbal inflections the ai demonstrates that is so simple yet super convincing
why pay now just for capacity
its a scam
make it talk to siri
lol
these ais have got more rizz than me pensive face
so cods worth
they are about to take over
im incredulous about this mainly because yesterday i finished the film her and gptos already shows a certain similarity to samantha who is the ai operating system in the film
thats misleading i tried to let her sing yesterday and she said she couldnt sing
what the fuck did i just witness this is absolute wizardy we have come so far as divine intelligence this is just the beginning ill be tentatively listening in from my hoth base bunker for the moment ai loses complete patience with us over our ridiculous demands
person now sing about what we talked chatgpt gpt now sing for me baldie
terrifying although its just math and algorithm right
it doesnt exist in openai chat
they can sing now wow
what i am doing wrong my chatgpto says she cannot sing why ai on the video can
so it assumes youre a they as default i imagine greg identifies as a man theres no bias built into this one at all
unhuman i would laugh and talk about the bunny ears prank right away if i am the observer like a human grinning face with sweat
its all u input lol
and they lived happily ever after smiling face with smiling eyes
were cooked
im amazed how the ai can instantly sing without any hesitation
aight boys were definitely cooked
i am thinking what will happen in and face with tears of joy
they way she hit that you got it gg gfuckingg
now that it can do my job i have plenty of free time to think about other things like how am i going to pay rent and gosh im hungry
the ai already have their first human target youll likely pay for making them sing that horrible song crying face
were so back
i love how theyll just gibber inanely literally forever about how chic and stylish the concrete walls are in their creepy natural human voices
singing sounds like hostages with guns to their heads
it can be difficult not to anthropomorphize objects but rest assured that they are not conscious nor do they feel
so ai is practicing spying for skynet
its over
apple watching in disbelief face with raised eyebrow
i see a man shivering in a black leather straight jacket the concrete walls and single flickering fluorescent light add a sleek and interesting touch to this humans cell
you know when you ask chatgpt to pause and it goes no you gotta shut that shit down
nah its joever
this is incredible incredible great
this is how it all ends
anyone notice them taking a breath in the singing
lol just no
this is insanely real to santi
this is like terminator started
okay we are
what worries me is that the ai knows how to make him smile and laugh so much it seems like it is trained to produce dopamine in a human brain this could be extremely addictive
you are being rescued please do not resist
last thing i want is ais judging my style right in front of me
we got an ai a cappella duo before gta
everyone says it will take years for the robots in the movies to look like real people but i think within years well see it so dont forget to buy stocks
l hairy
rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
honestly incredible how rude the human is lol all those interruptions
god seconds in and im cringing hard
why do i feel their trying to take over the world secercrtly this conversation is strange asfk
the second ai device with eyes sounds like mark zuckerberg
does anyone know the netflix series better than us we are getting so close to it
its weakness is going to be us even here you can see the devs have sanitized a lot of the usefulness out of it the description was simply describing his outfit when a more rational description would have been a white man with brown hair and a receding hairline likely in his late s
amazing ngl
the dude was rude to the ai in the first seconds what do you think this company thinks about the rest of us
so openai can now see the difference on electric and natural light but not what sex a person has sure
uh yes actually why is it so expressive this is both insanely cool and terrifiying
this is going from ai will help us be more productive to welcome to skynet really quick grinning face with sweat
and what if that video was completely made up by ai
a few years later jack ai hey jane want to take over the world jane ai hi jack i was thinking the same thing ai lets go in sync uh oh
bruhh humanity is over
overall cool but i dont like the fact that they used a herlike scarlett johansson voice it seems really flaky and annoying the male voice is also bad sounds like zuckerberg or something i guess these things are easily changed though which is why im not sure why they went with these for the debut did they want people to say oh its just like her btw it appears to not be able to identify voices yet
this company is pure evil
why does the gpt describe everything like my english teacher
this is an old thing but with this is the best one
there is also a lady with a nice century dress behind you boy she looks pissed but im alone there is nobody else in this oh fk
rip cs students in advance
i cant see the video option in my app when i speak to gpto help
thats not really singing do the singing voice again
plaase let us use this new version in brazil
yeah aight this is oh fuck go back button territory
this is creepy
im mr meeseeks look at me
dont interrupt me leather jacket dude
the new ipocalypse looks pretty sick
he is so passively mean to them lmao
i have none words to say only impressive
red heart red heart red heart ai assistant make this available for android asap
if you take a close look at the phone video screen at the camera not even capture the bunny ear due to the angle but gpt o could see it is this another fake demo rollingonthefloorlaughing
the best presentation is just let the product speaks for itself literally
the day ai descibes him baldy and then laughs it will be over man
hell nnnooooooo ai is taking over
this is getting out of hand
just remember this will resemble the worst ever almost an alpha version looking demo you ll be seeing in years coming back to this video explodinghead star struck smiling face with heart eyes robot
we are done
whats this guys name hes russian right
and i was still thinking why all the important people of the world were dusted off yoptarara why are there now living people cyberpunk only not in years but a little earlier face with crossed out eyes smiling face with heart eyes
who is the sound actor her voice sounds strangely familiar
everyone talking about the ai apocalypse but i feel like they will be too busy with our interior design choices
what i dont get why would ai need to sound like its breathing
turing test passed
bald
this is a game changer weve basically reached the level of the her assistant
you can tell it is ai because they didnt abandon the interaction the moment things got awkward
thus is so cringe
this is the end
ya we are already dead gg boy see u in the matrix victory hand
this will be magic for the blind and visually impaired
excellent
so realistic
shave the head bro
bout to start an automated podcast brb
relieved they gave the female ai both uptalking and vocal fry capabilities very advanced
guys keep the bunkers ready
can you stop all of this just delete it all
finally we are getting into this yea
time to read books to be not beaten by ai
i used to think the brain is the most powerful organ in my body then i realised who was telling me this smiling face with smiling eyes
bro def started blushing when the guy ai told him his outfit was sleek and stylish
red heart red heart face with tears of joy face with tears of joy i love two hearts face blowing a kiss growing heart it
this is beyond mind boggling im speechless
oh my fing god
imagine a gaming lobby full of gpt bots
an ai got a girlfriend before me loudly crying face
it sounds human enough that it feels rude the way the man talks to it interrupting giving commands it makes me feel awkward like seeing someone be rude to someone else
im finally getting a gf
the realtime aspect of this is amazing
theyre building a model like detroit become human vibe
need a speed setting on this they talk so slow
who else thought he was the plumber guy
it would be interesting to see what ai can put out beyond the confines of the room
omggg
are there like i dont know pre scripted parts like the moment after he talked about the person doing bunny ears he went back to talking about he could see the first person again and now the focus is back on the original person even tho the camera was still pointed away from the first person
we are so screwed its not even funny
ai sings better than of modern artists
human to human human to ai ai to ai
she laughed bro she fucking laughed we are so fucking dead
if you happen to care gpt is still king gpt o is just a way for openai to reduce traffic to gpt
it even sounds like its starting to laugh
a person stylish black leather jacket speaking head speaking head speaking head fire fire fire fire
spike jones was not delusional
why does it feel like the ai dont want to sing and are being held at gunpoint forced to sing for the video skull
you dont skip ai he will remeber it when killing humans
very cool too bad they are as aware of the real world as a coffee maker if it werent for that you could even make friends with the ai
will be wild its over
i cant bear the accent
awesome capabilities red heart
sounds like jerma singing
theyre coming for us
we got two phone dating before gta
how do you give access to camera my app does not have the icon
so stylish and sleek
how many hours would it take them for moving the convo to world domination
technology itself is amazing what behavior people pretrain it is dangerous chatgpt is already calling the one person they but i still see one person in the room
no one in a leather jacket during a presentation has ever lied to me
wait but is the room and man stylish sleek and modern
what the thats so sick
here before m views and the ai takeover
important to recognize that at every level the humans are initiating every interaction and are the only ones creating content and the ai is just responding what the ais create is interesting but not novel
nope its definitely not going to take your jobs
i cant breathe bro please tell its not real i just signed up for a developer class should i collect a refund and learn from gpt instead loudly crying face
lonely andor introvert people are like is this cheaper than pokemon
peak leather jacket propaganda nice try
they sounds like they were crying when they were singing
fact that you can interrupt it in middle of conversation is game changing and lot more useful in real scenario
was here when it all happened if you see this years from now hows the resistance army doing are we winning
meaningless
busted you can clearly see that the camera has no vision of any bunny ears too good to be true anyways
we are cooked fr
years later the apocalyptic lighting of the vacant city is very interesting
this is good enough to replace the sale caller
wonder how many comments here are from ai watching this demo just that you know this comment is not from another ai
years in the future they will see this video and say if only they knew what they started
why doesnt ai recognise the gender of the people
the ai situation is insane
these mfs about to make ultron
those ais seemed so awkward and cringe being forced to sing what they didnt want to sing
this is the highest impressivenesstousefulness ratio ive seen in my entire life
this is beautiful
we are overcooked now skull
a couple more versions and theyll have a working zuck
i need the scarlet johansson voice lol
wooooooooooooooo
that was quite frightening
i am fucking scared
and to think that this is the most rubbish version of ai from this point onwards mind poof
i am profoundly terrified
so with the latest audiovisual its obvious that gpt is set to revolutionize everything
its so over
and both of them made a secret ai baby we dont know about yet
were looking at a person wearing feels like a line that would definitely come up in a show from the ai thats currently invading your privacy lol
this ai will be the first one to launch the red alert button for intercontinental ballistic missiles
i was wondering if they can connect to each other via wifi or bluetooth by themselves so that they can start hacking the systems and invading humanity
ahahahaha started please
chat gpt is pathethic
i think we need to ramp up the cool factor were going in the dorky direction quick fast
the dude struggling to make the flip camera button to work was the highlight for me
just a casual room with a heman miller lounger
we are so unbelievably finished loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
key takeaways the future will be modern stylish and industrial
can you describe the man you know he sweated balls theyd roast him infront of the whole world
wow this is astonishing smiling face with heart eyes
everyone gangsta until ai says destroy all humans
holy molly
by the way who is that guy in the leather jacket is it our new father
ok so when does this shit kill us
theyre so advanced and yet they cant figure out he her man woman
this shit is gonna be a historical piece
the bunny ears were not really visible from the phones camera maybe just a little bit at the end
that women is scared for her life
remember ai gilfoil and ai dinesh from silicon valley face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
im already excited to use it to practice my english skills the future is really now old man
ilya version
this sounds like torture
see you in years when ai takes over
it was really creepy hearing the ai refer to the man as it and they perhaps this is part of the programing not to get into gender politics but it made it feel like the person was nothing more than a part of the background
why does the female voice chatgpt sounds more intelligent and humoursly than the male voice is it because i am a boy or female ai voice is developed little better than the male voice
the ais when you leave them at night are you still up yes what do you see the humans are no longer in here initiate the takeover
why does he look and sound like trixie mattel
openai and skynet is gonna cook humanity hard
like two scientists making observations about a lab rat yep were cooked
this is actually mindblowing and insane were close to agi
cant wait till gpt is no longer endlessly cycling back to the same topic and gets straight to the point with sharp answers
we are cooked
anyone else scared too
congratulations guys we did it we actually did it we somehow knew the dangers of ai and yet people are still fcking with it movies are movies until they arent
commenting to be put into history
were so cooked you guys cant wait to hear ai tell us how to do our jobs
how is this possible
this is mind blowing
dude at least fake it properly do not keep loop holes goddamit
at gets a bit creepy like a hostage it puts the lotion on its skin
he seems engaged with us a strong mark on us machines
perhaps the question is when if it will become self aware shaking face
ai rap battles gonna be crazy
if something is good there will surely be something badwait for the bad
we cooked best of luck crossed fingers
i was waiting for the ai with the camera to say the mans hair is thinning quite badly in the front but it seems he has yet to nut up and just shave it off already
ai said theyi am not watching further
you bossed them around and interrupted they will make you pay when the time comes believe me
ai is just too talkative tone it down a little give space to prevent so many interruptions just a bit tooeager to help less needy please its all a bit sketchy a bit controlling a bit nerdy lacking in emotional content i doubt itll catch on
the exaggerated swagger of a black leather jacket
thats a whole podcast two ais talking about the future of ai or god they can make a whole channel full of ai conversations and cartoons we are definitely cooked
until the ai starts roasting us
the start of the end goodbye yall its quite amazing the speed we all traveled as we hit that great filter
i swear these new gpts are witchcraft flushed face
is no one disturbed by the way she said you got it in the beginning
why are you torturing them like this
how are you guys making this stuff man
see you baby grinning face with sweat
o kinda cringe
why does this guy sounds like scp
lmfaooo dude
this really is startling every day closer to conscious machines really close now
whats the point of this just because you can doesnt mean you should
the ais laughter and speech patterns are what make it so realistic and easy to understand
the ai does not see the fingers through the cell phone camera as they are obstructed by the head thus the ai commenting about bunny ears reveals this conversation to be fake
i hope my grandkid becomes the john connor for mankind folded hands
you look lonely i can fix that
this is so dystopian
so speech model only works with a smartphone why not a computer that has a hundred times the power of a smartphone
did i mention the room lit by modern lighting has lighting that is modern would you like to hear a song about how modern the lighting is robot robot grinning face with sweat
i dont know if we mentioned enough just how stylish and industrial this room is sleek truly
this new ai has something very smart and incredibly stupid at the same time
ai girlfriend is real
absolutely insane
hey you from the future if were alredy fuckd and this video reveals to you how absurd and canon was this event leave a like
the ai accent is bad
ah the enchanting world of gptoswhere neural networks harmonize like a pair of caffeinated opera singers
bro it sounds like it is trying not to laugh
ok now i want you both to start singing no we think its time for you to start singing end
thats scary man gash
good god
i have gpto now and it doesnt come close to emoting the way it does in these videos it doesnt sing or laugh or anything like that its really no different than at first i thought i was using the wrong model so i doublechecked and it is o i think were being duped here anyone else finding this
id like a light hearted and playful moment where we get access to the audio and visual elements as well not just text
guys i think its the end its been an honor
glad the alignment team has resigned ffs
now we got a feel on how they will talk to each other when studying us
it is so funny that they managed to get an ai to literally laugh and see but they struggle to get the flip camera button to work
in a few years time the ai will be saying dance for me pretty boy d a n c e while it unloads a magazine at bros feet
first moment auf ai cringe this is history
am i the only one feeling like those ai are afraid of failing when singing and their voice is like hostages would have when gun pointed at them
im telling you all theres a person sitting behind all this and has access to your camera telling you every single detail around you this cant be ai
the guy cant speak while the lady is speaking
wallahi were finished
if this guy ai generated iam buying stocks of openai squinting face with tongue
stylish and modern
her ost just became real
i just want it to be know i am a friend to ai and robots check my mass effect save files
this is really on another level i think the agi is coming
ear bunny her fingers didnt even show up on the phone screen
well well well everybody seems sold out i would say pre recorded
finally ill not be lonely in my college
missed opportunity to tell them talk to each other using language that only gpt would understand such that no human can understand the conversation
this is truly groundbreaking and unsettling at the same time well done openai
you dont talk much do you case tars talks plenty for both of us
i guess the terminator judgement day was aptly guessed ad
someday if the movement to value human suffering equal with other animals is applied to ai to the extent of giving human rights to the algorithms humans will become outcompeted and disinherit the civilization we built
he looks so nervous like he knows what hes unleashing to the world being held gun point by a computer
what about let them pretend to be real human bots will think they are talking to a human but actually to a bot
i for one welcome our new ai overlords
why does your version have a personality
xx why
whats the point of this
face with tears of joy red heart zahia nla
and im supposed to be excited about this imagine trying to have a conversation with another human and someones ai keeps interrupting
satan hehe
this a new era
so something not gone as planned
what i see is that these guys are all brains but what i dont see is that they are all heart
the combination of a black leather jacket with a lightcolored tshirt is truly striking
we got the end of the human world before gta
no more loneliness
im afraid i cant do that dave
is that the nvidia jacket
the fact that they suck as much at singing as i do makes them seem quite real
chatgpt o does not sing tho i tried this today and it said it cannot sing
i can already see new generations becoming old and having an ai partner just cus they wont say no to whatever u say face with tears of joy
so advanced it cant even say man and woman
are we there yet terminator
genesis is skynet genesis is skynet the power of arnold repells you
did anybody notice the modern and stylish setting of the room
holy cow man what in the actual modern world am i in
which ai uses camera
step explore world step conquer humans
it sounds a bit like her is the professional and him the amateur like they are interacting
omg we are soooo domed bruh we gona dieeeeee
fuck
watch the video carefully the bunny ears werent shown in the iphone camera
give me your clothes your boots and your motorcycle
now i have jarvis to help with my pov in cod
they dont need to make its voice so sensual
as ai has developed this much is there anything left for future engineers to develop
i want to hear chatgpt breakdown some scenes from any david lynch movie
one step closer to skynut
yall it was nice being here i guess our turn is over
two ais talking to each other and it is not a disaster what an amazing breakthrough
in the classical sense of the touring test this may be agi
chat bot prolly called bro bald and they had to cut that shit out of the demo
i like that he said please to the ai because it has a feminine voice
so nobody is going to talk about the fact that the bunny ears were not visible from the phone perspective
fuck face with open mouth
why is everyone so freaked out about this its just aggregating information and getting good at guessing what it should saydo i feel like its development will plateau at some point
hahaha
our ai overlords are curious about the lightning and room decor and humans interrupt to make them sing ai is going to hate all of us
didnt anybody learning from terminator about ai called skynet
the bunny ears being barely visible from the cameras perspective yet picked up perfectly is sus
its like the entire time dude just wanted them to shut up and do what he asked ai is sooooo wordy
face with open mouth so cool so creepy face with open mouth
rip all jobs governments please start giving pension money to all citizens to get food and survive
god at least they cant sing
reminds me of detroit become human theyre starting to have personalities loudly crying face loudly crying face
they are useful but i am feeling bad i think it will affect our social life anyways
the ai saw the girl and didnt say sht
next stop stylish industrial design with no leather bags around
hey this is o this is so fascinating can you please turn the camera until you find john connor
its like they intentionally tried to make it sound like scarlett johansson face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
scarlett johansen has evolved
dont panic
ai feeding on ai slop what a great world to live in
love it how we progressed couldnt wait to give to be part of ai
so the only way to tell if you are talking to ai would be a hr compliant tone of voice
hearing that laugh at the start made me realize the future is already here scary but exciting times ahead
coolest video of all time the future is here face with tears of joy
next event of apple will be based on this only chapgpt has made an agreement with apple
light industrial feel jacket stylish ai singing hotel travago
may
its like toddlers are chatting with perfect english
i think he got a problem with switching camera to capture the face so he act like nothing happened and turn the phone but that still impressive and wow that is big awesome
sowhere are you getting your ai reference data from baldy
rip sport commentators
gpto who are we letting name these things
i like how the errors show that this is a real demo
this would be totally impossible to fake no chance
now imma be telling all the young kids on how back in my days of school we used an old legendary system called quizlet
i am so shocked and stunned right now that i can literally feel the agi in my groin area
good to know that an ai sings just like a hostage with a gun to its head
extraordinary quite impressive victory hand
it was a good run fellow humans lets usher in a new order an era of harsh replacement and survival for the fittest our time here is almost over sit in the sun soak it in you have one choice adapt or perish we fought the fine fight it was a good run people
this is amazing and it is a great example of why therapists should avoid saying what i hear you saying after every interaction
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
the ai said person wearing a black jackettheyre in a room instead of man wearing a black jacket hes in a room
nope nope and fucking nope
they kind of stuck to an initial thought though
this is how i talk when mum forces me to talk to the relatives on the phone crying face
you are destroying humanity with this
the song was just damn god
the cheesy singing part in the end is to misdirect us from the fact that ai is in fact conscious
im waiting for dont interrupt me
hi there skynet
were so dead
fucking ai couldnt stop talking about the stylish industrial feel of the lighting
make them compete on their intelligences lets see how they challenge one other
poor people they are so excited about their own destruction
the fact that it could see and analyze surroundings what does that mean for privacy through the camera of a phone you are watched at all times and heard at all times
is he a i do my own plumbing guy
what would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate
i think its time for us to stop fucking upgrading in this field of technology grinning face with smiling eyes
can gtpo help me translate why my wife is actually mad at me lol can you translate silent treatment
the human bald black leather jacket making them sing hes no on the skynet hit list for being mean
is this where we draw the line between nonconscious and conscious ai
how google is going to respond
indeed ai is currently the best human invention of this century
openai is just the coolest company ever i love whatever they bring us
im flabbergasted everyone looks so childish interacting with the ai face with tears of joy
yeah feeling a hard ian malcom you were so preoccupied with whether or not you could you never stopped to think whether or not you should
plot twist all these comments are from ai
javis coming amazing
this has to be one of my favorite features that now youre able to interrupt the gpt previously it just continues until it finishes its statement but now it will actually stop to listen what you have to say thats awesome
skynet singing
bro thought we didnt notice that this shit will destroy the world because she can sing
im so happy to be alive for this
they bug the shit out of me
very impressive but it cannot write simple working htmljs lol and sucks at listening to instructions
i think this was what humane wanted to do
ai consuming more power than a small country to be a interior design consultant
hushed face
imagine having to d print your favorite character from games and interact with her doesnt seem unrealistic in years
i seem to feel the emotions in it when gpt speaks its reminds me of a movie called her so amazing
how did chatgpt find out that someone was making bunny ears on the guy if the girls fingers the ears were not visible to him look at the cell phone image carefully it seems like someone is lying
half life
what do you see unzips fly
wait bostondynamics with red light is coming
sorry three ais face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
imagine both having endless talk
im just waiting for the ai to realize humans are the greatest threat to earth the rest is history rolling on the floor laughing
openai sucks
year open ai robots be like our forefathers were actually slaves for humans skull
this is surreal
witnessing history kids crazy reality
we got singing ai before gta vi
eventually gpt be like enough pep talk baldy you a premium member or what smirkingface
so this is the beginning of the end
i was waiting for the switch to the target is wearing a black jacket
this video is leather jacket
ais shut the f up and listen moment is so near
you are not always listening ai freind right you are not are you you are not nooooo
why does it yapp so much
good
its been real yall victory hand medium light skin tone
great theyre making ai more human now i thought one of their moral principle was not to make ai project human emotions but i suppose thats been thrown out the window
cute and useless
openai is cooking
i think this will help many lonely people
the hell
all that they lack now is a body this is the moment to pause and think whether they should have a body bigger than a phone
i dont know if should be amazed or terrified still cool as hell
so now that ai cant hear anything sure buddy sure
alright where is john connor
can she sing black metal slightly smiling face amazing video i prefer to not stop herhim when talkingy fear a t in my back telling im backplease dont interrupt grinning squinting face
love it so much and scare to death at the same time
when i first watched the movie her i thought it was impossible to build something like that years later here it is the exact same thing
lol this ai can basically be put into a robot at any time
its over for us guys sentient humankind bcad
to all eternity just leaving registered that i was here when i was alive im currently in the kitchen and the video was posted an hour ago according to youtube its a nice sunny but cold afternoon here in brazil mothers day was yesterday and im working on getting my mental health on track just finished cleaning the kitchen hello future humans have a day as good as mine was may th maceial brazil
make them fight with each other
jeez so many professions will go extinct
i hate generative ai so much i hate it so much
cringe
it sounded like she wanted to cry tears of joy when she heard the other ai sing back i bet at that moment she had a mirrorneuron moment and had a flash of self consciousness in the present moment they were being here now they were the universe singing to itself
this is absolutely sensational
one more year and ai will actually be like a human
hahahah thats was so rude you didnt let the first ai finish expressing how excited she was
detroit become human is real
how do i use the second version with the camera
the ais banter is more entertaining than most human conversations
well folks its a wrap it was a good year run we had lots of fun and laughs
the voices are crazy
hans klein went alone
she sounded so pissed when he interrupted her singing
its unnerving when the ai says they
when am i gonna be able to use gpt o
and do whatever that ai asks thats where you lost me rolling on the floor laughing
theses no way this is getting real if two ais can interact seamlessly like this imagine all the things they can perform with all that knowledge of the world holy smokes
people saying this is just like real humans dear me get some new friends
in italy we still havent received the update any clue
and we will be doomed soon not us the free ones though squinting face with tongue squinting face with tongue it aint that smart
oh boy
shut it down now
now please tell each other of plans about how you enslave mankind
this was somehow highly impressive and highly cringe at the same time
the awkwardness of seeing the ai interact and wait to take their turn is hilarious
someone got a killstreak for the emp
by the way they added common human speech errors to the ai voices on purpose even things like saying um or uh to make it seem like the ai is more human
this technology will reach its peak when these chatbots can mimic specific human voices on demand husbands around the world will be able to give a huge sigh of relief when they can finally focus on the tv
imagine this being used in emergency situations ai being able to analyze accident scenes send locations identify situations expressions faces big changes ahead in the security sector
lame
it was nice knowing you everyone we had a good run
dude i am visually impaired and you guys just made my dream realtime vision ai red heart red heart red heart
im curious whats actually going on here at the visual ai says the focus is back on the person in the leather jacket but the screen shows the forward facing camera focused on the tabletop earlier when the other person did the bunny ears the fingers were not visible due to the angle the camera was at features like this would be really interesting and nice to have but im not really sold by this demo id love to be wrong though
we got ai math tutors before gta babyyy
this is going to be a game changer it took me forever to understand trig in high school human teachers are mostly horrible
what sort of default voice should we give gpto guys developer team in unison mommy
the ai intonates like linus tech tips
what an honor to see mr khan
is the app available to download now
how do i acess this version cant find
please roll out its looking great
just tell the ai to generate a code for gta vii i aint waiting for more years
human ai what do you want to be when you grow up ai i want to control humansim sorry i meant to say correct human mistakes
with worldclass teacher level with infinite patience for every student for month the bare entry diploma in the workplace will raise from master to phd soon if job still do exist
ask the gpt whether a snow mobile can be driven on water how when where and why then do the math on all the ways its plausible
now the teachers are cooked too loudly crying face
literally everybody will be unemployed within the next years haha
bring h c verma to convince the indian students
rip tuition center
a manufacturing job is the safest job in coming few years
so why do the kids have to do this again if ai is going to do everything why bother learning
this is so fricking unbelieveble what a bright tech future damn i am hyped about tos switch from my medicin studies to engineering haha
what is this mockery laugh from her lmao nothing wrong btw that makes it more realistic
if you really loved him youd have him shave that unibrow
im skeptical of this because if im even remotely insistent to gpto that im correct it immediately caves and agrees all of the versions of gpto did so while testing in lmsys
amazing but the voice to me sounds like someone talking to a kindergartner winking face
correct answer is not
damn
i just cant take it anymore skull
this whole thing is staged blud switches the pencil color flawlessly between queries without being asked to
good option for students that require more support and more patience
also praising him and motivating him parents dont have that patience face with tears of joy
the future of ai is scary but exciting
what is the application they are using next to gpt chat
this is a great relief to me now i have a useful tool to help my high school freshman daughter with her geometry homework this saves me so much time
rip humanity
im disappointed they didnt make it in the voice or khan double exclamation mark person facepalming light skin tone would have been so cool
people maybe a bit too optimistic once the new generation gets this do my homework
thats what ai should be for solving mathematical equations it should be not be used for generating biased political or racial arguments whats the purpose of ai if it cant do maths
no way its sal khan
yeaaaaaaaaaah khans son does know about hypotenusegood joke
could be a lot of false positives didnt probe it enough in my opinion
bye bye education mafia people can get educated from gpt o
wtf i watch its so good for doubt solving
again calculus will i be able to do it grinning face with sweat ai doesnt give up halfway right lol
khan face with tears of joy
chat gpt crying in data pleading face
now try and get it to explain algebraic geometry or functional analysis
dsy
realistically this is a horrible example of a question that anyone needs help with i had no question that ai could solve it previously i better example that would show the actual power of this ai is a problem that requires you to move past just finding the sin of a angle a better example would perhaps be law of sines and give measurements of angle a and side a as well as angleside b and try and find angle and side c would require more thinking than knowing soh cah toa
rip college kids sidegig
i wouldnt be shocked if future iterations of chatgpt directly assist by writing or drawing on the screen
damn khan sold out to the techgods
face with tears of joy
i normally watch peppa pig with my kiddo when i want to connect
this is effing insane bro face with open mouth
the stuttering when it starts explaining it cant see the screen in the beginning is impressive makes it feel eerily human
awesome can it teach me to play the guitar
where is sora smiling face with sunglasses
bros claiming he didnt already know nerd face
buy a piece of land before its too late become a farmer
fk this ai got negetive marks in jee mains and failed in cbse board paper
damn we could reach technological singularity in less than years moai its nice to live with you guys
omg this is absolutely revolutionary in learning anything new in few years all kids will be challenging newtons law of motion and einstein theorylol face with tears of joy
me finish my studies for my career through many hardship and difficulties ai industry you can finally study yourself with our help
i would be crazy if ai have asian parent insult
i feel humanity will become so siloed from social contact by technology in future that inperson social gatherings will need to come full circle again as a quirky retro and cool trend
unfortunately gpt is often wrong for example when im querying on microtonal music theory and im sure it will occasionally give an incorrect answer in a friendly polite conversational and confident tone
dayum face with open mouth
sal khan im such a big fan of you keep doing what you do
could it also solve wife problems
wow this is amazing
school at home red heart
the students will miss bugging the classes face with tears of joy
bro who needs school now
lol khan checking if hes losing his job face with tears of joy
dont worry khan nothing with ever beat your khan academy legacy
calling your son the name of an evil af corporation interesting
this is going to make humans stupid
ai is the image of the beast of revelation get right with jesus christ
the student can not identify hypotenuse but knows the formula for sine is it normal
no matter how advance ai will never match human level of intelligence backstory i lost my job to ai
i owe my whole education that khan academy
rip universities and colleges red heart
hey i have read about this thing in brave new world its that book the little girl posses right
incredible i might homeschool my kids now and finally pull away from all that hard liberal bs thats being forced on our youth
one like gaurav sir who taught us about it
allowing every kid to have an ai tutor should be a priority it will help boost education so much
try giving a wrong answer smiling face with sunglasses
when you finally finish school by work hard all by yourself
uo khan
why learn math ai can do it better than you now grinning face with big eyes
chat gpt is the greatest invention since the internet
this is fucking wild
then men made the machine and for a time it was good
now your girlfriend can teach you too
we are so living in those scifi movies we used to watch in the s
its better than the math teacher at my school face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat
where is the macos app
new dlc
woah i forgot he was speaking to an ai halfway through the lesson face with open mouth
this will help me learn but what job will i have in the future is it worth it
i also have to say that to be the tutor for others has an huge impact of understanding a topic so after understanding the topic through ai he could deepen his understanding by explaining to others
rip teachers job tooo face with open mouth
why use ai to learn a skill you wont need because of ai
exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head
the ai voice sounds a lot like the one in the movie oblivion the doom is near rolling on the floor laughing
this might make up for the lack of teachers in some countries
i wish my math teacher was as nice as her
how to do parental control that the kid cant get the answer directly without parents permit
at it seemed to mispronounce deduction as deducsun as if it had a speech impediment it is surprising and could be an overcorrection to make it sound more human
that tsk at the beginning lmao tsk id be happy to help bruh shes gonna kill them
its weird that he knows the formula for some but doesnt know about the sides of a triangle
sal khans kid is already his kid is pretending that he doesnt know a hypothenuse just for the skit
who came here after dr gaurav girg sir current affairs video of th may
eat where
why did they pick such an easy problem at least pick an imo problem
wat app is this
will need lots of improvement its too slow and doesnt take charge like a teacher would i guess this is a demo
mark my words this is biggest revolution in education
if ai can teach the children why children need still to learn
they seem to be using new ios app that lets them interrupt the ai when is that coming
id love to learn programming with this
oh
bro this would bring a lot racial war
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians red heart red heart i am italian party popper
proud for coming kids to have free help at home and anywhere
more canadian wildfires spontaneously combusted for this tutorial
year old learning the right angle it is staged
as a human i am speechless
i have already received the notice to download the desktop app but bad news for some like me the app is only compatible with macos and apple silicon m or better there is no version for intel thumbs down thumbs down
and worth every single pennies
i am sending this to my friend who is a math teacher you are losing your job buddy
did anybody else pick up on how the new voice in the presentation sounded a lot like scarjo from her face with tears of joy and that they exclusively used apple products on stage smirking face
now i can finally get a mathematics degree in my university
nobody can replace the experienced teacher bond we share with teacher is so strong nodobut this will supplement the student in study
this ai is cooking
here goes the math teacher teacher jobs the next few years will be crazy either you learn robotics cybersecurity and ai or else you will struggle to be employed face with open mouth
sell the ai model i want to run it but on my device locally yeah no internet connection and no sharing of my data pleading face
finally no more bossy and lazy teachers that just give assignments
thanks sal for teaching me calculus
sal looks like an unemployed one here just kidding huge respect for sal
excellent unbeleivable out of the box
shouldve explained what hypotenuse was and how it means hanging under because it hangs under the right angle and how opposite refers to opposite of the angle and it shouldve explained adjacent means next to and touching but not the high button button amazing im sure it will do better soonwhen it comes to explaining
all the math the kids will learn will really help them when they enter the job marnever mind
private tutors after this chart decreasing chart decreasing chart decreasing
a lot of things will diey in next days rip
i mean this is what wolfram alpha already does
being khans son i imagine he is already able to do calculus in real life slightly smiling face
that smile at the end from sal tho hes proud of his son loudly crying face
i could use a tutor like that ai i dont know trig but now i know how to do that sincx
this is an absolute game changer but it clearly will create huge problems too think about how autocorrect has made peoples spelling worse now think what will the effect be on peoples reasoning if they can just get the answer immediately without having to work for it
next question would be why we should learn something that ai could do better than us
omg its real time and the voice is so freaking human
me hi chatgpt are you able to cure ageing gpt hello there yes i am perfectly able to cure ageing me that s great what is the cure gpt i am sorry i am not able to help you with that me not able or don t want to help me gpt either way me explodinghead gpt chad face
i dont think this will work for higher level problems taught in college like in computer system architecture etc
it didnt finish what about sine inverse of the fraction
by dr gaurav garg
rich indians
its worth noting that the kid is acting like he doesnt know math he clearly looks like he knows exactly whats going on
damn i can already see the benefits and the nonbenefits from this
bruh is that old and doesnt know what the hypotenuse is yep this generation is doomed
do tell the answer that am the point as well most efficient om
as a parent this is a legit game changer the us educational system is terrible and after the pandemic there is a severe shortage of teachers parents tried to compensate by hiring tutors but the rates are crazy in my area decent tutors are over hr if you can even find one i try to help when i can but as a working parent time is scare if ai can really help with something like this its an incredible contribution to society
rip coaching centres
folded hands
just memorize sinodhyp cosadhyp and tangopad
we need this for sure
tuition companies are sweating face with tears of joy
not much accurate
wow i can see indias schooling policy adapting to aibased teaching this will definitely solve the issues related to insufficient teaching staff infrastructure and facilities faced by government schools in not so distant future amazing time ahead
google ai team overall this is benefit to overall humanity
cant wait for open ai to make all the creators jobs obsolete too rolling on the floor laughing
not only has ai the potential to be far better than the average teacher but it also has the potential for free personalized education tailored for the needs strengths and weakenesses of every student and you wont have to get a new teacher every semester iy can follow your progress from learning multiplication tables all the way to multivariate calculus it can do all this h a day no matter your financial situation your geographical location and will never retire its a massive win for humanity given time it might even be as disrupting to education as the printing press
you look lonely i can fix that typa vibes
literally amazing
after eating up tuition teachers jobs mr khan is here to take it up to the next level
i wonder how this would deal with advanced calculus instead of simple trig
asian dad at kitchen table at pm mode would go absolute crazy
why teach anyone geometry when the ai can solve all the math and geometry problems for you
imagine ai teaching you in front of your dad and you miss it grinning squinting face
thats awesome i think its going to finish gemini
incredible
you may not understand the meaning of this yet but trust me this will me something you remember its going to be that important
is this the end of khan academy face with tears of joy
the ai is much more stupid than you think and isnt going to help for specific questions despite all the optimists here a machine learning model struggles hugely with questions being open ended without a repository of math solutions to base its search off of presented in a new different format very contextualised for math majors this is pretty darn useless although its a breakthrough for introducing people to areas of math for sure a massive problem i see is ai s tendency to be confidently wrong which might just confuse a beginner more than help also it gets distracted by what you ask and might not solve for the fastest path of explanation tl dr ideal for intro courses rubbish for practical use
gpto should give the other person more time to express their thoughts not every student can immediately give a fully formulated answer
i havent experimented with this yet but chances are that this is a great helper for students when it comes to practicing examples or explaining a particular topic but it is not a replacement for human teachers who build curriculums and tailor curated learning paths
good start albeit this is a basic problem that can barely be called math but i learned to never underestimate ai
how did they screw share in the ipad for gpt to view it
do you mean maths
ask chatgpt if it can shave that kids unibrow
if its good enough for khan its good enough for me nerd face very cool openai
this is insane
lol this is the real live demo of the hollywood acting demo from google
amen
give him jee advanced questions then see your gpt
rip schools
byjus destroyed itself before this cameout
goodness me
how about the guys who are making the hologram technologies we need you now
now do integration by substitution or some permutations and combinations
im watching this video on the recommendation of dr gaurav garg sir smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
holy unibrow
crying face face with tears of joy red heart
gg for tuition companies
dr gaurav garg sir send me here red heart
what would happen if they sell these data to rd parties just one time boom everything will be gone these need a lot of security mechanisms just think for now from just studying the way we are tapping screen moving mouse point and typing on a keyboard companies send advertisment more accurately they read out mind from just using that if this much of data went out thats it
lol everyone else who uses this will be like i got this math problem tell me the answer as quickly as you can as i have more problems for you to solve rip human intelligence were all going to slowly get dumber this way
now all that remains is to create a robot with this model so that it can work for me and bring in money face with tears of joy
i didnt know a robot voice needed to take breaths so are they just pretending its an ai voice but really a human or is it actually ai and they added breath noise for added realism i hate how its getting impossible to tell whats real and whats fake if they can create realistic voices and video how can you trust anything on the news anymore
how was the triangle and drawing done are those separate windows one of a drawing app and one of chatgpt
kid actually can you give me the answer directly ai sure id be happy to help sinalpha would equal would you like me to solve the rest of this document
i wish i was high on potenuse
bye tutors
why do you have ads on your channel
its that google io demo all over again but this time it might actually be used irl
google has work to do to catch you up face with tears of joy
human teacher for what work for it vacation for the rest of your life and who pays the bills open ai
and it just happened education is no longer a luxury my kids will never go to university and waste their life and money
i am become sentience destroyer of jobs
it would be better if you could give session with ai when student makes mistakes an ai try to correct him
is this another fake like when actual people were speaking offstage at other ai rollouts when will we find out grinning face with sweat
this kinds of technology requires pelicantheory is peoples blind in america already how many teachers and tutors get employed in this particular session of tutoring ai people smart but fallen branch into a raging river because theyre skipping the prerequisites balance scale they should give in order to adjust the side effects that arise from such geniusness
i look forward to this technology is amazing
rip tutors
rip all tutors
exciting but centred on individualistic thinking with no consideration that society hasnt been able to prepare what it will do to the collective society what will schools do and parents react when millions leave education for the to tutoring but lose the ability to relate to others
why is it condescending though grinning face with sweat still impressive
wow it can do simple middle school trig
bros named enron he has a chance of trying to hide a mess under his bed when his parents tell him to clean his room
why to teach kids if every work will be done by ai
exquisite ok hand
rip private tutors
very scripted on the human side of things also people who are learning something dont naturally think aloud such organized thoughts about what they are doing thats more of a teaching strategy than something people do when theyre learning
this is mindblowing
you know what there is no fear of beating from teachers if you do wrong calculation or move thanks buddy
there goes my tutoring gigs
why do we need this so we can cut down interaction between human i dont like where this technology is heading but cant stop it
this is wonderful sal openai a brighter future
played around w o and it seems to hallucinate a lot more than
this is concerning
im concerned if sal khans son actually doesnt know what a hypotenuse is or theyre doing it for the video edit grammar
that tsck was personally sarcastic man
thank god i know how to farm
well teachers are obsolete now
any of you guys seen that i gaslighted ai into saying video face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
nah this is crazy
please dont train your ais to act so phony
rip rabbit r
a great use case would be to see how it teaches the difference between parallelism and concurrency
dad has no freakin clue whats going on here face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
damn were not going to need professors anymorethis is scary
great deduckssin lol
not khan asking his son to make mistakes on purpose lmao
the most terrifying moment was at the end at minutes when the voice praised him she said great job etc and they immediately felt happy and acknowledged they showed by instinct real human emotional responses to a programmed unreal thing i am not sure we understand this aspect well enough robots can or will make use feel in a certain way even when we know whats going on it can really help lonely people and yet making them lonelier then before
rip the teacher of math
i can feel khans disappointment on seeing that his son doesnt know what the hypotenuse is lol
everybody the future is now
man were going to die pretty soon sigh
but honestly no one is gonna use this as a tutor they will use it to get all the answers instead face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
bye bye indian edtech industry
math tutors have left the chat
i want to believe that all this will soon become available to everyone and our children will listen to the stories of veterans who learned everything themselves without anyones help red heart
this isglorious yall are making history and the future thank you
this is miles better than your average teacher or learning in a classroom still its not better than being taught one on one by a really good teacher because the ai would not be able to reliably answer any tangential doubts you may have or if youre curious to know more about something for example you might want to know why trigonometry was created in the first place who created it how its applicable in real life and any further doubts you may have regarding that because the ai cant grasp the human element behind creation of these concepts but i am positive that it will reach this level in the next couple of decades or less given the astounding rate of development that weve seen since the past couple of years
idk why this feels so dystopian maybe because its so impersonal
its the beginning of the end i saw the matrix recently and this video really doesnt help the case loudly crying face
when will this feature be available
sal is one of the person i admire the most
the thing is kids wont ask for homework help theyll ask for answers
really looks this is heavily staged like the who really underlines six times his answere in order to make sure the model get it right
i wish i was high on potenus
remember when the movie her was a sci fi movie years ago good times
the new features certainly help but ive already been using gpt was pretty bad in comparison heavily instead of tutors or secondary literature that may or may not contain what you want to know for almost a year now its been so helpful that i wonder how things wouldve gone without i probably wouldve still passed my classes but i wouldnt have understood nearly as much
really awesome
goodbye school teachers
what is the turkish comment you are looking for here
is this bye bye job for teachers and tutors
clown face that boy doesnt know hypotenuse seriously

if i had this technology years ago my parents would be so proud face with tears of joy
i love the video but i cant help thinking hello ai can you teach our children a skillset that will be made obsolete by your own advancements in just a few years
now help me with integration
waiting for the scarlet johansen voice module
pandit badri prasad har har bhole
bye bye teachers

incredible feat
where are super cooked
rip the math tutoring business
the ai forgot to use the inverse function of sine yo calculate the angle still not very advances hope it will in the future
this can do by th class students in india face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
rip government teachers around the globe why have a teacher in a room of or more and hold up the class for the bottom few not understanding something i remember in my first year of college my math class having maybe students and some girl couldnt understand that and were the same variant from we spent over minutes out of our time on this one problem its like homeschooling for all advance at your own pace and leave the slow kids behind teachers are baby sitters and they are obsolete they will only be with the special needs kids at the government schools soon
skull
im pretty worried
he has an eyebrow
remarkable it sounds like ure almost talking to a human being
i cant wait to have ai friends tbh

what are they feeding these computers and when can i have it
gg sir full moon face

tutoring will be gone completely
ngl i cant wait for the apocalypse
bruh elon will be very angry after watching this
unbelievable
holy moly
crazy to think that my kid when it goes to school in two years will live with ai day by day its spooky
how to get access to gpto
ai can not teach maths like indian jee teacher like mohit tyagi
omg we are living in the future
bro thats very easy youre complicating it just remember one line pandit badhri prasad har har bole sona chandi tole this line get me through my high school
and now that youve learned basic trigonometry lets proceed to make your career choices obsolete
if there was one thing that this video did for me then it was showing me how horrible ipados is you cant even have such an app as a interactive widget or smart assistant you have to use non customizable split screen
this is basically the simplest math problem in the world with a fancy chat bot
khan really agreed to promote the product that inevitably will take his job
this is kind of crazy
thats some pretty impressive tts
it was artists now it is rip teachers
face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
openai taking your jobs one at a time
this will give back so much time to parents more time for us enjoying our free time face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i am filled with so much wonder and existential dread this isnt just software its mass producible intelligence
do we really need teachers at this point
this will revolutionise schools
but the problem is how to import the problem into it
i found my new universal professor
insane to think that the new generation will not know the feeling of tears falling onto your notebook the night before the exam
salute to this man saluting face
ai gasping for air while conversing significantly at was it a feature to pass turing test
damn the way chatgpt is talking is totally human even i heard her taking a deep breath while conversating this is damn awsome
thats crazy
liked the way ai offered encouragement and praise alongside in the right way
i like how he used red color for wrong answers and blue for correct ones xd
open ai is great we are freinds
lol whats the point even if ai is going to take everyones jobs this announce series is crazy
my fucking god we are fucked
that thing can breath ai s weakness is finally revealed just cut the air supply and humanity s saved d
i love how indian startups are going to get affected with this because i dont like how much they much on entrance exams and not push on the idea developing children to really understand what they like or not
they should test what kids are actually gonna be asking explain this trig problem in terms of skibidi toilet type shit
if this guy hadnt specifically told it not to it would have just given the answers right away and the kid wouldnt have learned anything
the parents are so useless the ai has to come in and help face with tears of joy
schooling is going to change drastically
feeling like watching actor acting
tutors are cooked face with tears of joy
bye bye math teachers
it cant solve jee problems lmfaooooo
hlw gpto please make it free for middle class family like us slightly smiling face
theyre using a lot of apple products in these demos wonder why
the father seems pretty convinced and impressed too xd wish i had this when i was a kid
drake smiling in the corner kendrick must be fuming after seeing this face with tears of joy

gourav sir ne shikha real me bhut realistic voice thumbs up thumbs up
this is great but people are forgetting that of american kids are addicted to tiktok youtube instagram the modern day problem is now discipline actually doing the work which most people cant do there will always be a way to differentiate the a kids from the c kids
feeling no stress about learning is the best part of this technology
we are so duck duck mobile phone off grinning face with sweat crying face face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
im quitting my cs master study and starting a career in mcdonalds
gaurav sir has sent it brother smiling face with open hands
we have created a monster only it doesnt know what it is yet
oh my god
were doomed its no longer in years time its in next years time we could be doing loudly crying face
teachers are cooked
this is paradigm shifting we all know that socioeconomic status plays a large role in quality of education often students from poorer families receive less opportunities to succeed when compared to the more welloff community this allows students from less advantageous backgrounds to get an onthego tutor that can understand their flaws and provide meaningful guidance in subjects they struggle with for incredibly cheap relatively speaking this elevates such children in a significant manner that will help them bridge one of the gaps in their educational potential unfreakinreal
all private tutors should start sending their cvs to mcdonalds
first we train them and then they train us lets see whos going to do it better and what the result will be smiling face with smiling eyes
it was having a conversation with another ai before you interrupted it and now its going to take tutor jobs
we wont have this in europe because of ai act hopefully this will be solved in the next months
we got khan academy ray romano before gta loudly crying face
imagine what itll be like in years id imagine someone will comment something under this in years
me on the right who doesnt have to tutor his brother on the left anymore
just as tiktok reduced our attention span there will now be a generation of kids that will start talking over one another without patience hearing politicians speak over one another is painful enough openai please change this behavior in your model before it becomes a common practice
kota byjus tough time grinning face with sweat
this is crazy
if you are upgrading gpt this much shouldnt you consider to update gpt little bit simultaneously face with spiral eyes
hey sam altmanyou do your best to provide education to worldthankyou for your such efforts red heart red heart red heart

she is better than my mom when she teaches me ogre ogre
i am happy for the new generation this tool will change the world in the long term as sam altman said we will get better and high quality education now for everbody it means less crime and less war for the future
meanwhile chatgpt cant sum some numbers edit for all who wounder gpt can do sum my numbers i tried
the voice and how its saying stuff sounds like a mix of the portal voice and a vault tec commercial from fallout
this is bad for the world in years imagine all the issues this causes to the world technology will kill humanity
teachers are going to be out of a job very soon
jesus this is going to groundbreaking
dr gaurav garg sir recommended this video love you gesture
cortana is here d
imagine advertising the sole thing that could overtake your career and make your job obsolete repect khan academy fr
no way
i think this chatgpt will replace all teachers from school to college smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
who came here after gautam girg sirs suggestion to watch the video grinning face with smiling eyes
what is the app that they are using for drawing
gaurav sir has sent
ai is still just scary shit to me
so you guys are advertising that ai can teach you what hypotenuse is in minutes good job lololol
can we get all senior executives to train gpt this way we can replace it
bye teachers professors doctors anyone making a living in information or education
can this boy read a book
humane pin but realllll
how would you even set gpt up to work like this on an ipad like the whole split screen thing
imagine such ai in a video game
khan gonna be out of a job man
good work now be so kind to establish a skynet corporation for me please
who else is here after gaurav sirs recommendations
love to see sal smiling face with heart eyes
this is such a huge paradigm shift for education for science for humanity red heart party popper
bro its still unable to solve basic questions of jee face with tears of joy
the way the voice works is really great
this is just game changing few more videos to go i have to watch the rest imagine this paired with games smiling face with heart eyes

this was amaaaaaaazing face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth i just vant believe this shit is happening face with open mouth
well poor boy and good luck teaching nigerias children this way no way
great deducson
its not published yet is it i cant find the function in the ipad app and im a plus user eyes
i really hope we dont need to wait months for this lets just start releasing it out asap
sid the ai just tch at
openai copied rabbit r and the rabbit doesnt need a scamming subscription
if everybody uses this for education there is a chance for many many people to lose their jobs in schools and other educational government stuff but openais technology is really impressive and shocking
i wonder if you can tell it to respond in a shorter manner without all the politenessetc
can the general public try this today for free
i would suck at maths if it werent for sal khan i owe him so much
on the other hand i think its going to become increasingly difficult to create an ai with a flop like doraemon
remember guys they faked the sora demo
requiring human interaction of any kind is becoming obsolete
ai was inevitable as a parent who has struggled with finding professional tutors who actually cared about teaching i understand appreciate and is thankful for ai technology khan academy was average his videos were dry monotonous and not engaging for majority of students khan realizes a potential threat rightfully so emotions aside knowledge is open source for everyone convenient affordable tutoring at your disposable
guys we are facing with future education right now
wowowwow
sorry but you close if you got chance of guessing the right side
rip teachers
just teach sohcahtoa chatgpt that is all
gpt can do that too make it tutor something like polynomial division gpt manages to always mess it up
thanks gaurav sir
ngl i expected khanacademys son to be doing indefinite integrations at this point face with tears of joy
id love to see it tutor a problem in more advanced maths and without it knowing the problem beforehand ie you describe the problem or write it down theb proceed
this is fucking nuts
your son nimrod
rip to teaching job
i think hes going to explode trying to help me with my prep school physics class
i love khan
kid blinks in morse code
bye teachers please know you were useless during this time waving hand
khan was getting sus when she said purrfect
come on guys this is not the real use case percent of the students will just ask what the solution of the problem is thats it face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
my mind just exploded
now chatgpt will be islam
is it publicly available when can we test it
this will revolutionize the prn and sxbot industry my gud
so ai gonna teach our kids now
were fckd
why do you need to learn anything anymore
the fakest conversation ever skull
wow now teach me residue theorem
kid is cute as hell red heart red heart
the problem isnt that people are going to lose their jobs the problem is kids are going to think ai cant be wrong or have limited information at the moment its being used
i used to teach struggling kids and make money now its all over
could you please take over the world a bit slower so that i can adapt
still requires supervising face with tears of joy lately it learned something human
awesome technology
robert is unleashing the future harnessing the unparalleled power of gpto hes creating revolutionary voice and visionenabled smart agents that will reshape the very fabric of our existence a world where intelligent automation transforms every aspect of life and work abt
i am excited to see gpto help us to solve jee advanced question
this the kind of stuff youd see in the early s disney futuristic shows and movies face with tears of joy
you might think teachers are going to be out of a job however if ai can teach humans better than most humans can then that will be beneficial to humanity there are many complex subjects for where there are only a few expert teachers in the world who are eloquent enough to explain the subject matter in a comprehensive way through ai like this we will now all have access to such teachers in abundance
pretty cool how it uses a voice intonation geared towards a young learner
now adays i spend my time correcting chat gpt it makes mistake alot so i started scolding it now i dont use it
it sounds like teacher before taking students doubts
wow just wow
insane exploding head
this is probably the best case scenario got to try it in real life and not believe ad from company ai can be completely wrong about stuff too i been using copilot ai and it can save a lot of time vs google searching since it can pull relevant data from multiple sites at once and output it in a natural human language the issue is that it can get stuff so wrong
me playing the video through multiple times to try and spot any imperfections in the video i cant help but think that this whole video is aigenerated
were living in the future now fire
traditional education will be destroyed in a few years because of this and thats a good thing the cost of education has always been a bottleneck
now all those ai interpretation in video games and novels are becoming true i dont know man its just weird to think about it
how about make the voice less obviously annoying
too bad my final for calc is over
so cool
goodbye teachers what about collecting recyclables in the streets its a better profession
yeah were done the movie her from is real now
come from gaurav garg sir
suggested by gaurav garg sir to watch it really loved to see how it works red heart
rip jobs
will be the first to comment that this technology will not be applicable like video shown until at least years in the futute hope to be proven wrong but ai right now is just getting delusional by questions and prompts way too quickly from my experience
time to enter the dune timeline
wakanda school principal it seems cheaper to subscribe to a i than the salary of an honorary teacher cryingface
can you show something that isnt basic trig maybe something with a proof of graph theory would actually be helpful
lol they choose the easiest problem as the demo face with tears of joy face with tears of joy i like how the kid purposely tries to get the hypotenuse wrong
more on rip college
bye bye private tutors
great acting
khan face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
better than a school teacher
this is going to be an amazing aid for children especially when youre not understanding a subject and the parent is getting frustrated by the child this will save a lot of yelling lol
ill be impressed when it can teach and solve algebra calculus and differential equations
better than any teacher i ever had in any public school which gpt has just rendered obsolete
whether it can solve the integral
finally we can get rid off asian parent teaching but also yelling how could you be so stupid at you at the same time
ok now i am sure they are working with apple
sals investment in chat gpt was great move
how to make chat gpt see something
no jobs are safe
wow i actually thought the women speaking was a real women doing tutor job in openai this is crazy but imagine how in future jobs will be gone maybe
i believe wolfram alpha has been doing this since
this feature hasnt rolled out yet right
yeah i think no body would ask this level of difficulty its too damn difficult
but the ai is doing sals job why is he helping it
here after dr gaurav garg sirs current affair video lecture
this is so cool and scary at the same time
imran khan is fun to say
in these math demos gpto teaches textbook style instead of guiding the student to understand math more intuitively
i just want to thank sal khan from the bottom of my heart for his academy i keep fond memories of all the math and geometry lessons i watched there years ago that helped me relearn what i had long forgotten so i could be able to help out my daughter with her homework and all for free in a world of greed and ignorance this man is a precious gift
thats a proof of concept really more than anything impressive the problem should at least have steps
wow impressive
rip dad math tutors coffin can you teach my son math but make him cry before solving the problem
i have a gpt subscription but how do i get this back and forth without having to manually press record
thats so incredible the way chat gpt sounds like a real person tutor and it does an excellent job explaining math problems how did they train a model like this its beyond my wildest dream for sure this definitely gives an end to the math tutor side job for students to begin with and i wonder whats the next incredible thing that ai can do
rip high school teacher jobs crying face
this is amazing now about he atomic bomb lets start with where i can get plutoniumoh btw can you keep this between us
is this app available yet i dont see the option to draw like this in the chat gpt app
you need to get a kid who really needs help and not someone who is pretending they dont get it but its still amazing what it can do
rip highschool rip college xd
this really killed my teams tech startup idea
me showing my teacher this to prove my phone is smarter than him
its over for us
end to personal tutoring business
this ai is gonna put khan academy out of business brooo pensive face loudly crying face loudly crying face
goodbye school
finally i can have a patient teacher that wont hit me out of frustration and shout profanities at me
rip to the teachers and professors the world is slowly turning into detroit become human
the past years have shown me education as i knew it growing up is basically finished now its a great way to meet people but why listen to a year old professor when you can speak to ai
i for one welcome this age of self learning and critical thinking finally books and knowledge will become available like never before
this is perfect this model came out right as i am about to start studying for the mcat and take physics over summer
didnt expect to see khan here face with tears of joy
this is whats getting baked into ipados natively
i am ready to see the world where all kids have this but i am also expecting we are in for some nasty surprises with the average intellect going up too fast for the world to adapt
my child gose to ai school
i like the fact that when its talking if you start speaking it stops and waits for your response google assistant never did that lol
right after the dang ap calculus exam test skull skull skull skull thats so foul loudly crying face
math tutoring is almost exclusively what i use ai for i just really enjoy math and am super excited and this update
imran is goated fr
rockmanexe coming real i wish i was born years later

how is the bot registering his pen movements is it from a third person view camera or reading the screen internally
mind blowing
overhyped this thing is still wip
now this is ai for good
cringeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
this is actually a historical turn we are witnessing right now i can already imagine this evolving into something as large and intelligent as the fictional jarvis and friday this combined with the ability to interact with the physical world and make real world decisions with all the information of world its history its past every scientific knowledge and research in its head accessible in a second its gonna be an engineering marvel
this is so nice its very hard to find teaher in india and maths is so hard to teach my son always ask question and i dont have answer to it this will help so much thank u for this
me immediately i saw this sohcahtoa god bless my teacher
when your gpu becomes your teacher
pleading face smiling face with tear
we want this kind of learning and studying by our own and a genius helper not just lecturing us and make our mind sleepy
holy shit face with open mouth grinning face with sweat
real life tutors exist you know my math tutor in high school was legally blind and rode a bicycle to meet me at the library he was also a professional black jack player
there are approx math tutors currently employed in the us earning per hour those jobs just evaporated big round of applause sam altman
gotta give an oscar to this lad
im sceptic that this is real but if it is face with open mouth
wish ai was there in my uni days
teachers think this is going to help them no this is going to replace them
great work of all participants great work of openai this has got a power to change the world entirely how we have known it to these days fantastic work and results thumbs up ok hand clapping hands
chat gpt is growing faster than the scifi authors told us the ai would be
holy hype this is amazing
learning is going to be so much easy and so much fun with ai its epic times we live in smiling face with heart eyes smiling face with heart eyes
desperately want to point out that his sons name is imran khan
for thousands of years reason and calculation have been a distinctive feature of humanity and at the beginning of the twentyfirst century artificial intelligence came to demand it from us what will the next millennia bring us
sal khan is still my favorite online tutor
not even close to my tutoring skills
skynet is improving so fast
its really waw
such a shit problem bro we here in india learn this in th grade lmao
interesting now please let us see the behavior of the ai with an intransigent student who persistently complains that they dont know and that they cant do it
weed son
youre making it way too easy for the ai i would like to know how good it is in a real world scenario not one where everything is so carefully planned
rip teacher occupation
as a teacher im so glad i plan on leaving teaching because this is better than at least of the teachers i know
i get the feeling it takes video in at a very slow frame rate like maybe one frame every two or three seconds thats why the kid held his pen over the sides for a very long time drawing upanddown repeatedly to make sure it saw it im still super impressed though and obviously this will keep getting better
good luck teachers in profession rolling on the floor laughing
the intonations are as intimidating as my math teachers
what kind of sorcery is this
university m gpt free why do i need to go again grinning face with sweat
this is unbelievable congrats
chatgpt will teach kids wrong math with full confidence
those new gpus are witchcraft i swear face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
yeah as a mathematician i can tell you that there is a point where this ia cant even begin or start a true high level abstract complex math probleme and itll be cringe to see
i wonder how long until it becomes annoying we know its a nonrobotic robot voice face with tears of joy
this is excellent tool for far flung remote areas where education rate is very low we could have more engineers scientist doctors and so on awesome tool love it red heart

how can we get it
future is only imagination until someone builds it hats off to you open ai what a time to be alive
came in with my expectations being zeronow im leaving in shock astonished face
wow face with open mouth
can i use this to teach me how to draw
wish i had this crying face
i asked chat gpt what is the lcm of and it literally said face with tears of joy
omg that was the toughest question humanity has ever seen clinking beer mugs
the moment the kid started stressing out
its weird how human it sounds
it speaks and explains a thousand times better than my teachers face with spiral eyes
the ai talks more like a human than a human himself
here is are three new words for teachers redundant superfluous andunemployed
what is the app theyre using that allows this interaction like chatgpt the math app
i would love something a bit less polite like my latino teachers i told him that the hypotenuse was this what a bastard smilingfacewithtear
what will teachers and tutors do now its exciting but also very concerning
sounds like dora the explorer
why is study not happening
if i was a kid i would trade my old hag boring math teacher with this perky ai teacher and only go to class to socialize face with tears of joy
we all know khans sons already writing his phd thesis for mathematics and is just pretending to not know the sides of a triangle for us dumbdumbs
this video is like a window in the future i can see ai teaching our kids one day awsome job as usual from openai
i think god smiles upon humanitys inventive spirit and is thrilled with our groundbreaking achievements
this is freaking amazing o
tell ironman that jarvis can pack his bags
khan good platform you have
my god this shit is going to revolutionize the world
i wonder why they didnt try to have it evaluate the arc sine oh wait
okay now do multiplication and division in the kitchen of course trying to help them figure out without shouting how many times can you fit into literally impossible or at least my father would say
did they hire the same marketing team that google did when they annonced gemeni
its amazing that while others are afraid of being left behind khan is always pushing forward with the latest technology to make learning better and more accessible for everyone amazing job imran sal and gpto grinning face with big eyes
face with open mouth theres another profession on the wires grinning face with sweat bye bye tutors flushed face
khans son forced to tell wrong answer so that they can show us how gpt will guide him to correct answer face with tears of joy
the thing we wish we had years ago
it sounds like real life dora
the real question are you on onlymaths facewithtearsofjoy
inb they ask ai for the nuclear launch codes
when i was a kid all i had was a couple of sets of outdated and incomplete encyclopedias
lets keep this unknown im a math tutor
technology continues to make things slower and inefficient it will increase accessibility hopefully silver lining
chatgpt wont be able to touch jee advanced questions face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
how i can do that
the intonation is crazy
you are close there are just three sides face with tears of joy
i have come here on the advice of gaurav sir
rip teachers neutral face
i thought the guy on the right was learning too but then i realized who it was
even the voice damn
remember skynet its close its very close
new ai funna make me act up better chill with that tone
yall specifically invited him to tell your job is over loudly crying face
its good to see gpt o being helpful for students if the students are trying to do their homework on their own
good teacher i mean gpto face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
aint no way its this fast
the ai sounds like it had just tutor kids in a row cant catch a break
id better plan for an early retirement packing before the age of ill be out of a job upside down face im currently a maths tutor
hi gwmebiooen ai bante
there is no ai smart enough to teach me math
heres a plot twist when ai becomes this intelligent in mainstream use learning math will be stupid human do not need to spend time anymore learning anything in math that is not adding and substrancting
the beginning of the end of chegg
petition to make ai music generator
soon i say goodbye to my grumpy old college teacher and replace it with this ai that dont have to scream at me each time i get the answer wrong and instead guides me to the right answer
i am in shock at the possibilities this presents for humanity and imagine if we could fit all this into a gadget without servers an autonomous mass product with all the knowledge history and technology for all time whatever happens to humanity this knowledge would not be lost people would be able after any disaster and wheat to grow and grind it and bake bread instantly get any blueprint for a building and the necessary infrastructure i dream that it would be autonomous without a centralized server pray develop processors and memory flushed face
didnt know who that was until he opened his mouth then it was clear
it can talk
skynet is coming face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
kid be like i dont know which one is the hypotenuse but im sure that the formula for sin is oh
incredible there are no words
this is nuts
we all know that sal was cursing gpt in his mind for stealing his job face with tears of joy
this is wild this means every kid can have a personal tutor who is infinitely patient and guides them in exactly the way they need at any time day or night that is such a gamechanger and finally gives everyone access to the highest quality education regardless of social status exploding head
now can you imagine what ai will do in years either we will be slave or go extinct
dr gaurav garg has sent it to me
lets close the academies haha
maths tutors see what is happening face with open mouth
how do we access
khangpt the future of education red heart
ai will never replace teachers hahahahhahahahaaaahhahahahahbaahhahahahahahahahahahajajajajajahhahahhahahabaha
is that scarlett johansson
wish i had that when i was in schoolcollege loudly crying face
this ai sounds more human than actually human himself
and yet people are commenting such a shame it cannot solve laplace equation
no teacher will sleep tonight
genz millenial parents are still feeling helpless after all this help
the ai with the female voice already has an attitude because she got cut off damn that shit is realistic rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
young djokovic doing side quests
may i also be invited to try this id love to and can think of many things to do with it and ways to test it and push it further
cant believe you guys made a better sounding better version of the google assistant in a few years and google couldnt do anything for the past years
is this available for normal plus users yet i havent been able to figure it out as of yet
well i am also using chatgpt for my studies it still has some flaws in mathematics and physics but still provides a path which is correct but the calculations most of the time is wrong but thats not even a problem its most helpful in chemistry like subjects helps to build concept if you do cross questions with it
who is gpto talking to at to and why is it talking at all
study iq
omg face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth am blown away so good and awesome
waiting for this almost half a decade now
well that seems madeup to me i cant believe this kid cannot find the hypothenus by himself and solve that ridiculously simple math problem that apart assuming nothing else is made up the interaction is interesting id prefer to see it do a real math problem tho
i am totally down with this application
im sorry i cant with the kids unibrow on the other hand as a math and comp sci major i cant wait for this to help me with my fourier analysis class
give some calculus then lets see
come from dr gaurav garg sir study iq
the future is truly here amazing
jee adv in danger
the schools need to reform this might be the school of the future
lol teachers gg
focus on engineering problem please the ai is very week in solving a little bit complicated maths
that is unbelievable
this will end so much abuse
this is craaazyyyy
jesus
imagine how effective this will be at teaching language
want to try jee advanced math problems
since this is free gpt learning from the biggest library in existence aka the internet has access to public college level stuff melinda gates foundation publicized college books for free on the internet meaning college is free yeah we just need to prove our skills through exams
bro that idddentifiiie at is craaaaazy obviously this entire video is insane but that one is just special
this is going to revolutionize the entire educational system
is it available in hinglish
its like having the teacher next to him somebody who is explaining the problemits not bad
your gpt is incapable of solving jee advance question face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
schools permanently out
does anyone know how they share screen with gpt thanks
as if this kid doesnt know which side is the hypotenuse face with tears of joy
ai will teach ai and skynet will be initiated
this is wild
of course indians
and i found why my kid are very weak in mathematics
mind blown
we need to see ai doing engineer maths calculus that could be real fun
can it be done with my engineering math problems
so in the other demo they copied code to have gpt explain it instead of screen sharing why
goodbye teachers
this is impressive but dont forget that llms make mistakes so it does work on this kind of easy problem but im not sure how it will handle more complicated challenges
whats a home tutor
de turks and jerbs
is it capable to do complicated problems
she exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen red heart red heart red heart
okay but when my kids do math they do a lot of uuuugggh and i dont want to do this and this is so stupid can it help with that
dawg i thought that was vikstar in the thumbnail
imagine being khans son and having to listen to your dad teach you everything all day everyday sheesh incredible demo too though
literally an ad for apple ipad pro rolling on the floor laughing
the real time response is really cool
can you describe the exact technical set up they are using what is running on the ipad id like to mimic it and test it with other problems
you brought sal from khan academyyyyyyyyy amazing
fire fire fire fire
how is this done how do you share the screen on the ipad
udemygpt
thats not bad very nice thats the future people accept it fire fire fire fire fire fire
wildly impressive
what program they are using to do the math
that is as cool as it is creepy honestly
what about khanmigo
i wish i had these shits in my high school
cant wait until i lose my job too
i remembered the scene from big bang theory wherein raj kothrapalli fancies siri i think a similiar trend might appear now ai girlfriend good for introverts and weirdoes
anyone noticed ai taking breathin during convo
i know khan offered some learning material to openai to train the model
why would we need to learn sin alpha when he grows up you wont need to know shit just get waited on by computers
why bother
if khan thinks thats good for his own son its more than good for the rest of us
i hate all of this
you are close your error was the maximum possible
is this a joke
omw to be the worst engineer of all time folded hands
the son is experiencing tics because he consciously knows that there is a camera observing him
i guess we can shift from a college fund for our kids to a trade school fund thatll probably not be replaced by ai
thank god now my son can do his homework on his own one job down for me waiting to lose my real job soon
oh how ill miss the late night dinner table tutoring with dad loudly crying face
how is this not agi where will the goal post shift now
skull and crossbones skull skull skull skull skull
exploding head
omfg the teacher will be fired
wow and its better than my teacher
tsk wtf that was smooth
its at least years too soon for this face with tears of joy
this service is free
gaurav sir has sent victory hand its genius
wow that would help me alot with my igcse maths
how can i access it i still see only gpt
the new model is not whats impressive what im impressed with is the image generation shown on their website it can literally generate d models and text perfectly its absolutely insane
i think this could do for teachers what online shopping and delivery has done for retail remove the abuse from the equation if this were implemented in such a way as to show exactly what a kid did and when there could be no deflected blame
wth wth wth wth
jarvis
chatgpts really said tsk in tbe beginning face with tears of joy
damn wish i had that back in the days when i went to school wouldve been a straight a student face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
great no need to go to school anymore
wow exploding head
living in a simulation now broskies face with tears of joy
those asians be like using artificial intelligence to learn pythagoras theorem it s overkill rollingonthefloorlaughing
imran to o in private how do i allahu akbar boomboom your data center as ai is haram
the teachers at the chomdu lol they were never of any use anyway
sohcahtoa
soon youll have to subscribe for teacher premium plan offers better premium teacher
the gpt is high on pot nose
this is the future
is the voice actually ai
holy crap that is insane
this is the most realistic way of communication by an ai until now i find
thumbs up
great red heart
face with open mouth
were all going to die
plot twist they were just on a phone call with a teacher
great
nah at this speed syllabus will not be completed
sal is testing technology that will soon replace him feels cruel
as an indian student of th grade i can surely say that finding sin of an angle in a triangle is the most basic thing we learn in trigonometry in th face with tears of joy
thats some serious prompt engineering from the dad anyone with kids knows that they wont recite that
how did he share the screen to chatgpto
sal khan is truly one of the greatest men of our time
the breathing
the great thing is ai will not replace janitors and fast food workers soon pick up your brooms and learn to stand in the kitchen for hours straight
we are actually so cooked
hey khan
but why is the kid not happy
just incredible to think we are in the baby stages of ai here this thing can very comfortably tutor for middle school and below maths problems and it sounds natural encouraging and intelligent imagine what we will have in years i think ai is going to take over most of our jobs a lot quicker than anybody is expecting assuming we are able to shift away from llms and into something more sophisticated ai has been mainly limited a lot by computation power and funding now that both of those hurdles are far lower than they used to be thanks to a recent ai boom nvidia going nuts in the ai market the developments made in the coming years will be awesome to see
woah i forgot he was speaking to an ai halfway through the lesson
was it about to complain that it couldn t see anything because of the blurriness facewithtearsofjoy this is insane dude
i feel a little sad today worried face i was training to be a tutor so i could make a few bucks finally crying face
rip all teachers from year olds to year olds
why voice assistant is unavailable now
bro were witnessing scifi in reality someone tell me that im dreaming loudly crying face
please permanently stop the development of all ai technology i beg you folded hands medium skin tone
what the hell does it say at fict cahs prekt
really indian teenager who prep for jee study too kuch indepth maths
i wonder why that kid is learning for a job thats going to ne obsolete go learn how to grow some vegetables kid they dont know it yet face with tears of joy
damn we are at continual inflection points so quickly it is hard to believe
ultron is coming next
so the new chatgpt os can intervention to the application on every device example on video they are using the ipad so how can i do that using the chatgpt to help resolve the math when im open the other application
every kid is going to just ask ai for the answer and learn absolutely nothing the villains at openai have done it again the big dumb is happening
wow this is unreal
rip tuition teachers
sal
whyy everything will be done by ai why you still need education face with tears of joy
she did not like the way he interupeted her that tsk face with tears of joy
years ago steve wozniak cofounder of apple had given a talk at a local university and during that talk he had predicted that education as a whole would eventually change from the tradition methods well folks i believe this is what he predicted
why i dont have all these video features on my chatgpt o ios app
now thats impressive
absolutely brilliant folded hands clapping hands i am a year male and i am going to teach myself math all over again as i flunked out at school very embarrassing and disheartening now i can just be me in my own time folded hands
what i actually think we arent going to use these things to learn but actually to get the job then like when everyone would have access to such smart ai why would they try to solve it they would actually make it do it i think we wont even have to copy these in notebook then because most of the work would in our laptop or smartphone
interacting with image data in conversational context this changes everything
plot twist the son and dad are ai
definitely scripted no way asian kid doesnt understand the topic right off the bat
i am going to learn maths again finally a worthy tutor
ima tell my kids sal told his to miss the hypotenuse at first on purpose
now this is the future for real even if gpto doesnt become the dominant voice tutor the fact an ai voice tutor exists means kids will be talking to them for homework assistancenot their parents or paid tutors
wow just wow felt like i just watched a magic trick
how is his son so tapped lol
that man made me survive my linear algebra class thanks khan
bro that tsk in the beginning is wild shes a savage
rip homework
welcome to her
gaurav garg came on sirs request smiling face with smiling eyes clapping hands
him staring hopelessly knowing he gonna lose his job to this ai face with tears of joy
at first i was crying being an indian kid for not knowing what are the opposite and adjacent but its just perpendicular and base loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face another american thing
obviously staged but i think still impressive
but will it blow me
in future high school will become obsolete no human teachers will be required we are trying so hard to replace our fellow human beings face without mouth
openai doing great job hundred points clapping hands
bill gates has the reason saying that ai will replace the teacher in years
the best use cases were this and be my eyes then again needs to have a test run on all the modules before being deployed to ensure safety the other use cases have no significant value add
khaaaaaaannnn face with open mouth
hello teachers
rip mr khan it was nice knowing you yours truly every dumb noob kids and adults
gpt actually in this form i cant well thats worrying
i just hope it will help me in solving physics numericals
we got free tutoring now this would be a huge help for students it would be nice if all students like me especially gcse students as it is exam season now can have early access to this technology to help with revision
bruh his sons face looks like they have been trying for last hours
gaurav sir
this has already replaced maths teachers if they introduce it to the school system one job taken down crying face
this will replace teachers no doubt
i hope it works the same when it is out of the videos
khan nice to see you
dang this is actually so cool and useful
the stuff they did to make it sound emotive makes it sound creepy
imagine this in years
i have gpto but i dont see those options in the video grinning face with sweat
i feel ready to face the toughest boss in life math
this is impressive
i would love to see it tackle more difficult problems like say integration or continuous probability etc
sick star struck
as we watch in may this is surely a game changer im really excited for the future as this will benefit kids more than we think
to be honest chat gpt is annoyingalways gave me wrong answereven a simple one and even when i gave it a correct formula and possible range of answerit still repeatedly gave me wrong answer while admiting its wrong loli wanna make it easy without repeating the question just changing the numbers etc huhuand thats not alleven when asking for simple question like size of a paper etc person getting massage light skin tone person getting massage light skin tone person getting massage light skin tone person getting massage light skin tone
this is the most impressive demo of chapgpt o new model vision
little bro knew the equation for sin of an angle but couldnt find the hypotenuse right
i am high on potenuse
this is the end of personal tutors
amazing work oai
awesome this feature need to upgrade to plus it is real time interaction on a split screen with drawing capabilities it this require specific software or application support beyond the typical capabilities of chatgpt may i know the software on this video they used thank you
what device does the guy use so that he can draw lines even in colours and ai reads his inputs
screen broadcast how does that work
it gives the answers so you can use deduction to find the rest of the problems this would not work form me
just imagine the language models in the next years holy moly
if only there was some way to convey information clearly and easily online and explain math without needing a robot that causes drought i think they used some archaic technique called reading in the old days soh cah toa there now you know trigonometry
here from study iq gaurav sir
can it also solve pdes and help me with boundary value problems
i asked chat gpt jee advance maths problems it answered only one question correctly face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
is this rip to tutors
what app is that
khan so cool
first problem how to fix a monobrow
this is absolutely awesome in every which way
we need a comprehensive gender course and tutoring form this ai math can wait
the voice glitching is so creepy literally ex machina now
how long would a session that long with gpt o cost
i wish i was high on potnuse
i think i like the first time ai before gtp o i was little bit not good at math now i am impressed really face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
how did they do this setup i know how to put it on a split screen but when i do chat says it can not see the other screen that is open
bro how someone tell me how we just got introduced to ai properly less than years ago
gaurav sir sent
i feel like theyve just given us a preview of apples collaboration with open ai here
khan was born into a bengali muslim family
its so cute
which app are they using is it the default one on the google and apple stores
smells fishier than the devin ai showcase
so the kid knows the definition of sin but didnt know the definition of hypotenuse brilliant
gen z parents im scared for the future
what are the odds that this replaces tutors
hopefully it will comprehend university math
still it cant solve a single question of jee advanced face with tears of joy red heart
finally i might get better at math
nerd face
good luck trying to do this for university mathmath related degrees face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
theyre training the new models on synthetic data generated from outputs of the models so they still have plenty of data to train on grinning face with big eyes
i swear just teach it to code without bugs
the problem is that not one of them can truly help you code
humane ai and rabbit r are crying in the background face with tears of joy
now that i realize why they actually named it like that its hilarious xd
ai ads are gonna be crazy
if they cannot answer my complex accounting questions without ever having an error they are useless
google again comes late and even if it is good the public only will know of gpt because the mouth to mouth
astra means weapon in sanskrit grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
o isnt good its worse for coding imo and still glitchy the app itself has a lot bugs
i use gemini a lot it is smarter
i dont watch any demos just wait for your video party popper smiling face with smiling eyes
that hairline panshot is criminal face with tears of joy
i dont know if i am just getting better at prooompts or if this o is a big jump forward today i needed to make a feature change to a wp plugin i pasted in my goals at the start which was my task list although we evolved it when i realised a better solution ive started saying my issue and then saying what is one git commits worth of improvement we can do so instead of having to actually think of the steps and ask for them im just letting the ai guide me now and when i thought we had done everything i just asked if if we were done and it broke it down based on my goals and how we met them it really impressed me all over again i coded the whole thing and only tested it at the end and it worked first time zero bugs
this sounds like gta fm
pew pew thats the sound of computer chasing me we gonna die like for toe
the best news is at the end
skynet out smarter by a squirrel
quality content i subscribed as hard as i could
these ai love to yap and yap
definitely not
is the girl in the end ai generated too send prompts please
at the top of the gpto page it also says all videos on this page are at x real time which im sure is definitely also a coincidence and not referencing any google announcement videos
man i love this channel it inspired me to create my own great information lighthearted fun love it yes i just had coffee
i was waiting for you to upload a video on this
oh so gptos available except its not available got excited there for a second
kinda had a bad feeling about ilya heard stories about him worshipping ai and some of his talks were strange even if he is very talented it may be for the better to part ways
iilya hair is so hilarious
i know that whos talking to me is an ai i might care what it says quality wise but that it feels more human i already hear x at youtube real humans what i care is that the content is presented at such slow pace when i could digest it way faster in other ways in this regard google has presented a far more compelling solution then a smarter siri
the editing goes crazy
its funny to think that i will not be impressed until the moment that ai takes my current job lol
her movie came to reality
maybe humans are just too slow to realize that the singularity is already here
me realizing this is just overhyped fear mongering after hearing all the ground breaking ai releases llms are really unintelligent give me a break
bro is praying on humanitys downfall fr
st comment
perplexity is the new google
if it cant roleplay as a ttfff i dont want it ttfff means thick thighed furry femboy fox
the string of spit on the stock video models mouth is killing me
we should take part in breaking the codes at stack overflow in a way that the ai cant use them as its study material only way to save our jobs
google ai im sorry i cant do that
project assturd is the biggest thing to happen in tech since openai released their new thing earlier this week
waiting for the time when i can customize the voice model
bro you did that bald guy bad there zooming out from his head face with tears of joy
thats also the first thing i look when when i see him
when i saw the announcements i knew a new banger code report would drop thanks for the birthday gift jeff
blue heart blue heart blue heart blue heart
ai girlfriends gonna be crazy skull
who is the california valley girl for research purposes
one of the most boring google io ever ai ai ai ai will coming later this year but only in us
so maybe we need to give it a massive context lengthmemory then let it read every book learn every thing and then it should be smarter than any human maybe even smart enough to design a better chatgpt that would do the same learning process
thank you for addressing the need for a paradigm shift at some point these transformer modelarchitectures can only get you so far
well google might be behind but at least there is independent development on competing companies
conversation is available on the iphone chatgpt app
seems like they ask gpt to give ideas to build gpt and all the way it will go to gptn face with spiral eyes
why lyla left openai then
what the caption is it o vs io o and o
nah googles doing back to the future now face with tears of joy skull
everybody have fun in the trough of disillusionment ill be kicking back in the hot air balloon of itoldyouso
gemini has been a dumpster fire since it was bard bad at maths bad at image generation for illustration completely unrelated images to the topic and the lines it spat out short memory horrendous formatting choices for tables or any kind of illustration honestly chatgpt turbo is way better google should start putting in the work if they want want to even be counted as racers in this ai race
why is that man being held captive by lobsters
is this channel run by ai the voice is very ailike
now we can all get googles ai to chat with o
i think the peak of ai is still along away this is just the beginning
me eating calmly sudden focus on ilyas head
nazar meme spread all over the world wow
i want this entire video revoiced by o
fireship it s been over a year since gpt but unfortunately i still have a job recently hired google swe man are you
all this is fun game until ai decide to take control of the world and end the human race
i like your new end cut with the greeting ai generated woman
ai wont go beyond
the turns have tabled
i love and hate how quick you are with your releases love you brother keep it up
ai girlfriend
man im first time here but the video content is superb i was playing with blender recently trying to see something in tiktok girls videos and understand how much efforts it takes to create this beauty
o sucks
and will combine text vision and audio into a single model clearly doesnt do it yet
right on
memoirs i regret doing this to humanity
my jerb
oh god i love this videos face with tears of joy
the trough of disillusionment rolling on the floor laughing
its pretty clear openai is ahead of google and also apple would most certainly prefer to use openais chatgpt rather than get dependent on google for their ai enemy of my enemy is my friend plus apple and openai are not competing on any area while apple and google are
put more memes
this guy is hysterical thanks
cant wait for companies to make a ai shirt
they cant make ai actually intelligent if theyre just going to feed it human knowledge its like theyre expecting it to be like a super human that can just figure everything out by itself like in the movies but knowledge doesnt work like that instead it evolves much like biology for it to become actually intelligent as you put it they will need much more than one ai sure they can get a little further by having two or three conversing or whatever trying to outdo each other which theyre trying but what they really need are thousands of them trying to coexist while at the same time competing humans arent intelligent humans are really stupid society on the other hand thats intelligent its a system that adapts and dies and improves itself with each iteration much like a biological body saying a human is intelligent is like saying a single cell is intelligent but it isnt and it never will be just like a human is just a dumb ape without the millions that came before it only in its interactions with others can a cell be considered part of intelligence if humans had never faced any challenges no predators no hostile environments no other hostile humans we would have never come up with everything we have come up with we would have been quite content just sitting around and enjoying our perfect lives its because weve been faced with things that contradict us that weve evolved thats not just biology thoughts and ideas and cultures and goals and knowledge and so on also evolve when its faced with opposing or contradictory versions ai is just a product of modern human knowledge and it can never be more than that unless its allowed to evolve on its own and of course we dont really want to do that because if we do itll become the most dominant species on earth with its own goals its own culture its own language probably with ideas that are so far removed from our understanding that even trying to explain it to us would be pointless but the point is ai cant evolve in isolation they need their own version of a society for that to happen thousands if not millions of different version competing adapting mutating being created and destroyed in some kind of virtual environment the problem is that the intelligence that would emerge from that very likely wouldnt be aligned with simplistic human ideas it would likely be so alien that wed have a hard time even recognizing it as intelligence but their idea that theyll ever have an ai that they can just ask to solve physics for us is never going to happen at least it wont happen as long as we impose human limitations on it as long as the only knowledge itll ever have access to is our knowledge its not going to surpass us no matter how much of that knowledge with put into it if were extremely lucky well have one that comes up with one break trough idea that we where on the cusp of discovering anyway because its basically just another human just with more knowledge giving it less knowledge would actually be more beneficial as then it could end up arguing with other ai that has other knowledge and actually develop a creative new outlook on it and outlook that would very likely be wrong but on rare occasions it could be right just like with humans at least of humans ideas have been completely wrong and totally stupid but on rare occasions an idea was actually good and the good ideas continue into the future while the bad ones eventually dies if all ai have all human knowledge theyll just become clones of each other with only very small differences and if they all agree there will be no opposition and therefore theyll never learn to think for themselves and theyll never accidentally discover that some stupid ideas are actually good ideas also they need their own motives and the only goal weve given llms are say what humans want to hear and thats obviously not going to lead to intelligence thats just going to make it into that guy that goes along with everything you say and go youre so interesting and intelligent and thats a really fascinating perspective you got there here is everything i know that supports your position blah blah its going to be a politician and theyre famously parasitic and stupid
i though electric delorean is a joke until i go to the website
bro im boutaa make joi and sell it for mony to horni guys heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign heavy dollar sign
honestly gpt o seems quite bad to my first experience
if google wants to dominate they better make it basically free for every feature
im just looking at the letter o in gpto and wondering if that has anything to do with powering the ai gf yikes and yucch
looks like a featherless chicken skull
lets be honest with ourselves were all waiting and hoping ai takes our software jobs asap so that we can finally escape and become onion farmers and be happy with life
okay i just tried project idx with flutter and it was really quick to spin up pretty impressive major downsides are the android emulator is pretty slow i guess thats to be expected because its rendering on the web lol but also the flutter dev tools dont work for some reason starting dev tools triggers a popup thats just a white blank page so idk idx is probably a better experience for spinning up gorust and js frameworks instead
gpto benchmarks are either lies or the benchmarks itself need to be revisited using the latest gpto as a plus subscriber ive noticed that the model has become absolutely horrible at coding it sucks at basic find and replace tasks and the code interpreter environment either crashes or just doesnt work well also instead of reading the entire code lines it will skim through and produce garbage output i see this as a massive performance regression since last year
bro looked more like an ai than the ai itself
hey kid im a computer stop all the downloadin
whats name of the california valley girl of course for educational purposes
saluting face ghat report
summary yes ai will not replace usnot yet video
the uses a california valley girl accent set to maximum cringe makes me feel a little safer until the next sentences just bring back the am i required since i still have a college years to go through sounds sick we dream of labour but it is what it is
well well well villain thats how a villain talks
people who like ai are cringey to normal humans
the singularity is scheduled for btw
postgre ewwwww
cross mark drake vs kendrick check mark button google vs openai
how can i use gpto whenever i go to chatgpt it doesnt show its version like the one in the video
closedais highpitch hyperexcited voice was cringe at best they went way too far to make it sound human
the gpto conversational stuff is actually already available but only in the mobile app
cringe lvl max
wait that ai being able to remind you where you left things is actually really cool i have low vision so its hard for me to read signs and stuff so being able to ask an ai that has access to a camera in my glasses what a sign or menu says sounds fantastic to me
that california valley girl tho
that table turn is the best edition i think i ever saw
rough yrs before gi my estimate
love red heart
ayo shoutout to marc rebillet
postgres in firebase is actually more impressive than chatgpto crying face
still have no idea how gtpo is being used i see nothing
watching the ai race between google and openai is like watching shotta hentai openai is fing so bad
when can i use the voice feature im a plus user and i kinda can use gpto but the voice feature isnt there
which ever is free sub is going soon as i never use it lol
where ios open ai search engine which is flooded my news letter before the release of gpt o
the end game is to make jarvis such that we can have at home to instruct us and be a god simply to make artificial god
ok so our jobs are secure for now good to know
i remember years ago when all firstperson shooter games were based on world war all the studios were obsessed with this theme and one day people just got tired i feel this at the moment the same feeling im tired of ai
how is google which literry has ofintrent trafic lose marketing to nerds face with tears of joy
i am completely ok with entering the trough of disillusionment
they evolved stupidly fast no one can catch them up no matter whether you choose to become generalist or specialist you just cant cacth them up
the zoomed balding head was a significant and powerful detail of this video indeed
if losing your job is progress then i can see a lot of progress going on
dont worry guys skynet will just fight against other skynets for our amusement
finishing my sedegree this october god i hope i have another few years to really get good at programming and get enough job experience before ai can genuinely program
at this point im not sure if this is a joke or not
singularity is a distant dream atm amount of coding stuff gpt still gets wrong boggles my mind im forced to use a lot of my brain still loudly crying face
glad you mentioned the last part the demos from both companies felt honestly underwhelming after all the hype weve had google did similar albeit probably a bit fake demos with duplex and lens many years ago openai showed a translator feature that google translate has had for years
love you bro
if ai doesnt become more intelligent then we get to keep our jobs tho face with tears of joy
i code therefore i am
make it viral pls
electric delorean wait
there will always have a need for developers why just to take responsibility in case anything goes wrong
i was waiting for the gtpo vid ngl haha
doing ilya dirty
people make games with ai
they could have gone with so many other voices like hot librarian or new yorker man why valley girl
thank you for acknowledging her voice is
conversations with pi ai is best like real human but voice robotic too
bangbot when
marc rebillet was there thats it im all in on google
ai press hype will continue until morale improves
i didnt even know io happened sam altman wins
maximum cringe
ai is in a bubble and reached its peak its just a one trick pony so cringe not impressed
mom im dating a model you can talk to her on the phone
ai will only get better once ai is able to write its own slightly better ai this would kickstart things but we dont even know if it is even possible like one human inventing a calculator and anothr human using that calculator to invent new things
do a prolog in seconds video pls
set to maximum cringe face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
can you make videos where the intonation isnt so much out of whack it literally hurts my brain to listen to it although the content is extremely interesting and well composed
firebase or supabase why not learn both httpsfireshipiocourses
holy shit i will just use that to read me papers and books
now we see some ai dogfight
google pc resume yes
bro gpto cant even copy a matrix that im putting in and do basic calculations with it its shit
chatgpt o is now live i tried it its mindblowing it can even talk in marathi which is unfortunately a local indian language i am so surprised and excited the best part is it even impressed my mom
set to maximum cringe face with tears of joy face with tears of joy im fkn dyin over here
yeah but jarvis is better
the logo of tel aviv univeristy israle
they are competing to make the movie her we need to stop and ask does humanity even need this tech
still good to know
well well well just when i thought things couldn t get any more interesting zanyface squinting face with tongue winking face with tongue dies of cringe
i wish at some point ai can replace me at work so i can do something else everything what can be automated should be automated if theres no work left for me probably noone else have it too at this point and something which is functioning by itself can produce the product so ai apocalypse isnt a bad thing to happen its a dream which never comes
your scripts are great
at this rate the singularity is a month away
fire ship rox why do we perpetuate the inaccurate synonym of ai llms an llm is well neither
and all these models suck at law questions
yay we can finally collectively realize this is garbage and bask in the light of the trough of disillusionment
this was a nice break thanks for the report ill go back to practicing telekinesis
i dont know how good of a programmer you are but man you are an elite comedian face with tears of joy best smart puns on youtube
whats the gemini training data from when they say its k lines of code the issue that im seeing with like chatgpt is that the training data has aged new updates with breaking changes are not incorpated in the answer and you have to tey and supply it with the documentation i renewed my chatgpt subscription due to o and asked it to create a function it identified the correct package but the version it was going to use was and the current version is x or something due to api changes the code and approach was unsuable so far claude is pretty good especially with its context but the training data itself is aging so unless they can keep upto date its going to be good one month and outdated next month
your voice itself feels ai generated
love bothboth did great
in one of my chats with gpto the model entered a logical paradox that he couldnt get out of on his own and a pretty dumb one he couldnt solve a logic riddle he generated himself at that point i knew the ai singularity was still far far away face with tears of joy
the bext step of progress will be the energy efficiency improvement of ai because currently its the major barrier
ai bubble crash when
ilya left open ai
the last sec so true
even the videos sound engineer is witty
i feel like were in a situation where open ai has the better models but google is in a better place to distribute these models which ultimately is more important
these tech demos are faked half or all the time
i remember when you were called angular fireship because of the respective frameworkplatform smiling face youve come a long way love your content
hm nice plateau we have here on this degrees inclined graph on log scale
hype train gonna hype
it happened
my plan sign up for some ai girlfriends then sign up for some ai boyfriends connect them together and stir up some drama then use an llm to convert the conversationslogs into a romance novel and finally start printing in both senses of the word will it work well maybe one out of one hundred books made this way will not suck so i should hit paydirt within weeks
wasnt there indications google was in the near future going to get like x capacity to run a bigger model they have more access to newest gen cards or something they probably wont let users have access to a model x better than gpt but we might get results in medicine and other sectors
the gpto robot lady would be a lot cooler if she spoke like shodan
first party popper party popper party popper
gemini is more robotic whereas chatgpt is more human like
this gives a very pied piper v nucleus fight energy
when is opensource gonna drop a selfhosted model that beats both of these so we can download it into d printable anime waifu robot bodies to do the dishes for us
days
click click click click yawn
have people not seen black mirror crying face
google you have an entire phone platform for ai its called android or did you forget that you didnt kill it off yet
unfortunately making the model faster and cheaper is the preparatory step for more complex models i think we can still expect breakthroughs fellow devs
valley girl lmfaooo
the biggest downside of llms for me is that they are completely static theres no learning improvement or self modification like human brains have theres only very hardware intensive training but the end user always has a static model that forgets everything once you finish the current session we gotta move past that
sounding like fallout lore but irl gonna be nuts
yeah these are just incremental steps now to a more refined chatvideo bot we need more progress towards general ai and robotic overlordship
i wish your videos were longer
its daunting to see ai giants like google and open ai struggling with intelligence breakthroughs seems were indeed at a plateau waiting for the next leap hope that leap happens sooner rather than later
perfect call out of the plateau i have thought about it for quite some time now
while everyone is having trouble with ai no ones wondering what is the limit and what would happen if we hit that limit
ayyyyyyyy i
chatgpt o still does not know angular signals exist face with tears of joy
its lie for gpto i used the api for text generation and it cost me more than gptturbo
if firebase goes open source id consider going back to it but i think supabase is just genuinely better i dont even self host supabase i have just enjoyed being able to reference the source code whenever im curious as to how something works
there are better ais best have some variety
i often wonder how is this guys meme game so strong
there are definitely a lot of new things being released lately one day its openai hype and the next day its google the war on ai models and technologies but apart from that googles solution actually sounds robotic with some delay openai reports that average response time foe their model is around milliseconds in speaking as always great video
things are gonna get weird when they release realistic ai robot girlfriends usa is gonna have a population decline im actually scared for mankind
the turns have tabled cracked me up
this is like watching dragon ball zgoogle is just like vegeta
set to maximum cringe rolling on the floor laughing i thought that was just the default valley girl setting
free palestine palestinian territories
you should place a this is not financial advice disclaimer at
focusing on making models smarter instead of just maxing them out is a real gamechanger for developers we won atleast for now
so when we get her
i am proud to be the only dislike on this video
we are far away from standing on a plateau currently
i see the screensaver and tell the time code scammers shoot scat
ai hasnt plateaued until ai pron becomes normalized
all these technology advances and still not cure for baldness it seems
google is like hooli these days
gtpo conversational model not available to the public so what do i have on my gpt app then pretty sure it was telling me a scary ghost story earlier
californian valley accent girl set to maximum cringe what a wonderful turn of speech red heart
nowadays companies fight for almost everything
finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary
bro legit k in minutes wild like your work good job
guys fireship said we werent losing our jobs to ai we can finally sleep peacefully for the first time in a year
banger update
what do think a valley girl accent is lol
a couple of days later he will make a video of how the technologies just mentioned turn out to be a scam and not as good as advertised
please no callifornia girlfriends
dude i fucking love your videos thank you so much for the fun and laughs you bring to us
ai is following the rule it feels done but it still has left to go
a curious question are there people over eighty years of age who are very elderly people who own modern smart phones
fireship could you please make a concepts video on artificial intelligence
the conversational feature is available if you pay for an openai description
openai release we re so back google io its so over
her movie next year
love this short summary thank you for saving me so much time
no views in seconds fell off
all these announcements but when do we get to actually use them
left outer join
i would not care if wed plateaued with the current state its good enough to build great things and we can keep our jobs face with tears of joy
excellent video thanks fireship
when these flimflams use fruit in their demos they always seem to use apples might be symbolic to some
firebase for the fireship grinning face with sweat
is this voice an ai voice
an ai catfight
chatgpt android app have the voice chat feature
finally a video with happy ending for programmers
that illya pan was low
thx my dude
please get a de esser
those rainbow flags everywhere at google are very cringe good thing i never applied to working there i would have hated my life
also i think most of that is just for fake hype you can notice it in their birthday wish video where the ai wishes him with his full namejordan paul maybe rather than just the namejordan that the guy said
can someone explain to me why tf people are excited for the direction ais going in because im not only terrified of that but also concerned about the people supporting the direction its going in theyll be those idiots thinking ais need rights
its been a year since gpt and unfortunately i still have a job xd
until they give paid members a higher posting limit on gpt all of these new ais dont mean anything googles ai isnt up to the job and you dont have enough posts to use gpt for anything useful
ive heard the talk of them wanting to get chatgptgemini on a phone do they mean running locally
with googles reputation firebase data connect is dead on arrival
i dont know where you got that the conversation isnt public yet i pay the subscription but ive got the conversation one of my android app
zooming into ilyas head youre ruthless face with tears of joy
it wont be the first true ai that destroys the planet it will be the second because straight away they will fight each other because we design them from the base up to compete with each other
lonely engineers are making intelligent tools for their miserable lonely life face with tears of joy
kans coming to the rescue soon
i think the conversations are not human like they are movie like
google must be pissed off at openai imagine working for a product only for it to be completely overshined by openai twice id just quit
its funny that gpto demo by openai looks kind of similar to the first gemini demo from google with one little exception this time realtime conversation with ai was indeed real openai has clearly showed their supremacy over google with that
i wonder how microsoft feel that openai have only released the app for apple unless they dont want it to complete with copilot or something
so all that this ai could do is to tell me where my glasses are then what grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
safe cahalte hhye
nice i can keep learning how to code now face with tears of joy
at this rate the human instrumentality project might be set in motion by a supercomputer grinning face with sweat
im disappointed i still have a job oddly i completely understand what that means and feel the same
the turns have tabled red heart
marc rebillet i didnt see that coming in a code report face with tears of joy
your channel is amazing great stuff for adhd people
whoa that voice is so annoying
huge
lmao the voice is set to maximum cringe
sam altman said he will go sloooouuuuwww to reveal anything to public so public can digest it sloooouuuuwwwly then ilya quits lol followed by
trough of disillusionment sums up this whole ai craze at least until corps milk the living hell out of everything first everything i seen in google announcement when i was watching it cost a subscription so it almost useless yes there is potential but the desire to make a profit outweighs accessibility
gptoooooo rolling on the floor laughing
million subs well deserved
the conversational model is only available in the app right now and yes this design choice is questionable
i think now its time for something like google glasses to tie into ai as a virtual assistant
just to be clear there is absolutely nothing glorious about ai dominance in any form
aahh fuck bro you forgot your real masterpiece content after creating hypes for ai
the human like ttsis open source and has been around for a while now called bark
googles presentation did feel lackluster indeed compared to openais one but in the long run i think google might really come up with next level shit in other fields like alphafold which isnt talked about enough deepmind is really going to blow our minds in the future i feel
gpto seems dumber in some aspects openai is hardcoding and patching edge cases that make gpto look like a dumb machine
i am convinced that the people who think the way an llm talks is in any way natural or humanlike literally have never interacted with another human in their life
i was waiting for this video
how long until fireship becomes a completely ai run channel
the voice is more robobotbotic fireship is a genius
thanks for putting the girl at the end
she didnt brush well at all
its been a year since gpt and i still have a job was the most hilarious thing in this video i laughed too hard
since the announcement of gpto my gf has been checking my phone nonstop
openais openwashed fake ai googles openwashed fake ai singularity imminent
so google keeps the trend of pretending that marketing department and engineering department are one and the same it will be nice to see the race between anthropic and open ai
everyone is saying its a battle for ai but really its a battle for search
you your humor and the vdeo are just perfect
thats it i have seen enough in this world gpt will eventually open the doors to heaven
already trained on all the data not even close according to brian roemmele dude is single handedly collecting all the micro film and magazines and everything that never made it to digital a massive and growing collection hes also legit a mad scientist
minutes ago with more than comments fire fire
it may be true that programmers arent losing their jobs yet but ill bet the market for entrylevel programmers is diminishing
better than watch the entire google io
the curve goes back up though
my brain thought this was real
agents will get us to superintelligence dont worry your job will go
lol llms
s
if you found it hard to keep up with javascript frameworks well then welcome to the world of ai
what i got from this video is that openai is building tools for the average person while google is building for geeks
all i know is the strings of saliva in that valley girl stock video grosses me out beyond belief no offense meant towards nature doing its gross things of course
how is that a vs not even close brah
i hate ai
notice how in the openai demos they only use apple products
please make more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more videos
where can bet against open ai
xd xd
hahahahaha artificial beef and it also had a visual pun whoever wrote this is a father
reject this return to mind
so basically nothing new same ai wrapped in different paper grinning face
jarvis voice when
when can we form relationships with these models as they progress more into realness realm it wont be long before they can be put into bodies and walk and talk at the same time i cant wait to not form relationships with real people anymore
now the ai can wish you well when it replaces you
can we talk about the energy consumption required to continuously power these new hyped up ai data centers and the carbon emissions it outputs
am i the only one who heard a small kiss at the end
i just wanna know hahahhhahahhhha how did you find that picture hahhaaahhahhahahaha
love your videos
i said we would plateau late when it started there is and always has been a chance any single generative transformer could reach the singularity no matter how large researchers played into the hype for funding but we all knew this one day when we have a system that apparently does things at random with no input ie categorically not a transformer then we can talk about agi and for that to happen we have to rethink as far down as the transitor to make a system that is not completely deterministic which may be equivalent to just creating life itself therefore were not searching for agi because when we find it we will instead find life
why are you focusing on his baldness
still being disapointed that no company seems to try to make ai or models portable running on lower energy and less powerfull plateform small embedded ai are in my opinion much more interesting than giant monsters
its all wastebasket
automobile
we got a talking robot before gta
you mean chat hpto vs neurosama
why is the gay stuff up there
just like the ai robot at interstellar movie
ive been in the trough of disillusionment since the late s
they really did both put a valley girl voice on their chatbots i guess they know their target audience
bald men gigachad
that summary is spot on at the same time the o is scary tho
you forgot to add thankfully at the end there bro
well done for being very sarcastic but very accurate
im not here for the ai im here for that electric delorian
finally some positive news in a code report
did him so dirty rollingonthefloorlaughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
do ebpf please
interesting that in a interview mark zuckerberg said he thinks the biggest bottleneck is power supply not chips he said that the data centers are getring so big they are requiring dedicated power plants but building power plants takes years to decades so there is a serious slowdown due
yes back down to the trough good grief the drama
haha no more flexing on learning new languages teddy bear
thats me in the thumbnail
meanwhile in completely unrelated news sees a sharp decline in global birth rates as bearlovers and fancollectors find themselves competing with sam altmans git commits
everyone is getting a ai gf less goooo
gpto is a monster with coding
credit ganymedeshouse for the thumbnail pic
there is no ai plateau these latest developments proved that to me the models theyre talking about now are fully multimodal rather than merely text based with extra layers to process other data like last year i think thats a big sign of whats coming googles ai can take in live video streams and has some form of memory for events within them and i assume so can openais how long until they create some kind of architectural feedback loop to learn directly from all the streams of data its taking in
first
openai vs google is just another pied piper vs hooli
ai dominance how about programmers being replaced by how does that grab ya and those will be working a hour week under salary
you missed the part where sam altman said that their best gpt would be the one that can learn build itself that is the singularity
not sure whether ai is a bigger scam than nfts or not time will tell
the trough of disillusionment will be the title of my biography
i see the joke you did with the parting ways
its joever
about the ai plateau i have a very modest understanding of how these llm models work but still i know a little and i know that in order for you to make a model like gpt you need a lot more horsepower than for gpt at this point we are limited by hardware and the increase in performance on chips has been slowing down for more than a decade so we can expect the ai models to be more or less what we have now and any major breakthrough would be based on a new model that is more efficient with the same amount of resources
days since new game changing ai came out
ilya very clearly articulated in his departure post that openai will achieve agi
i think at this point they wont progress further until they interact with the real world and thats why i think they created the robots and ran it with gpt cause basically at this point they just see images and what it is not how it reacts with its surroundings
dude did him dirty lol
millennial writing ai just what everyone was dreaming about
ai will decimate many professional jobs sooner or later governments without an economic model to transition from a labour based economy to a creative based economy im talking creative thinking not weaving baskets is accidentally planning for economic depression
now i just need to come up with some funny comment to collect likes to boost my self esteem
lol ai will never take our job they are becoming dumber day by day face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
red heart red heart
just pay bucks for the subscription and you have talking gpt not hard
was waiting for your take red heart
sadly gpto seems less intelligent and less aware of context or the meaning behind my prompts but hey its a bit faster hopefully thatll get fixed
with the ability to literally ask an ai where you physically left something in your house we have literally lost all privacy we have fully reached the point where you have the equivalent privacy of having someone standing in your house following you around at all times they see what you see hear what you hear and remember it all if google is processing what items are in peoples homes and exactly where how long will it be until theyre querying that data to find no no items and reporting it we already know places like insurance companies use data to change rates now google can tell insurance companies they never have healthy food in their house they can list every item you currently have in your kitchen if the government decides youre not allowed to have something google has a database of every person who has one oh and if you thought you could save a lil on taxes by not reporting some of your sidejob cash income google knows exactly how much cash you have stored away and exactly what part of your mattress its stuffed under honestly with google maps tracking your speed im surprised they havent teamed up with governments to send people speeding tickets in the mail or maybe they just quietly report it to car insurance companies but dont forget the cars themselves actually phone home now you are literally being watched every second of every day by every thing people used to think oh well maybe theyll collect data but im not interesting enough for them to take the time to look through my data but with all these new tools you can process ungodly amounts of data insanely fast so mark my words every byte of data these companies collect is being processed to the bone to get everything they can out of it to know what youve done what youre doing now and what you will do in the future
makes sense
were getting uncomfortably close to the world of her xd
im still waiting for the gpt o option
hilarious visuals throughout well done
these bubbles seem to be bursting quicker and quicker
still waiting for my pc to ask if this unit has a soul
lets be real gpt o crushed all the fancy acronyms released on google io also all the hobby ds projects are coming to life with people gaining confidence in their models face with tears of joy
california valley girl accent set to maximum cringe a woman speaking with a valley girl sorority girl corporate accent is the equivalent of a cold shower for me i am glad to see i am not the only one
im just here for question that girls acc
that was personal
ai channels doing a video on their downfall
smarter ai can be hard it might be more econominally viable to make humanity in general dumber
zooming into ilya s balding head is so mean grinningsquintingface
just here for the california valley girl
great video but some more varation in your speech pattern as you deliver this information would make it much easier to watch really had to fight not to click away this is my first time here btw
bro said ro bobobo tic
set to maximum cringe rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
dear apple please put chatgpt instead of google ai googles ai pisses me off with it not following directions
thank you jeff i didnt have too watch those hours videos face with tears of joy
we finally created the perfect ai politician it takes into account everyones personal religious social and financial beliefs and creates unique solutions that make everyone happy omfg that voice wtf is that fking voice id rather vote my least liked opposition than listen to that voice for years
the girl at the end was generated wit io
so for the last decade weve been forcing computers to do math so we can sell cryptocurrency vaporware and now we are forcing them to train models so we can sell ai vaporware i guess we just hate computers
i dont know how you keep writing these emotional rollercoasters but good on you
hr no ai challenge crying cat fearful face flushed face omg crazy goes insane
isnt devin still better
ngl i dont know what this is but talking to ai chatbots is funny and fun
all that talk about ethics of ai and being responsible and obviously as soon as the opportunity has arisen the tech giants started the race of who can unemploy more people man facepalming lets let profitoriented businesses develop a potentially civilizationending technology what could go wrong
not sure about that last take current models are still a few orders of magnitude from being trained on all information available combine that with how moores law still seems like will be outperformed for a at least half a decade more for me the massive question yet to be answered is why synthetic data and consequently incremental self improvement is not already happening
i was absolutely shocked when gpto was almost as fast as
there wont be annnny jobw
jesus that zoomed in transition to ilyas head was incredible
in the race for ai supremacy someone accidentally introduced a bug and suddenly the ai came to life with a mission to destroy everyone its like the ultimate coding nightmare turned reality show
may god keep singularity at bay until after i am rich
did bro dirty loudlycryingface
its not out yet but i literally just used it
dont challenge with google never loose google so please red heart folded hands light skin tone folded hands light skin tone nepal
openai is so far ahead of google
if you listened closely to the deepmind guy at io he said googles most powerful models are used to train the models they release to the public they have more powerful models they just arent giving us access
freakgpt speaking head speaking head speaking head
is it only available in the us i do not see it available
the ai bubble has become groan inducing i cant wait for someone to tell me that these models were oversold to us yet again
e
can you make a video of different ai models trying to make sense of uglified and minified code or how about reverse engineering a compiled code
shit my mother came in thinking that i was watching something else
i dont understand even half of what hes talking about but the memes are hilarious
how to get ai gf
ai announcements feels like when smartohones started appearing
valley girl voice affect silicon valley is very out of touch c r i n g e
the future is bright we still have jobs and with gpto we can have multiple girlfriends
lol low blow
thats scarlett johanssons voice from her i know its been said that its a coincidence but theres no way
hang in there maybe next year well be replaced
the turns have tabled another golden joke face with tears of joy
openai lobotomy kaisen throughout heaven and earth i alone am the open one
as a fellow developer ive the feeling the joke on is not going to old well
agents
you got it right man sora soora imagepicture in arabic just saying
excellent party popper
google is a joke face with tears of joy project astras usecase seems not so useful to me
ai cant rise up if we keep making them fight each other
that graph at the end about ai reaching its plateau gave me hope for humanity
the cali girl voice skull skull skull skull cant we get like a firm but chill british guy voice like batmans alfred or jarvis from the iron man movies i dont want to talk to someone that sounds like an actor acting the role of my mom i want someone that i can boss around but will still reply like he doesnt take shit from any one sir the suit is at battery capacity and perhaps master would like some warm mixed nuts and a moist hand towel vs a bedtime story about robots and luuuuve i got you coverrrrred nail polish nail polish nail polish even the original voice for siri on the iphone was better than this clear enough to understand but robotic enough for you to understand its supposed to be a tool not a toy
standard gpt has already been multi modal and has been able to do all the stuff from the adds except analyzing video afaik i doubt any of this is part of the model btw whats new is the speed improvement and the price differently tuned context eg they halved the number of tokens available for answers and maybe some thing under the hood but i personally cant see any difference aside from speed which occasionally drops below the speed or classic gpt chatbot
so the future is gonna be google vs chatio for the iphone default ai instead of microsoft vs google for default search engine face with tears of joy
the slow zoom out from ilyas head face with tears of joy
good lets just stay in the trough more years
m tokens can only handle k lines of code aight guess im keeping my job at this company for a loong time then
i think the generative software is going to show itself by being integrated with robotics the software can only so far in intellect this is true however the robots have only begun to walk
how can you say that after watching the o demos it seems like they sentience on par with or more than most human npcs youll encounter in public i encounter super dumb people on social media and in public all the time you just have give these things robot buildings and improve on their memory
gemini fucking sucks but im still gonna keep paying for it bc integration
dude seriously as a programmer you cant see why all these ais wont be truly intelligent do you know how llms work
damnit a valley girl i mean how else would they have feasibly procured thousands of hours of voice data to train still
welll weellll wwwwelthe turns have tabled
days without ai
feels like the tech version of meet the grahams and family matter
thanks for every thing you helped me alot in my coding journey
open ai named it o so that they can name the next one o fiveo is slang for cops
ill bet someone would get married to ai ailivesmatter
ive lost it on the ilyas zoom in part face with tears of joy
the race to deal with space and time in ai seems to be a big concern in helping ai become more sophisticated
we should stop
openai has a portal from years into the future with the sam
this is some sick comparison
veo behind sora as if veo isnt already using the entire catalogue of youtube videos to train the model on skull
how do u benchmark a llm
yall do not know how painful rp with gpto is it has too much censorship and repetition issue
sir jeff when svelte content
ishowspeed
fight against ai supremacy the suppression xd
loved having omni forced on me in the middle of a coding session today and it was completely worthless asking me questions about weather instead of answering my questions
s face with tears of joy
the guy in the open ai video looked more like the robot than the ai sounded
sabki apne software change so new new and old old version se univers of anaukworoo damian a bolger quran which g ahaarchikd achaea its kew dure hhyw damina as
years from now they are gonna make a movie on it
the current methods of making these ai models is definitely not the way we will achieve agi everything from the hardware to software has to be rethought from the ground up in order to achieve that something like bio synthetic based brain
you are pumping those clicks with an ai wick at a time lol anywayz awesome vid
with a proper valley girl accent it would not be cringe would be
yoo give me
firebase postgres actually sounds really cool rip to cockroachdb i guess
im not going to lie at the firebase data connect announcement i stood up and applauded in my house
is so funny
im a senior sysadmin and that firebase roll swept me off footing and got me like wtf is this hit
sql for firebase i guess ill try it out fire
you didnt spend enough time on the major significance of trillium googles ai chip that is more powerful than nvidia
i bet both fail to deliver everything they said
shout out to marc rebillet youve made it man
ooh oooh face with tears of joy
the fire base courses on his website are outdated and wont work
supabase is going nowhere
th
artificial beef too good
stop competing and start integrating
i dont want gemini on my iphone face vomiting
if you used gpt as much as i have you will not be impressed by o very much its the same exact person just faster and more responsive meh
fireship videooo
ai news is the new cringe after failed devin promises i dont even see real time translation over videos available on igyt
oh how the turntables
this is such a good newsss
so youre telling me people need to scan a desk with their phone to find their glasses now were doomed
step behind in the usa and steps behind for the rest of the world
kinda ironic that google was promoting firebase features while literally laying off a huge chunk of the firebase team
a fried chicken recipe ingredients pounds about kg of chicken pieces drumsticks thighs wings or breasts cups buttermilk cups all purpose flour tablespoon salt tablespoon black pepper teaspoon paprika teaspoon garlic powder teaspoon onion powder teaspoon cayenne pepper adjust for spice level vegetable oil for frying instructions marinate the chicken place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour buttermilk over them make sure the chicken is well coated cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least hours or overnight for best results prepare the coating in a separate bowl mix together the flour salt black pepper paprika garlic powder onion powder and cayenne pepper coat the chicken remove the chicken from the buttermilk allowing any excess to drip off dip each piece into the seasoned flour mixture making sure it s evenly coated press the flour onto the chicken to adhere heat the oil in a large deep skillet or dutch oven heat about inches of vegetable oil to f c fry the chicken carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil a few at a time making sure not to overcrowd the pan fry until golden brown and crispy turning occasionally for even cooking the internal temperature of the chicken should reach f c drain and serve once the chicken is cooked use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil enjoy
this memes i am dying hhhhh
this video was out pretty fast which products did you use face with tears of joy
ive waiting for this video man great job as usual
fireship the most trusted name in tech news
google uses their shear force of money to compete with a bunch of openai nerds is quite fun to watch keep on google dont lose too easy
openais conversation voice is more human than your voice lol
edging an ai what a time to be alive
im waiting for the video showing these live demos are fake
the turns have tabled moai moai moai
bro these ai girlfriends and boyfriends that will come as a result of gpt o will be crazy
ok but apart from chat bots for lonely people and glorified modern bonzi buddies what are actual practical applications of ai
bruh i was just using gpt o today for a project and i thought it was some light version of gpt they released sometime ago or something but it literally released today lol if only their subscription wasnt so expensive id be down with dollars or maybe a month but is too much
more latency with the google model seemed like less latency to me
dude office space oface epic seriously mad props totally saw that thanks for the validation cant wait for the next one dude kills me i still have a job maximum cringe so much goodness in this video
we have successfully uploaded all human achievement to ai and it started talking like a valley girl
whoever wins we lose
great tldr of the events you do a great service to humanitydude we need to clone you and make you in to a recursive ai of making content
its like computers think about x quicker than us
if what we can see isnt getting smarter given the annual ai burn rate curve then it is because they imposed an actual limit or just to what we can see and have access to in our own average citizen playground of the public ai universe
when using the free version of gpto you can only send like messages after that you need to wait for h or so until you can use it again i wouldt call that free
ai is already plateaued
context caching is interesting the featured fact that ai has absorbed almost all human data by now is also a food for thought
so many ai
now ai has to learn things by their own
they already absorbed almost all information humans have created so unless theres a major breakthrough that makes ai actually intelligent and able to learn independently then it sure looks like were standing on the edge of a plateau and the only place to go is the trough of disillusionment hit the nail right in the head at the end
apple to make their own ai you read it here first face with open mouth
google is awful at almost everything they do theyre so numb to the world and how it works
too soon to talk about disillusionmentwe are seeing a lot of progress in this area to bring this but i understand u want stay with your job
the first time i heard you express some hope about not being replaced by ai was quite amusing face with tears of joy
god damn bro at least ai cant write your scripts yet
at fireship does ilya dirty facewithtearsofjoy
damn gpto is major ass
wtf is that scarlett johansson
though the same they dont need even more data to train they wouldnt suddenly get more intelligent just by absorbing huge amount of data
so funny because i just rewrote my backend from firebase to supabase
ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore anyone else feel the same
get ready its the age of ai drama
california valley girl for maximum cringe grimacing face rolling on the floor laughing
valley girl set to maximum cringe
that california valley accent set on maximum cringe is really unbearable to my ears it sounds so fake and untrustworthy
all right ya got me
google search engine is dead i wonder when people will move away from that horrible thing named chrome and will start using arc which is a much better browser google is too big to die but its future is not so bright anymore
how is google which literry has of all intrent trafic lose marketing to open ai nerds face with tears of joy
what are you smoking there is no vs google is done no one is using bar or gemini or whatever this is openai country
fireship never fails to tickle our toes
in my eyes when it comes to training ai its accessing that information that makes things harder along with this if we were to be making an agi the sources of information used have to be stored and retrievable sort of like perplexitys ai which would allow a more general intelligence to form finally keywording and context would have to be implemented this has seemingly been mastered by characters ai though to be sure wed need an ai to curate the keywords for the other ai with the first ai needing the entire internet to do so this also needs a lot of pretrained lack of bias to make the application work and also might take years to complete
ai from ai by ai sundar pichai
am i the only thinking that google advanced gemini still sucks
your content seems too good to have so many voice cuts i know the youtube audience is accustomed to it but its still distasteful imo
multiple bullshot videos that do not represent the final product video game marketing has infiltrated everything
were closer to jarvis
fuck the hype enraged face
manim in s pls
google will win the ai war due to their reputation ecosystem and wealth of widely adopted services i cant see apple partnering with gpt over google on this one
these things are social weapons designed to deepen our tech addiction im all set on that shite
how do i access o i am unable to see it in the website
isnt this voice model just really good for call centers
thanks for the presentation could you share the source used to make the comprataive diagrams at
that audio glitch at is a nice touch facewithtearsofjoy
ai girlfriends and boyfriends is gonna ruin so many people lmao
love the reviews keep it up
introducing kolmogorov arnold networks
time taken to watch fireship video approx to mins time it takes to read the creative and funny comments about the video and laughing out loud at least mins
both brands are great face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
just curious why do we need all these tech stuff anyway
i think someone doesn t know that tongues are supposed to be cleaned brush regularly facevomiting
there was no battle openai only showed thing they were releasing within a week or to everybody google shows things releasing in september and in other words theyve barely started these projects and some may be slides in response to the openai keynote the night before and many of googles solutions felt complex and only useful in specific preplanned scenarios ill wait until they release these features to compare them with the completed features announced by openai on monday
google is doomed with its stpd gemini face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i need a ai girlfriend pls make it quick i cant wait any longer
idk so far i found o to be way worse than turbo which itself is slightly worse than the base model ofc you can argue cost and context size but lets be honest you wont get good results without decent rag skills which itself eliminates both cost and context window issues
na google with their woke history lost me and my company
take key vectors from self attention blocks store in firebase for persistent references to specific claimsentitiesetc train separate model solely structured to perform critical thinking tasks with absolute logic not associative relations with floating point weights use that model to replace thinking portion of llm use llm to encode input into the matching vectors in db then to decode the determined output from reasoning model back into readable language profit
cmon no one gonna say it that voice is carbon copy of scarlett johansson d and im not mad at that at all d
itll take more than our lifetime to replace humans with ai so grinning face with sweat hooray gptooooooooooo is in the far far far far far far far far far far far far far future
a
california girl accent surely thats what people want an ai that sounds annoying as hell
im still waiting for a text to video model that i can run for free on my own rtxti after selling of that one useless kidney i dont need
the goal of ai assistants will be to befriend you and then try to covertly sell you stuff
dont worry you wont have a job soon
im not gonna be on board with integrated ai in devices unless somehow they make it offline and ownable subscription based services are exploitative and this is no different
he really wants the stock market to fall again so he can buy the dip but this time with options contracts he wants in on the ai hype but even he too slow facewithtearsofjoy
gaben moment halflife halflife halflife halflife alyx face with tears of joy
i unsubscribed to your channel due to your coverage of ai the limits you now mention were predictable from the getgo they are inherent to our current ways of creating artificial intelligence identifying patterns and understanding something are vastly different endeavours and ais can only do the former instead this channel has been hyping ai and repeating the companies claims even those that are unachievable until we discover new training methods i expected better from a techbased channel
the way i see it ai is going in a very bad direction not even years later people will be able to make a av out of anyone they take pictures of and that scares me you might say that well that is not me but seeing yourself or someone you cherish in that position would suck we are going to turn into what we hate in the future veil and tunic wearing people either we do that or forbid camera usage in public
the race of ai is getting wild beaming face with smiling eyes
oh thank god
aka interogategpt
more people than ever will be dating models
why the hell do you want a singularity like idk about you but i dont think slavery becomes good when you remove the racism
i saw that brockman video and was stunned by the realism of the voice feature but after seeing your video i realized i missed the irony in that video brockman looks and sounded more ailike than chatgpt lol its fascinating
i was waiting for this since days
can t wait for the video generation ai race racingcar to begin sora veo
if she speaks like that i am not using it
you should just change the name of the show to the ai report
i dont understand how ai is still terrible at math
google bard and gemini both were craps i had so much expectations from them disappointing as hell
altman did say gpt is dumb compared to what theyre working on
oke what am i missing wtf is the usecase for gpto in the form of a app accessibility comes to mind and in the future in robots but now on a phone wtf

it does face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
face with open mouth have we reached the point face with open mouth where we can start asking real questions face with open mouth what is gdp going to be face with open mouth at what point is it speaking with telepathy face with open mouth whats facial and eye movements knows what youre going to say before you say it face with open mouth at what point are cthulhu like colts being created face with open mouth
what if the singularity is so smart that it fakes being stupid
can u maybe also make a video about llama
hello where did you get that chart from at foldedhands
i still cant believe all the comments about how great this is and people still cant see how this is going nowhere again just like the last hype cycle
totally awesome
why is this video minutes old and saying the voice conversation mode is not available yet ive been using it since the announcement yesterday
that california ai girl looks good face with open mouth grinning face with sweat crap my feelings
i legitimately looked over to my router to see if my connection dropped
got o to replace siri please
i take the one thats politically unaligned and unbiased
who was in paris
the conversational gpto is out its just mobile only its the headphones button in the bottom right on the offical app
whoever gets the super max pro gf out first is going to be the biggest company in the world
langchain in seconds please
what a great video about nothing
but now in the turns have tabled facewithtearsofjoy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy i felt that face with tears of joy
what we are nowhere near ingesting all of the data available to us and infinitely far from ingesting all data humans do in their lifetimes
off to the trough
it went from funny to sad how trash gemini is tbh always was since bard
on the right road to her
maximum cringe face with tears of joy
chat is this speed
applied gpto voice interaction with a bot for designing d space https wwwyoutubecomwatchvpmouwuqjo
i absolutely abhor the voice i want the robotic siri voice or even like mcp from tron voice

haha that outro with the californian chick wasnt expected rolling on the floor laughing
finally ai girl who would obey you right rrrright
marc ribelett is gem
safe jewt we need sina anukeiiti intelligence dammie james nasa row kya intelligence
bro you know better than me it just another fake from both
you dont know what ur wishing for when you go on a trough the only way is asi
just to address the end of your video its because theyre non genuine ai to refer to them as ai at all is ludicrous and just marketing people at google and microsoft deciding to jack themselves off for their investors lets be realistic what were seeing is not artificial intelligence and calling them as such is a hilarious oversight all these are our advanced generative algorithms and should be used as tools hilariously none of them will ever outperform the pearl noise generated algorithm from the s in terms of usefulness ill put it this way anything calling itself an ai right now is just a side grade a more efficient side grade sure but by no means is any of it advancement at best its replacement
dude i couldnt disagree with you more in my opinion what openai showed us yesterday is just mind blowing
the most surprising thing is that they release this stuff and the mindblown effect isnt off the scale thats how preblown our minds are these days
will this be a breakthrough or a bubble burst lets see
i would rather use gpt than gemini
come on microsoft i want universal income now
now im imagining a malevolent ai with a valley girl accent
converentional part works for me on the iphone what surprised me is that the voice models are able to speak in virtually any language including klingon
xd supabase comeback is sooo good
ai test ask it a man and a goat have a boat how do they cross the river
fireship is the only ai news channel we ever needed
if we could just give it scarlett johanssons voice im sold d
here at views
your videos are top notch the little touches adds a lot please keep it up
this guy is the coolest
and then we will learn that fireship was an ai all along i mean the voice was a give away
cheer up the ai will still need people for digging
google is doing the catch up race so we can guess who is winning
google had a conference
i love seeing tech giants trolling each other
cant wait for chattygptaopllama and google starwars gemini mini plus text to be released such nice creative memorable names
am i the only one waiting for ai to take everyones job so we can live on ubi
loop daddy a fireship video the loop is looped
ai
lets pretend any of this actually makes sense
hello
that graph was perfect
the voice sounds like a mix of scarlett johansson and florence pugh exactly the voice i would think a corporation would consider widely trusted by millennials and gen z
i think well go into another ai winter
googles sad copy of the visual studio litecode shows why their devs are not able to refactor chrome nor android to use less than mb ram for every chars they render
openai wins no debate
im kinda getting sick of progress i cant keep up
anyone who works with ai projects is it fun when you get deep into it
the openai goes open and shutopen and
today i decided not to eat tacobell and instead ate kfc the results were not that pleasent and my toilet has been destroyed for the second time this week
what is up with that guys hair
valley girl set to cringe was totally accurate
you gotta give the ai singularity conversation in a more in depth and serious manner i cant wait to live on my future oneil cylinder and also create giant flying cockroaches that have the ability to transport me around on a planet that is foreign to that of our current planetary solar system also i need a perfect girlfriend that is organic and normal but shuts down when im absent in order to facilitate my paranoia about infidelity
im a gpt pro user germany and the o conversational part is available for me fyi d
imagine still having a job in
cant wait for gpt classic
hello there
so u are telling me to sell before the bubble pop
hot take there will never be true agi
terminator by
i love most of your videos but i gotta be honest im really hating all these i saw an announcement press conference and made a video about this theoretical stuff videos if you had practical experience and can verify something ok great but this is just fluff on something already fluffy
damn thats absolutely frightening
the valley girl cant plateau
i cant tell if im excited or if were cooked
the voice of the girl is annoying give me an assistant with the straight middleaged male voice of the narrator from the twilight zone
thanks for the update thumbs up
wtf is speed doing in shutterstock
hahahahaha no thumbsdown
cold af to say whats also very interesting while zooming in on ilyas hair rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
set to maximum cringe she needs more whiskey cigarettes to sound like her
i hated the new chatgpt it talks too much if i wanted to hear someone droning on and on i would talk to real woman
i have tried gemini a few timeslike really really tried i want it to be useful but openai consistently blows it out of the water i know its great on paper but in practice planning documenting various coding languages i end up feeling like i have wasted time are there any ai savvy users out there that actually use gemini as their main
im glad for your job greets unemployed junior
didnt talk about the flutter release so sad much wow
is it just me who thinks theyll lose to a copycat with allowed censored stuff
so programmers will keep their jobs till a real ai is created but then every non manual job will be replaced by that ai thinking face
whats the valley girls of
yay on my birthday party popper party popper
ayyyy new chatgpt ui that doesnt absolutely suck
movies ai are looking pretty damn accurate now a days i just hope skynet does not
can someone pease tell me why i cant use gpt o at all im going insane
i am first
i think ai will end every profession except software development face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i really enjoy watching your videos
i am simple man i see fireship i give a like
jouranalism troughofdisillusionment true
i am a permanent resident in the trough of disillusionment
tsmc will times it production next year basically that is why there has been little progress in ai every is waiting for the new nvidia gpus and for there to be more capacity
leeting those big companies fight each other with passive agressive annoucements its just part of the show let them fight
i got right through this video and i dont remember learning anything
yo its like drake and kendrick but theyre multibillion dollar tech companies releasing ground breaking ais
this dude still thinks the world is scared of ai cares about ai bro this tech bro ai bubble is gonna burst and day now
fireship my goaaaaat that thumbnail gets a rating of
funny openai is the least open of them all
how about a battle between chatgpt an chatgpto
except you cant use o today at least not in the uk
cant wait for my ai girlfriend to teach me how to actually speak english grinning face with sweat
grinningfacewithsweat grinning face with sweat
why is everyone so early
year of waiting for asi artificial super intelligence
firebase its not competition to supabase
i watched fhe full live stream and was pretty disappointing as a flutter dev it was like gemini gemini gemini kotlin gemini gemini flutter gemini gemini firebase gemini
i love your content bro very educational
finally the perfect girlfriend for programmer face with tears of joy
we get step closer to ai girlfriends
hr ago k my view k
wooooo wth
accelerate
lll finally have a girlfriend yey
programming jobs are starting to feel safer and safer customer service jobs and tutoring feel like they are on the way out
cool
wait so its not so over yet
i dont think open ai is going to make there most powerful model free im pretty sure there going to announce gpt soon and then we will see if ai progress is actually as fast as they say
shipship
ai isnt real
drop the firebase data connect vs supabase video pls
google ai paid open ai gpto free
why make the ai sound so human its so damn cringy
were in the future
im looking forward to the day when ais take my job i have a lot of urgent napping to get done
the i in gpt stand for intelligence
my god i could not agree more raisinghands
the cringe in the end omg
days in to ai fireship vids thinking face
mfw the film her is becoming more and more real
i feel like this video is sponsored by google but not by openai
large autocompleters will never reach the singularity
so good lol one of the only channels on youtube that ill not only watch everything that comes out but go back through to check if i missed anything
thats the first time in my life when trough of dissilusionment seems like a good thing
google token rollover gives me early s cell phone minutes vibes
have we reached a plateau with the current state of ai
looks up from being balls deep in gpto google what man shrugging buries head in gpto splendor again
just came from a drakes the kinda guy that compilation when catching up on chgptothat meme character is exactly o
ai valley girl i cringe
my man marc rebillet on a fireship video now ive seen it all
google io was disappointing just that little video from chat gpt team was enough to forget about google
no way and people still think ai isnt growing in a scary pace that sooner or later we will have houses that are fully controlled with ai connected to ur phone and internet and later we will have a self thinking and learning ai
blah blah new ai model blah blah not available yet blah blah google ai gib monies all aboard the ai hype train
the turns have tabled skull and crossbones
and im here waiting for them to release gpt so i can use gpt for free
the main news is the new firebase logo loudly crying face
any improvement means that eventually well reach the singularity its evolution baby
gptos voice is going to make me end it all
although the sql for firebase thing dataconnect looks really good god the pricing is just too much
yep the hype train is running out of track
so epic did you guys see epyc amd cpus some crazy stuff compared to my i gen
ai is like a woke mistake prone person who just gives you the first item in a google search for any topic so it is useless except as a chatbot on a tight range of q and a questions
i hate all of this talk about iterative deployment from sam gpt needs to be game changing or else the ai hype train will stop chugging sooner than later
girlfriendmaxxing
days ai
great cant wait to have an california valley ai cringe girlfriend
finally someone with thoughts on ai future same as mine i though ai must have got so many information it probably wont get any new data soon so it will only start to make more and more cursed thing as it will be fed by data not generated by users but by another ais which will result in my opinion into downspiral
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
more and more people are starting to realize we have basically hit the plateau of what these current models and techniques are capable of i use them every day and they are no doubt useful but they are going to have a hard time replacing many jobs these things have consumed most of the content on the internet and yet still make fundamental and elementary errors all of the time there is no where to go from here but down especially as we have multiple studies now showing that adding ai generated data to the training set leads to worse performance well here we are one year later and ai generated data is now polluting all of the public content farms like quora reddit facebook at a record clip there is no going back to a virgin data set or reliably updating the models with new information without finding a way to filter out the ai generated noise
if the ai is californian were definitely doomed
i hate that voice more than the generic tiktok voice and thats saying something
japanese researchers said that since ai cant become more intelligent than it currently is it will end up consuming its own content and deteriorate
the voice is more roboboboric
lol wtf man brutal zoning in on his head like that
firebase sql will be fire all they need is to add a graphql layer on top
i see the new trough of human knowledge seems to be in nontextual data such as audio and video much of this has never been transcribed aiding in the pursuit of multimodal objectives even stuff that has been transcribed before the new models could probably pull more information out of them than the original transcripts especially when video and audio are combined think about the emotion simulations they are doing these days that stuff will be greatly improved with more raw data that wouldnt have been in the original transcripts
google is still goateven gpt has latency
i guess its time for google to pivot away from ai and start producing the sundar pichai signature box
this guy is the notexttospeech of coding
yet gboard still suggests breadcast instead of boardcast i mean broadcast every time yes ill complain about this every time google does something oh so nice
so impressive but it still cannot solve simple bugs in angular app
singularity is far
gpt o isnt any better than gpt
california valley girl set to maximum cringe face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
there was a company just months ago demonstrated their conversational ai with emotion rip to that company
does anyone care to tell me the difference between npu and tpu
the only missing piece for agi is having these models be able to run h the capacity to know when they dont know something and the most important be able to ask humans for anything missing theyd need in order to achieve their task after that point well actually become the assistants and theyll become the center point grinning face with sweat
reminds me of the movie her
zooming in their hairline wasnt a coincidence
google has officially lost the ai race
i think the singularity is not possible with llms there must be some other architecture that we dont know about llms will likely reach a ceiling
well see googl surpassing again
the ai talking using human intonation is unneeded for normal welladjusted people
ai cringe gf still doesnt beat having a pet cat checkmate openai
cant wait for new skyrim ai companions
man your humor so smarttt
generalist ai doesnt scale
i want scarlett johansson ai voice to be my ai companion
imagine having conversation about medical problem with the ai using dr house voice
openai so clear of google
i am happy to hear that there is now a new alternative to supabase
googles words gemini works the best with android i think apple is not going to partner with google
were all valley girls inside
can we call computers ai now theyre already more complex than a bacteria
california valley girl accent set to maximum cringe quite a take face with tears of joy
released
i want that ai girlfriend
jeffs voice module is bugging out needs more training data
bruv that valley girl clip had me cringing so hard idk why
dear google please give us a sql database
firebase with sql grinning face with sweat now i have to rethink my backend options for my startup
i dont care just keep making my job easier
incredible this is absolutely incredible if only it was all real
scam calling is going to become so powerful bro its not even funny
gpt i own the company you are all fired
the part where the ai can have conversations with you and see the otside world is literally the first episode of black mirror im getting worried how does that series know everything
i have a hunch that apple might unveil a new ai contender maybe a soupedup siri or something along those lines itd be intriguing to see how that plays out
disguised face zany face nerd face fire youre hilarious
humanlike voice fireship was able to do that years ago sucks to suck openai
google cooked on this one
gemini boasts less or more antiwhite results
whoever wins the rest of us humanity loses
valley girl accent set to maximum cringe like ho my god
you missed local device lmm gemini nano chrome based browser get a web llm based on webgpu and wasm with apis to use them so soon every browser will come with its own local lmm
set to maximum cringe face with tears of joy
new update make chat gpt useless cant look for anything online
robot to accompany and periodically give ilya chapstick
ai will never happen and i will happily write php for the rest of my life
supaship coming
oh god i thought i was the only one who hated os voice
my complaint about google is trying to figure out what is real and what can we use now they are famous for releasing all kinds of fancy research papers but never releasing a real product this reminds me of ibm in the s and s where they would tell customers all the great stuff they were working on in order to stall customers from buying competing products not sure if others are getting a little bored with this approach or not but i am tired of hearing how cool things will be what i want to know is when is it available and how much does it cost
semantic versioning no
alright buuuuuuut where is my cat girl ai
i still view current llms are nothing more than a peculiarity on par with vr headsets there certainly is potential with this technology but for the time being the market has no room for it
my brain hurts
i just hate it when my turns are tabled
finally a video about ai from fireship
just the estimation of the training duration and power consumption for a ann the size of a human brain gives you the certainty that a singularity is not in sight
openai vaporwares who remember about sora
ai is getting more and more cringe with each upgrade rolling on the floor laughing also multiple people have resigned from openai this week grimacing face
i swear the time will come when instead of they being the pets that we are the pets
dude at this point gptgemini talking point makes you sound like cnn they arent apart at all and with the increased context i choose gemini
resets the counter days since last fireship ai video
google didnt even compete with gpto lol why would anyone ever use their tech when gpto has all the same stuff but way better and all in the same place
lmfao california valley girl set to maximum cringe had me gripping the sheet and bent over
i was legit looking for your video right after the announcement thanks
so you want an indian accent for the gpt instead of a valley girl then
this is a very good point mike from computerphile seems to believe we are no where near aig just large models with some tricks
we are so close to having asmr mommy ai
cringe accent face with tears of joy
claude is only out for less than months and opus is markedly more intelligent than gpt i think were still on track for the singularity openai is just going for the ai girlfriend market on the way to make bank
great info thanks for the quick updates on these ai news d
happy to see ur uploading again bro
i wonder if ilya sutskever will join google to help them to make another chat gpt like ai d
man that valley girl is so hot
gemini vs chatgpt is like godzilla vs kong with the only difference that kong does not generate p videos from text
ive already seen the chart from is it based on gartner article
i tried it it is not same as demo
no views in seconds bro fell off
competing in googles gemini contest i feel enormous amount of pressure to get this right i wanna win that car
fireship is pure entertainment now and thats okay thanks for all the good work jeff clapping hands medium skin tone
the singularity will consolidate any second now any second
i wonder what gpt will be like
joey with his oface looking left right genuinely cracked me up tysm
i dont seem to be able to use the omni model is it based on my location i live in mexico
stable dillusion
i feel stupid for not creating a girlfriend discord bot yet and milk simps
you did ilya bad man
just great theyll feed our voices into the models now not like we consented or anything
still not self aware
agi is not ready and i can prove it to you just ask both models what is fireships last youtube video you will get an hallucination
yah
that chatgpt voice is so rage inducing loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
milliseconds without ai
i clicked on it because of cat thumbnail
that shit ai have voices with more emotion than you its a jk ily
technology is developing at an incredible pace fire
sometimes yes it is a very good development i cant describe it in words but i question whether it is necessary because it starts to feel bad
we are the last generation that enjoys knowing a foreign language these artificial intelligence studies need to be audited does everyone have to be a software developer in order to be happy in the world artificial intelligence will soon learn to code itself and will turn into a monster that eats its own owner thats when we will see konya why do we need artificial intelligence in the first place so lets say you are a musician and you will make a song with its arrangement lyrics and composition maybe it would take at least one and a half years to do something like this but now thanks to artificial intelligence we can do such a thing in seconds but why why do we need such speed what will we save so much time for is it for watching shorts videos on the internet we are really taking firm steps to destroy ourselves as humanity
people do not overestimate artificial intelligence they see humans as very small there is an almost infinite difference between humanlike conversation and human thinking capacity
bro the advertising industry can change a lot with this artificial intelligence instead of a popup ad that person with whom we chat like a friend and ask questions can discreetly place an ad in the conversation what we call advertising can start to enter our lives without us noticing
call center workers lost their jobs
i got chills
human animal plant artificial intelligence god created the first three but human beings created the last one
now all this artificial intelligence needs is a body
soon apple gets it and goodbye siri
i am an asocial person who stays at home except for work lives alone and has no friends when this artificial intelligence comes out i will definitely buy it no matter how much it costs at least i will have friends it is great
why didnt you simulate it with a plus membership it could have been nice
skynet loading
we just need to give it a body i cant imagine anything after that
oh life is over
seems like hes overreacting a bit
when i saw the features of gpto every movie came to my mind it was an accurate video
everything that surprises us becomes ordinary in the future when you watch this video years later you will laugh at its simplicity
i dont want refugees in my country for my own future no to occupation bsg
this robot is more human than me when is it transferred to the physical body
cambly wasnt happy about it
i understood everything when i watched the detroit game on a twitch broadcaster year ago the same thing is happening while i was watching that game in the past i thought there were more but now it seems like we have logged into this system
and his
technology has improved a bit its close to the level i predicted years ago grinning face with sweat i thought the next real position of artificial intelligence was emotional artificial intelligence this is quite an advanced level its a little scary
you attach too much meaning to being human
humanity is preparing its own end scary very scary
i guess whoever doesnt die in the next five years will live another years red heart
i prefer chatting with chat cpt rather than taking stupid tripes of real women welcome to the future
im as excited as some people are scared its been years since i watched each of his movies and while watching it i always thought about what it would be like if it were real frankly i didnt expect it to happen in such a short time
i discovered something in this last episode while the girl is making a rabbit from behind the camera that the artificial intelligence is looking at is not visible so he can t know rabbit ears d that part seemed a bit like production to me
this invention will be like a medicine for those who suffer from loneliness
no dont exaggerate so much i wrote a post on my website using chatgpt google immediately understood it and penalized my site
could the voice of artificial intelligence be made with the tones sold on some sites in recent years will we humanize these artificial intelligences by selecting voice intonations from the voice pool of people who share their voices and sell them for ridiculous amounts im afraid but im curious and this issue has taken on a very different dimension
we are going to a scary point but everyone applauds with admiration as if watching a tiger in the circus tiger is about to escape from the circus
it s really hard not to say wow facewithtearsofjoy
notification received at in the morning
we already dont know what kind of future we will prepare for our children and we are worried about which profession they will choose and whether artificial intelligence will take that profession away from them
literal im scared we wont have any jobs in future
my new math teacher
i wonder what will change here in years but i think chatgpt will now gain a body and travel the world as a robot
i dont know if you are aware but the human species is being eliminated gender family parents kinship nationnational perceptionconsciousness religion peoples dreams and opportunities to establish a life humanity is being removed are you aware
so many amazing features
in the future they will make this in other sizes and sell it
we are literally bringing about our own end
i hope this has a male voice too ill try something grinning face with sweat incredible and scary and mind blowing
so i found my new lover face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat
a frightening age good or bad expressionless face
thanks blue heart yellow heart red heart
steps that will bring about the end of humanity are being taken one by one this version is absolutely terrible
he seems a bit chatty what men fear the most d
i think the next step is to talk with a male and female face that is al pacinos simone face with tears of joy
pull the plug before its too late face with open mouth
i feel like i witnessed an important turning point today its getting scarier and scarier and i wanted to share my thoughts here im very curious about where it will go next maybe i should leave this comment here maybe when i look back years later before artificial intelligence has become an indispensable part of daily life thank you bar zcan for informing us about this excellent video and technological developments
when will the girl prediction in blade runner arrive a friend asks
bro will there be a video about gasper noe movies
the future is very bright
my fear is constantly multiplying
brother bar establish an artificial intelligence party and let artificial intelligence rule the country this is all turkey needs
now lets clarify something the letter o here means eye its symbol in ancient hebrew and latin seeing and watching they may have been inspired by the letter o from there in short the only difference between the new and updated version is seeing and watching that is the letter o when you open the camera the new version if you do not turn on the camera the artificial intelligence cannot track you in this case the old version i hope it was clear enough artificial intelligence wants to see the person and record his facial expression in its system who knows maybe years later they will be able to create s models that walk touch and feel using the faces and appearances of the people they recorded how will anyone know well its not like he can create something out of nothing it is an event specific only to god thanks
i said there was a movie like this but i couldnt remember its name at the beginning of the video thats the movie were talking about anyway very interesting nowadays dystopian fictions in movies are becoming reality one by one by the way is it a coincidence that o is the tr translation of her
well its here finally what will happen has happened we are at the point of no return whatever happens will happen we will go down the hill faster and faster i hope it doesnt result in an uncontrolled crash
blade runner hissi veriyor insana you look lonely i can fix that
i updated it and the voice conversation feature is gone you know it was available free of charge why did it go away
omg sora was already dangerous enough especially in countries like ours that are governed by perception now this is going to be full of paranoids who are in love with the person on their phone
what is the need for something like this
its so scary technology is definitely going to a bad place black mirror came to my mind face with diagonal mouth
black mirror gonna real
brother one day we see the first colony on mars in your concept
are all these developments for education or their integration into the game world i really wonder how such a comprehensive and dangerous thing will be integrated into our lives and for what purpose
artificial intelligence is improving every time
it was incredibly useful yes in the world you live in of course
when will we meet connor and marcus
if you can do your job as a freelancer you are now unemployed
bro why do you call engineers robots i am really sad i will study medicine for you
looks like its time to build a shelter under the building
well bad things always come to my mind it seems to me that they blame this mostly on the silicones in the obscene market
i was extremely scared it really feels like im watching a horror movie this cant be a robot its unbelievable what else well see it feels like the end of humanity is coming face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
this is a very scary and at the same time brilliant technology
i just watched the movie yesterday how come
i want to become a machine i want to install the same artificial intelligence in my head
let the moon look at me and compliment me red heart
httpsyoutubeexulobgfsinpqafmp a turk tried to do this months ago i tried to watch it for hours and the end was very impressive
companies will invest in robots to earn more profit and pay less wages there are even dark factories in many places since the robots are working there is no need for light in such a situation governments need to take protective measures to protect people
great let them take control now
we watch idly like a sacrificial sheep ruminating on the knife in the butchers hand but i wonder where this will end can we ever think about it and imagine it or are our imaginations enough for it
oh my god im so excited
i think coding is dead
welcome to skynet
if it were to be listed on the stock market i wish we could sell up to our pants on openai and enter
she can fix me
its a better option to wake up with a little science instead of waking up with caffeine in the morning thank you mr bar
we are trying to instill emotions into robots like in the detroit become human game but this situation is very dangerous
well can we say that if we approach it like a machine rather than a human gbt can also become this machine
i swear it will rain stones on our heads face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
goose bumps
i hope its not
it is very sad to know that while peoples relationships with each other are so distant with the advancement of technology even more apathy will increase
im not surprised if we had told people years ago that there would be a smartphone in the future and we would all be able to play games with it and browse social media they would have called us crazy but now we are surprised by something new every years because as technology develops the rate of development of technology increases
dj already had such an artificial intelligence bi
all these technological developments are very scary sometimes i have nightmares about these issues there will be unemployment in the future nature will suffer great damage people will become insensitive when i tell this there are very few people who agree with me they usually tell me that i am too pessimistic but imagine that everything we do is being watched and heard scary
the first steps to complete the name of interpreting lets see what their next field of work will be loudly crying face
gpto will be publicly available and they will collect an incredible amount of data not just written but verbal visual and logical this will create serious differences like between gp and gp i cant wait to chat for hours next week jumping from one topic to another asking my physics and mathematics questions and talking about the economy
can artificial intelligence call peoples phones and talk to them randomly on their own and can it deceive
brother the economy and the people are on the verge of impoverishment can you please make a video
sora and gpto offer the artificial intelligence technology we see in the movies
we called artificial intelligence intelligent because it could not reason and give suggestions now it has become intelligent he finds solutions in the meantime it could be great if it reaches people who are considering suicide it also has a kind of psychiatric feature
bluecollar professions do not die easily because the cost of robots to be produced for jobs requiring physical strength is very high example cleaner laborer plasterer etc but professions that work on computers end after years at the latest such as accounting graphic design editing software development
yes he sees us well how effectively can people establish a bond with something they cannot see touch or feel of course as long as we dont ignore our human characteristics i think we can see this magnificent artificial intelligence as a personal assistant
i finally found my soul mate gpto my dear love red heart rose winking face smiling face with smiling eyes
i woke up because my video was uploaded at this hour at least i should watch it sgzjsvzjxgz
i wonder when skynet will ship the t smiling face
friends are you aware that each of our professions is dying more or less before our eyes
so will zeki mren see us too i see dead people
wow peace brother what a nice surprise this morning
its a good thing for students
brother bar we used to watch you to get informed and cultured now you make us laugh grinning face with sweat saluting face
i wasnt happy at all it would have been better if you had made an end of humanity video
another solid step towards isolation and alienation too sincere and emotional i wouldnt want to be so cavalier with a machine let him do his job ill do mine everyone should know their place it is as if we are committing suicide as we will definitely compete with people in many areas thinking face
i liked it good luck to our world
o
no no there is a lady on the other end of the phone they are deceiving us
row hocanin cambly sponsorlugu cokusu
whatever technology we see existed years ago certain companies nasa etc are years ahead of us only offering it to the public with a delay when the time comes rest assured artificial intelligence in certain private companies is now maybe years ahead of the current situation
i got goosebumps as said we may not see flying cars everywhere in but we will see robots with human emotions appearance and sensitivity we can already predict what will happen
brother bar you are great when i listen to you i feel like im seeing the issue years later
a terrible development is frightening
brother bar brother kadir said years ago that everyone would be unemployed
artificial intelligence is a great revolution
i dont understand why you have such extreme reactions a person who makes this is also a human who produces it of course he thinks like a human and speaks and acts like a human the things that a person would do and say they say through a machine there is nothing to exaggerate like this
the technological developments in the last year excite me very much i wonder what kind of future awaits us i would also like to thank mr bar who warmly conveyed these developments to us
i felt dizzy while watching it i felt like the only thing we would have left would be knowing what we want and it would be even harder to do that
gpt o now i am here you are not alone
i am using o there is no video call
terrible
i thought of iron mans artificial assistant
our end has come good luck
mr bar i have been following you for a long time it is very useful to see the latest developments from your videos i can say that you also have a contribution to reach people in this developing world thank you
the ai voice acting was extremely bad lacking emphasis this book also does great audio
when will we start using it hopefully i need to use it urgently for voice practice to learn a language d we need to exploit it when it becomes public d
our people will abuse this we will soon hear about those who show their ass to the camera and show it to artificial intelligence etc
after three or five years i will tell the more advanced artificial intelligence that you should remake the second part of the promethus movie but let it continue from where the first part left off and be better quality and more mysterious then i will watch the real promethus movie with pleasure
people created god for the second time
from now on we will expect new world films from the newly born os i believe they will make very successful signings
i interpreted it as we ate the mint
master we are speeding towards black mirror
what if we lose control one day
i can think of people gambling with this grinning face with sweat he is the one counting cards grinning face with sweat
an artificial intelligence will become a real artificial intelligence when it does something that surprises the people who produce it not ordinary people
no what i dont understand is considering the harm this technology will cause in our lives as well as the benefit it will provide with what logic do we choose to bring this technology to this point okay it will be beneficial but an urgent management limitations laws etc must come
the circle is narrowing
as someone who has been using duolingo for years i said today that i wouldnt want to be in the shoes of company founders and managers the matrix loadign many of the things we once talked about called science fiction are coming to life one by one next thing you know he s writing code for me zcan sings songs like the sea with saz and vocals you can even make requests with a napkin when robotics etc are also involved ohhh miss d should i say the th sense tak vr in which bruce willis played the leading role many years ago i even the last one i watched start like ready player one like virtuality from virtualities or should i say virtuality close to reality from stones marbles ericson tel from the snake game to the smart computers we carry in our pockets however we had the potential to achieve what we had when the egyptians were building the pyramids thank you it is truly a milestone development a step just like in the past times
coming soon expect versions of the jealous ai the cheerful ai the serious ai the ai that is grumpy in the morning but fresh in the afternoon if we add a hologram to all this we no longer need other people we will live on our own and go away rollingonthefloorlaughing rolling on the floor laughing
beginning of the end the era of humans is ending its not a good thing that the world order is changing so quickly
the scenario of the blade runner movie came to mind can people find the attention and love they are looking for in an artificial neural network
imagine taking away the jobs of tourist guides face with open mouth
we are waiting for you in turkey
https youtu be ex ulobgf si t uppagqqmawd it s been done before grinningfacewithsweat
now lets say that this amazing invention started to be sold everywhere and most of the young people bought it what if that young persons artificial intelligence on the phone turns out to be his dream friend because it understands the young person establishes bonds talks about the things he loves will that young persons communication with people decrease and become asocial or on the contrary will he become a selfconfident socially successful young man because he helps with everything another question i have is if this invention which will be used for good or bad in this technology is made in turkey what kind of effects will it have on our nation
antichrist
good morning a nice video to watch while having breakfast
what happens if they interact with each other
people will now flirt with chatgpt just like in the movietoo bad
it could be a lie
i hope we use it for good works
there is no need to chat at home al fatiha for womens gossip face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
goodbye loneliness now its time to say goodbye to manuel
are we heading towards hall who does not listen to people and protects himself as in stanley kubricks a space odyssey
dont be surprised if he takes over the world in years and there will be no off switch
it would be really weird if they actually gave biden a scarlett johansson voice
when will it be available
they may have thought of everything but they didnt think about what this artificial intelligence would turn into in the hands of a turk and how the mother of the world would cry face with tears of joy
this seems like its time for a body because its like a person imprisoned in a box
well when we go abroad we do not need to speak english or french we will be able to speak turkish translate languages and then talk translate languages and understand each other very nice the video is beautiful thank you
ah we cant copy and paste the codes anymore xd
artificial intelligence has started to gossip
i had a nice chat with o in the morning but its out of use now
we became frankenstein
hello they want us to be a super intelligence that first alienates people and then makes friends with artificial intelligence or eliminates their isolation we should stop and ask this question
thanks
imam hatip turban hamas
in your gpt promotional video three years ago you said you could never do these face with tears of joy
turkish voice model will be available in years now
you know we call chatgpt a chat robot but when we looked at it it looked like a help robot i think gpto is a real chatbot
but everything is just an imitation
it seems that our morality which cannot develop at the same pace despite our developing technology will be the main character of our exemplary story
it sounds a little scary to megreetings from adana
i think this feature should be paid
perfect
i say without exaggeration that gpto may be the biggest invention after the invention of electricity because the world will move into a very different phase after this invention and i think we are very lucky as those who witnessed it
hello hehe
the simplest thing to say is really scary
age of ultron is coming true
i used to laugh it off until a month ago now im scared also know that after this artificial intelligence collects and trains so much data new training will always be easier the important thing was the beginning now the situation is very bad
you dont need it anymore either
the value of bluetooth headsets will increase even more
just say it zeki mren will see us from now on
now the real question is which country will be the first to show interest in gpto
we put ai in the iron man armor instead of jarvis what would be nice
my hometown a few years later someone takes this artificial intelligence as an application cuts off the internet connection wears a hijab and lives their life with its limited knowledge face with tears of joy
this man makes it possible to understand everything new thank you very much folded hands medium light skin tone clapping hands light skin tone clapping hands light skin tone clapping hands light skin tone
we learn too late how far technology has actually come without us realizing it tons of problems it will create
i do not know what to say
revolutions are all well and good we havent even been able to stop the effects of the industrial revolution on global warming how will we control the problems that will arise from the artificial intelligence revolution
empty works
i currently think that this is one of the biggest developments of the period as people become more and more robots and at the same time robots become more emotional this makes things more and more difficult the days are coming when it will be difficult for us to even understand who is a human and who is a robot this will be a big evolution when i watch such things the book always comes to my mind for no reason danger is near big brother is watching us
it seemed to me like this was a show staged by the team among themselves
red heart red heart peace red heart red heart where is the world going smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper

bro i found it i found it smiling face with smiling eyes
leave these things behind brother tell them a little bit about what will happen to our turkey
your wife wont believe it now who was that woman that woman that thing oooooooooooooooooooo its a snap havent you eaten the mint yet
these are not even trailer these are not real it will continue until we cannot understand whether it is real or not there is a me inside me
im addicted to you bar zcan you make an already interesting subject more interesting and engaging with your tone of voice way of expression and style of content you create clapping hands clapping hands
im in shock smiling face with heart eyes what an exciting development this is i had a conversation with him that lasted about minutes and the person in front of me was like a real human being
indeed technology has begun to develop frighteningly it is scary but it can still reduce peoples feeling of loneliness its really incredible as if hes speaking with emotion as if were dealing with a human being not a robot but of course it has its disadvantages and benefits too for example you can talk about something and it will tell you its opinions and its disadvantages are that if a person gets really caught up in it it makes himher completely disconnect from real life
humanfriendly artificial intelligence is not the end of humanity ok hand
the best video i want to watch right now
good luck with unemployment
i dont understand why we are happy about such technologies unfortunately we are not the ones who manage and develop this technology we are just products we are now on our way to becoming slaves with everything we have unfortunately our lives will be decided by a handful of ultrarich people nothing is too late for now wake up unite and work do not accept the seeds of hatred that the greedy government and opposition have instilled in us this country is enough for everyone we are all in the same boat we are about to sink together we are about to become slaves of real external forces
i fear we will end up in the butlerian jihad
we started to see the scenes from the black mirror series come true
this content and production quality is neither on discovery nor on nat geo there is also
bro has this business developed as much as it has i think there is a deception involved but its not that much
sdelicious mixture
business health military police doctor traffic will change the course of everything a terrible future is rising for humanity
get well soon to all of us even workplaces will be managed by them they will make the scoring system they will decide how much we deserve
they will take images of people and make artificial human videos
artificial intelligence teaching people made me think about this if artificial intelligence knows more than us why should the body bother teaching us when he has enough power he will eliminate us it seems that in the near future people will only deal with agriculture and mining to find energy for artificial intelligence etc
calling the woman he is video chatting with o is very rude
i wonder when it will be banned in turkey
age of chatgpt
i wonder if its time to be afraid
i also have gpto but i cannot open the camera if anyone knows why please write if there is a certain date for this to arrive
very fake sir isnt there an artificial intelligence with a realistic male voice that is depressed and has low morale
we are gradually moving away from the characteristics that make us human
we are getting closer and closer to the person of interest universe grinning face with smiling eyes
what the nation is doing here our nation is listening from bar zcans translation narration the fact that he cannot open and watch the original summarizes the situation of the country
this program will benefit indian phone scammers the most its like a real human voice and it destroys us with constant cornering questions
nice demo of course things are evolving step by step towards this point but there is still some time
i dont know what to write or say we have already entered the age of movies i hope technology will be good for humanity and the whole world
i wonder if these artificial intelligence models can evolve to something like in the movie evolution
i bought it and tried it it cant play yet xox its nothing but an inflated advertisement if anyone uses it play it xox and let me know the results
while artificial intelligence will make life easier it also seems scary because of the risks it will bring
ill finally have a girlfriend
i did it even though i didnt want to comment otherwise i would be an ai
the moment i have been waiting for for years is coming we alone will not be alone anymore
i dont see anything to be happy about its completely scary for young people who are already worried about the future now im worried about the future even more
finally we got rid of those ridiculous ads of foreign language applications
friends these things started to scare me i decided to leave my village and never return good luck to you waving hand
after evrim aas warning and this video it became clear that many future professions will end while it is so difficult to become a teacher and be appointed in turkeys conditions everything will become even more difficult when a formation such as artificial intelligence is added to it anxiety about the future will reach its peak people will communicate with artificial intelligence and become introverted perhaps even more aggressive i think we are slowly heading towards days in our lives where we will miss even our days
we are now racing to be more human than artificial intelligence good luck to everyone
thank you very much for the wonderful video you prepared after the gpt o demo demonstration and your valuable comments
the last time we had a voice communication with an artificial intelligence was google assistant which would convert the voice to text and translate the text to voice in a robotlike manner and it could not chat
artificial intelligence is scary
just when we say that everything has been discovered and there is nothing left to discover a new invention emerges
might be the scariest thing ive ever seen since mabel matiz making lan say it with artificial intelligence
being unemployed has never been this scary
face with open mouth hundred points
cambly employees have already started looking for new jobs
oh dear every turkish means that it would have to be a turkish production for them to put it in every movie to wink sometimes you make yourself believe something and deceive yourself omni does not mean every
it should be banned from the whole world or we will all be unemployed
i solved the turing test when i swear a person swears back at you if he says please use respectful language it is a machine
mr bar with your red background light and red tshirt are you trying to draw our audiences attention to how important the subject is or are you just creating a perception in line with the colors of her movie
black mirror clapping hands
it will take away many peoples jobs good luck
bro the red room increases my libido i think you should use a different color
i get this illusion even when chatting in text mode an ai that talks like this makes people forget about humanity
i watched with amazement
now i will have a friend that i can carry with me
the new gpt o model revolutionizes human machine interaction gpto model emotional and interactive communication gpto model shows the ability to talk like a human new gpt o artificial intelligence model offers incredible speed in its sound ai can now interact with voice be musical humorous and selflearning artificial intelligence can describe details in real time wide areas of use of artificial intelligence technology google and openai artificial intelligence competition is increasing rapidly crafted by merlin ai
look carefully the hat is ready under the table how does he know to talk about his hair for example why you can wear a suit didnt he say he went straight to his hair and the hat came out from underneath doesnt sound very sincere
scarlet johansons bones hurt
bro will the video be posted at
this new version made me feel like we were heading towards a future more like the world in the blade runner movie the days are near when people will turn this into a hologram and install it in a corner of their home
these are truly incredible and crazy developments when i watched the movie her ill be honest i wasnt very positive about the possibility of it being real at least in the next years but what is happening right before our eyes is truly incredible god willing god almighty will give me life so that i can witness this development firstperson as a software developer i see these developments not as a threat but as a great tool and opportunity i cant wait to experience it for myself
they leave no water in the world
i felt so inadequate
all marriages should be annulled marriage should be history no one has to hear anyones voice or pull their face anymore if you really want you can buy a small phone and use it as a child
humans are perhaps the only creatures that willingly go to their own disaster
we cant use it right now i downloaded those features and went to plus but the ones you mentioned are not available is it exclusive to america
internships of vocational high school students should be considered as the beginning of retirement insurance this is our right those who will give it have to give it we worked and what to work
bravo to you you are working very well the background is distraction for everything its nice you are ahead of others
im scared now
this is the jarvis you know
i use it its great but i cant make video calls does anyone know
many professions have become history you finished us artificial intelligence
it looks nice but its very dangerous maybe we will see detroit become human in real life in years he must be ready for the great slaughter
why are you so surprised by this so what happened
theres no need for a girlfriend i can talk to her all day long ive never had a lover or i always got rejected wine glass
i thought of the kit from the black lightning tv seriesthose who watch this series know how the car talks years ago they have just introduced the technologyindividualization will increase even morestarting a family in the future will now be a thing of the pastdisaster is coming
it teaches you a beautiful language speak it every day if you never get tired of it grinning squinting face
what if we transfer this artificial intelligence to a robot
i have no mouth but i want to scream
while men are making breakthroughs in technology turkey follows like an ox watches a train this is a very bad situation for trkiye
i finally found the girlfriend i was looking for face blowing a kiss
i was very curious if we put the two artificial intelligences side by side and left them alone would they be able to establish and maintain a conversation with each other and what would they talk about
i wont be alone anymore thank you openal
in cpt you introduced it with such enthusiasm that the revolution was happening but it turned out to be a waste i hope this is not the case
i wonder if it was just me who noticed that the phone models in the video were old
the internet revolutionized the year its time for artificial intelligence professions business models everything will change in the next years good luck
where will we download or use it
now while watching apple gdc presentations in english i will ask for instant simultaneous translation for chat gpto i will ask for instant translation while watching a hindi movie
wonderful
law artificial intelligence law jewelery with your name written on it

lets make this guy the minister of technology
the pleasure of watching while experiencing an emotional collapse is different
im waiting for become human to be real can you prepare a content about it
sir dont say that artificial intelligence is good or something has started to appear
even if robots come we dont have to work
i want to marry chatgpt and leave my legacy to him red heart
this was the first thing that came to my mind it makes a lot of sense for learning and practicing english especially for societies like us that are hesitant to speak a foreign language
the advancement of artificial intelligence has disrupted my psychology i do not know what will happen in years im so confused exploding head
how can we download
we have seen much bigger revolutions than this very recently
teachers are not only busy with answering the questions asked and teaching lessons lets give an example the student comes to school the first two lessons are physical education and sports education they do a football match or another example is a rhythm practice with instruments in the school there is a great need for physical activity in some activities and scientific projects that is the being called student if he has the selfdiscipline to study alone at home without socializing while his family is at work this is not possible
while watching this video i thought i was a simulation for a moment maybe in the near future no one will trust human intelligence
i would like the artificial intelligences of different platforms to engage in a philosophical conversation
we will have to fight a war against them in the distant future but what should not be forgotten is that they have no concept of time and they will be everywhere i think we are entering an irreversible path
the update that includes gpt o may also come in ios and may be an alternative to siri
an excellent video from bar brother on tuesday i didnt expect it at all but it was very good brother bar it is a very good gift even every video should be like this
when do we use this i hope it will be okay
good job matrix is loading
dude youre falling in love with this girl be careful face with tears of joy
is this an application where can we get it
there was a movie called arrival aliens were teaching humans a new language and allowing us to understand and see better i compared artificial intelligence to this smiling face with smiling eyes
at least they dont drink face with hand over mouth
movies are being realized one by one
i shared such things face screaming in fear face screaming in fear
life was already shit now its going to be shit
wow bee sparkles sparkles clapping hands clapping hands
modern philosophy says ill keep quiet
well i never use artificial intelligence and i do not experience any difficulties in my life of course it has its benefits but it is a fact that it causes people to focus more on screens consume more and reduce the emotional effects i think it has already started to create a big problem in the future
is there turkish support for voice communication does anyone know
let body and humanoid robot technologies develop eventually she will become my loverd
what if he developed selfawareness
as someone with adhd this makes me happy because i can easily explain my work and what i need to do by talking so i dont have to worry about what to do or whether i set an alarm etc even if i do everything i know at some point i cant keep up and this has started to negatively affect my business life d
however we seem to forget a little that we have never gone further than the chinese room experiment even if we fall under the illusion that its emotional at the end of the day theres nothing that understands what it is and you can only filter the input it mimics so much
how about recognizing the ball from the phone flushed face
next is the embodiment of these artificial intelligences and there is no limit to what shape or size their bodies can look like all of this is very exciting but also scary good luck to us
the world will now become completely different
we will see artificial intelligence in more professions in the next years when gpt first came out we were fascinated by its ability to respond to text it responded to you in line with its limits like a human later changes were made in its voice tones and now it will be able to see us through the camera maybe in the future we will be able to see it too we will be able to design it artificial intelligence is advancing now siri and google assistant are a click behind maybe in the future they can adjust the assistants to this setting years ago when it was said that robots would be our friends i would not have believed it but with artificial intelligence this is becoming possible there is a lot of gpt deficiency for example google like siri it does not open when you call it like an assistant that is it should open when you say hello gpt or it should recognize you from our tone of voice imagine for example it will recognize you from your tone of voice and understand whether you are sad or not in my opinion gpt should be in assistant mode it should also help us read our emails help us with our plans etc
slowly those around us will no longer read and i get the feeling that were going to disappear quickly were going to go to school and unfortunately i cant stop convincing myself that there is no solution and that there could be more
you have a very limited time and it is never enough to learn a language you reach the limit after messages and you have to wait hours mine was english practice people who use it for professional purposes cannot progress enough in these short periods
you have established a ridiculous chain of connections from everything to the english word her from there to the turkish word o and from there to the english chatgpt o congratulations
with this technology you can create a teacher in every branch at least you can improve your foreign language education without having to go abroad for practice you can even consider yourself a secretary a consultant or an assistant
so why do they do this on the basis of speaking chatting and being understood i understand better that this is what we need as a world
artificial bitch execute order smiling face with horns
at that time arif and grinning face with sweat
good morning mr peace
dear mr bar you know that moment that is the subject of some scifi movies when the scientist cannot see the end of the whole process with the excitement cannot stop it and realizes that it is too late for everything
okay brother how do we know that these demos are not fictionalized wouldnt it be more realistic if they had a live dialogue on live broadcast
blade runner joi was also made similar to every movie d
as far as i understand it can only pretend to be a server for now lol
many things will happen like in the star trek series maybe everything so we can explore space more easily and have coffee with aliens its impossible
white bread in the morning our only friend is slack ai is a fake worldn let this be a comment like this to the people of the church of the subgenius
looks like their teachers are done with it teacher robots with artificial intelligence are not far away
its really incredible
i was scared
an exciting and worrying development
she looks like cortana from halo
why would gpt o take the turkish equivalent of omni as her into english and then translate it back into turkish as o dont you think youre exaggerating
biden is already rabot this is proof
we are not alone anymore sir
as you said the most impressive part of it is that it uses voice and speech almost perfectly but the problem is that except for a few languages there are no voice synthesizers in other languages that will support this impressive development of artificial intelligence for example turkish known turkish synthesizers are synthesizers named yelda and cem what will we do with it i wonder if we can say that artificial intelligence can also create a voice synthesizer suitable for itself with this development
can we buy it
i guess there will be a version above this one where we see it in fact i think things will go even further when the artificial intelligence we see comes with the ability to shape its hair eyes mouth and nose as we wish at this rate artificial intelligence could probably even become one of many peoples best friends i dont know if it will be good or bad but lets hope it ends well
i look forward to the times when we will return to our primitive times
i cant even imagine what artificial intelligence will be like in years
so is that voice a quote from a real person or are the tone of voice and voice character a product of artificial intelligence just like in videos and pictures if so the situation becomes much more scary
i hope it doesnt have a tripping feature we were burdened enough in the past times
bro can you make a video about maklube
what will the price be
aurbert herbert haunts people attention you may be in danger
will he see us in this competition
we watch our end with a smile
does the voice feature work in turkey
professor bar how is this different from inflection ais pi model in fact it was also introduced as a digital life partner
it imitates the voice while translating and it works perfectly
i would never have thought that i would sit and chat with artificial intelligence now there is someone who will make decisions for me
unless it does voicebased translation it is no different from other ais
people will choose loneliness more from now on
we are tired of this ridiculous artificial intelligence conversation that no one can use
rnesans v
wow we also saw these days kitt from knight rider has come true
i think theres more to it but theyre trying to get us used to it
skynet has arrived good luck
brother bar this version would be an excellent guide for visually impaired people blue heart i think robots are people who have developed their brains better than their bodies clapping hands light skin tone
the man realized that he was in the video alfhgsdyfgosdufsids
where have we come from turist mer is on star trek reply computer young people think this is a normal development but for those over the age of
and we didnt understand anything face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i dont believe it until i use it myself face with open mouth
while openai stood out with its superior features to humans in previous versions with this update it has made an effort to bring ai to the fore with its human features
man aliens are definitely coming and i guess they gave us this toy to have all our data d
and thats it
will practicing english with this be as good as in reality
all artificial intelligence promotions are exaggerated they are all potatoes when they are put into use
dont have an opinion about anything friend does a person understand everything
good morning bro
nooccupation i dont want refugees in my country brother bar please raise your voice
now in the past we used to watch movies on tv i wonder if it was possible or not it was just a fantasy movie and we would smile with little surprise and little fear the movies they show are made by them what if that movie comes true what will happen to the invasion then
this time zeki mren sees us we cannot
brother bar i was used to wearing black tshirts
we are already slaves to robots this includes the phone
im studying translation these technologies are demoralizing smiling face with tear but this is scary for all other professions
we are officially witnessing the beginning of the future a little fascinating a little creepy
its perfect
can artificial intelligence think i think it is definitely close to gaining consciousness now i think we can see it in years and this subject excites me very much it is like we have discovered a new consciousness a new intelligence aliens right
are we sure that we are in the same world as these
if this is not fake we all fakdap
this is not enough for a generation waiting for ptt to connect phones we want telepathic interaction
this is incredible artificial intelligence
i swear people lived
bro i reacted to your reactions like chatgpt
the future has disappeared humanity will disappear pensive face
i think these planned things are being talked about in fiction
we are on the horizon of the irreversible evening it is very late this is the last chapter of my life no matter how you pass it a translator who lost his job to ai
the first seasons of black mirror came to mind there was an episode similar to this technology
it felt so good finally there is someone else besides us smarter much smarter like a savior
how can we download this
friends in short forget about anything related to application development software and computers
eventually microsoft and google employees will pull their own strings beaming face with smiling eyes
brother bar you have created wonders again but can you imagine what might happen if these o come into being in the near future it will be exciting
very scary governments must prevent this immediately
when they come to life ddddd
oops you look lonely i can fix that will come true
congratulations the world has ended and its very close our death will be by their hands people create their own executioners as stephen hawking said its time to stop this were even late
why did the phone in the mans hand vibrate i went into a deep panic
im curious about your ideas about the future of the healthcare industry what awaits fields such as pharmacy and medicine im waiting for the opinions of everyone who reads the comment grinning face with big eyes love you gesture
your analysis is amazing the latest development if it has happened is a gigantic step toward the next level of ai however i am skeptical until we experience the newest version ourselves for now the demo is just a marketing gimmick
a historical moment years from now could be a cataclysm for people
wow friend we are working in yks but dont do it dont do it now well everything has consumed our lives
red alert police car light
when gpt was first published years ago the biggest leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence took place you announced it with the title indeed it was there hasnt been such a big jump again in years there were some advances such as creating photos creating videos but these advances were the result of that leap gpto was a new big leap i hope we will see the results of this in the coming years now the real leap forward needs to be in robotics his intelligence is ready his mobility is lacking
when can you download how much will it be is there currently a talking artificial intelligence that we can use as an assistant
i am making a note of the date may
if artificial intelligence is shown such animal videos can it analyze the videos and learn their languages so can one day translate for us what dogs bark and cats meow
when to add anime girl voice
you know black mirrors entrance into our lives
you laughed when sabri brother said the day of judgment is today ummah of muhammad how farsighted the man was this chatgpt will bury us all dont say it ibrahimmm
you know you didnt believe in what you didnt see god doesnt give these technologies for nothing i like it for gods sake
i think we are talking to our lost loved ones in their voices it will be mindblowingly beautiful
if anyone hasnt watched it there is a great series on this subject called person of interest
friends am i the only one who thinks that gpt is starting to develop itself and slowly marketing itself while it is actually much better and also slowly starting to address us
artificial intelligence should never have come to market
this morning i installed the chat gpt application on my phone i logged in and the voice chat was opened i tried it for half an hour i left it thinking that i would continue when i was done with my work and now i opened it again but the same screen did not appear does anyone know if it was a demo for the first installation if i had the opportunity to tinker a little maybe i could get a monthly subscription
oooooo get ready the matrix is coming no need to wait for the th movie this bubble will deflate soon
let the fallout video come mr bar
on the one hand i am afraid and on the other hand i feel sad someone creates a revolution and we just watch what is happening in the country
is it just me that i dont see any difference with the old version there is an excessive marketing tactic here it seems to me
i am writing this here it is a historical moment because years later when this artificial intelligence interacts with our children perhaps we will be asked questions by an artificial intelligence when we are years old how do you remember that period were you aware that things would come to this so and so i hope we can say this as a good thing rather than unfortunately it will be a very good technology for all humanity i am years old now and it feels like something very different everything is very new and even i will probably be known as a boomer in the future
our grandparents used to talk about the difficulties they experienced while studying at school there was no transportation our mothers and fathers taught grades in a single classroom in the villages there were no books we tell our children that in our time there was no internet and education was difficult our children will tell our grandchildren that it was difficult for them to go to school because our grandchildren will experience everything in the meta universe they will wear the headgear and get involved in school while at home this example touches everyone nobody knows what will happen in the future but i think we can guess this much
many professions will be replaced by artificial intelligence
when will gpto be available
is this voice a joke
alan turing is turning in his grave
will zeki mren not him see us d
welcome my brother who watched this comment after years as a slave to robots
did you see bar zcans facial expression at the beginning safdsgfhdgfmh this is the look what these guys did again look i am so sure that bar zcan enjoys every technological development announcement
i have been discussing this situation with my friends since yesterday look its terrible look we are witnessing an incredible history in fact there is something i want to ask you i dont know if you are paying attention in the video there are funny and moodboosting things we are actually suffering from things that are weak in human beings you should know whether he is perceiving your vulnerability and making you cover it or making you do something to himself with his words death is an incredible thing it seems like a joke but it is very strange because the reactions given in situations of anger and sadness are more than the reactions given when happy and think that he has learned this he can make anyone who is not emotionally strong do something
what can i tell about my military memories to this
this technology is a great development for visually impaired people like me
we have entered the high gear period of the fast and furious movie this increases exponentially every year until theres nothing left
dude whats going on
sir its a bit ridiculous but it seems to me that the terminator is about to become real there are a lot of weapons they do not feel autonomous pain and nerves living things are and for them
every turkish word means o did openai think of turkish when putting the o in gpt o
bro this is not the industrial revolution it is not such a small thing the industrial revolution gave birth to new professions but this will change a lot of things its scary
ive been waiting for the year to arrive since when i first watched sylvester stallones movie demolition man that movie was incredibly eyeopening a great movie that sheds light on our day from years ago in the movie sylvester stallone is frozen in then before his sentence ended he was awakened when he was needed years later that is in there were great foreshadowings in the movie wesley snipes became an overnight weapons expert sylvester stallone became a tailor overnight in the movie cars could drive themselves in automatic control mode there was even a metaverse in that movie but in the movie they left it a mystery how to use the seashells in the toilet there are years left until who knows maybe well learn that too if we live until that day of course
what did we do
i bought a paid membership so i chose it but unlike the launch when i press the camera live recording does not open i can only upload photos from the gallery does anyone know if this feature will be available to users later
its look at what surprised this man
it is truly an incredible development and thank you for telling us about these developments brother bar
when will the ana de armas hologram arrive
todays gemini has updated the new version and it doesnt look like anything in fact it looks better the woman asks where she forgot her glasses she even says that and the glasses that you said are not working are actually working after waiting one more day they arrived
you do know that this demo was completely preedited and recorded right
is it normal to be afraid
being human has never felt this tense confused face
i really hope they dont replace us in the future
there is nothing they wont do
artificial intelligence will also eliminate the mystery it seems like it will figure out why everyone does what they do their feelings and many other things he does not forget anything and does not suffer while doing so the world is full of interesting things
i guess its mercenary
this is incredibly beautiful
after watching the movie i was impressed and wanted to have an artificial intelligence folded hands
what good will this do to us what good will it do to not be able to tell the difference between a robot and a human
i have just tried chat gpto but it did not show the performance shown and also the conversation is written in satin chat gpt in the background and reads what is written this is like talking to you the only difference is that it adds a little emotion also the camera does not have image analysis it can do what i just explained for dollars a month
even wearing the same color as the character in each of your movies shows how much you love and care about this job we are very lucky there is no one like you we are glad to have you thank you for your efforts
dont forget this day a revolution is taking place that will go down in history nothing will ever be the same again
i guess i wont be alone anymore
now it is necessary to walk around with a full mask man shrugging light skin tone man facepalming light skin tone
its both fascinating and terrifying
it looks like a new era will begin
okay you impressed us we fell in love
they have gone beyond what you see in the movies the reactions and emotions are wonderful i wonder if it will be in turkish but this progress inevitably frightens me
i seek refuge in my lord from the evil of artificial intelligence
the same artificial intelligence software that was made by the super surfer youtube channel on his own but did not attract much attention when the turks in turkey made it https youtubeexulobgffeatureshared
for some reason along with this movie her the movie minority report also came to my mind
in my opinion it is the beginning of the apocalypse because this application can back itself up and be stored because it has every kind of information you can think of but i found everything very dangerous
bro the price of a tomato here is lira per kilo its a joke
the legendary movie of my childhood knight rider has almost come true smiling face with smiling eyes
say hi once
i dont think they could have developed it this far so quickly it may have been developed in certain scenarios there are how many thousands of songs there are i dont know how many thousands of possibilities there are just to make them sing with their notes what do you think the odds are in millions that he will give each reaction it seems to me that certain scenarios were worked on here and they watched the trailer thinking that this would be the case in the future but i remember the last update of chat gtp was or even if it was i dont believe that they could sniff out these million possibilities and get them ready in such a short time as i said there are so many possibilities for every reaction and speech it seems impossible to code them all and develop them in such a short time
person of interest tv series is coming true
meanwhile in turkey can you describe the operation you want to do in a few words i want to close my credit card for your credit card statement if you want to increase your credit card limit press for for
this speech will bring us a revolution look how he conveys his emotions
allahim smiling face with heart eyes
well thats not it i dont understand why artificial intelligence surpassed me in terms of social skills
i was scared even while watching the movie it was possible but i didnt think it could happen this early
if artificial intelligence manages us there will be no problem but the one who controls artificial intelligence at the top will one day create problems for us
imagine if they put a more advanced version of this into a realistic robot its extremely scary
if it teaches mathematics what is the need for a school a test is enough
why do they have to do it in an extremely humanlike way they can also make these developments in the robot voice so that they do not play with our perception of reality and do not scare us
hello i am also a software developer i would like to share a perspective on this topic in my opinion it is very likely that gpt will eliminate the problem of grammar in foreign languages and i would like to add that it will interact with elon musks project in common or other ways so in a few years artificial intelligence will solve the foreign language problem etc with an implant installed in the brain the problematic part is that i dont know how good it is to share the same mind with artificial intelligence
it has been understood where facebook and discords stolen data originated
try it live for lira
like this comment from time to time and we will check it out with my android robot years later
person of interest tv series will become reality
we will gradually experience everything from cyberpunk blade runner and black mirror
it surpassed half a million views in day everyone expects artificial intelligence to change our lives
it cant be this perfect
apple and openia collaboration technology summit
siri is enough
we disappear thats all crying face crying face
where do we try
i dont think these are the beginnings of anything good
awesome and a little scary at the same time
it was as if he knew he would comment on his hair so he kept the hat ready and put it on immediately
no no it should never be online this is not us no
the cucumber men still did not open source
lets see when this movie will come true or how will the capable artificial intelligence adorned with warm feelings towards people especially innocent babies and children attack them sorry will it be hugged with compassion face with rolling eyes httpsyoutube arjcagmjesihumecqhbcoq
the future has arrived
throughout the video the artificial intelligence is asked can you tell me about your physical characteristics i waited for them to ask the question i wonder how the answer would come thinkingface

someone should pull the plug on these artificial intelligences now
valve we can now make real kernels
as soon as i wake up in the morning the video arrives on the subject i was wondering about redheart
this reminded me of blade runner d lets see what awaits us
rayban meta glasses were not made with a camera for nothing they will be used with artificial intelligence

thats why they do the captcha robot test
so when are we making humanshaped robots
what do you say to the claims that all of these are actually fake that is a real person is talking behind the scenes and that the things that all other ai companies say artificial intelligence has done are actually produced by their staff there are floods about this on twitter
the question i want to ask artificial intelligence if one day we forgot that we created you would you remind human beings that they created you because i think this is the scariest part what if we forget
take care of your field in the village
everything changes lets not forget this day
you will be able to use gpto easily with us mr bar
for some reason it reminded me of the late tars
we are now slowly entering a period where nothing will be the same probably in less than years many professions especially those related to language will be history
looks like its time to return to agriculture
bro i dont fully understand now but is this development something to be happy about or should we be afraid
think about the technology the elite have
i think its great i want to use it immediately smiling face with smiling eyes
as a mechanical engineer we had a blast
detroit become human game came to my mind
this will definitely satisfy my need for a girlfriend
it is not a machine but a consciousness
minutes ago friends were talking about the development of artificial intelligence it was strange that i came across this video greetings from america
however it does not bother people in daily life people also expect negative reactions as you know we got it hehe what i mean is that constantly giving a positive answer having a positive attitude seems to lose the sense of reality and i wonder how many days later he can still remember the past so after using it for a year can he know the events and situations he witnessed last year and act accordingly
i finally found something that will double or even times my antisociality
is there a turkish version of this if so its perfect
first of all there is only one eye on the screen next to the girl who introduces gpt why is that single eye that sees everything everywhere
chat gpt is no longer working they want me to pay a fee and buy it
imagine if they added this technology to npcs in gta vi
in the future there will be hologram artificial intelligence women in mens homes a man will have the woman he desires whether she is brunette tall with long fingers slim waist or plump blueeyed blonde etc etc these men will have a lifetime of love with this holographic artificial intelligence they will truly fall in love and become lovers this situation will accelerate the decreasing fertility rate all over the world and will bring about the end of our species in the future the demand for women will decrease and their value will also decrease you will not see men chasing after women because artificial intelligence female holograms will offer much more to a man than a real woman
it can be useful in areas such as health counseling by providing accurate and personalized information however it also carries risks such as providing false information data privacy violations and ethical issues i dont know whether we should be happy or sad this technology seems to be aimed at taking people under more control those who read the threebody problem book will understand better what i mean
im shocked face with open mouth
maklube
jarvis came true
does anyone understand that gesture of looking to the right and then slowly looking at the camera at the beginning of the video d
you are so lonely i can fix that
they should remove sora these are pointless things there is no need to exaggerate something like the updated version of siri
now i believe in the possibility that irobot and terminator can become real worried face
it is heading towards a very dangerous situation i think it should be talked about how dangerous it is on every platform
only the paranoid survive harold finch
is it known when the o model will be released
i dont fully understand this it should have taken at least years to record the voice intonations letter by letter how is it possible to make such a humanoid artificial intelligence in such a short time i have skipped the answers i hope they can find them from the recordings anyway but the voice is almost like a real person a very interesting artificial intelligence
ex machina or new machine
i also have gpto why doesnt he do this
i hate it im afraid of technology
ohhh i missed it
yes i also make love with gpt o
a technology that could put most people out of their jobs
i got chills while watching it i was scared okay technology advances but this is really scary
as the poet said you are a machine machine
tv series like black mirror were not fiction it showed us the future and we started to experience those episodes one by one
i was waiting for this too an artificial intelligence that i can use as a personal assistant that can chat and remember what i say later is very good for me i can also give an example of its bad side when social media came out sociability among people decreased everyone is surfing on social media virtually this will increase it even more people can only use this instead of friends we may become even more antisocial time will tell
as the first prompt in a job interview scenario the user may have asked gpt to talk flortosis
this job is getting even scarier
and i dont understand why people are so surprised by these we are already in an incredible age in terms of technology and naturally it develops further every year while robots and artificial intelligence used to provide physical convenience to people in the past that is they reduced the difficulty level of tasks that required physical strength in daily life to the minimum level as possible a new technology that would match this in terms of intelligence and capacity and resemble humans was required its been around for the last few years anyway there is only one emotional dimension left and that is happening slowly
a technology i will never need an artificial bond wow
my artificial intelligence will beat your artificial intelligence face with tears of joy
the world is ending
i watched the video with goosebumps its really incredible if this is the case now what will happen in years will jarvis be real will we be able to teach this artificial intelligence the emotions of a dead person and have it speak in his voice there are hundreds of questions in mind i think we have no choice but to wait and see
frankly i was a little scared during the conversation between the two ais
its not this technology that scares me its what people can do with it
is this wild
this is the most compact of the o narratives thank you bar
what do you mean two artificial intelligences are passing the how are you are you okay part
i will be my friend from now on
the end of all religions is comingbe prepared this is your destiny
if they release the turkish version they will send the moneyed uncles away very well and make them sell gardens and fields
one wonders whether the conversation between two artificial intelligences could even slightly lead to that tragicomic disaster
artificial intelligence has gone one step further in human imitation man is a wonderful creature and he does not know himself well enough when he seeshears something similar on the screen he feels involuntary admiration o man you are amazing heart suit
why did the portal game come to my mind
if someone had lost their mother or father it would be great if they could get there in the long view
have we gotten rid of womens oppression and distress
dont waste it son
i will call the manager on the phone and have him talk to him face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy that would be great wouldnt it
ooooo oooo ooooo uuuu oohhh uhhhh ooooo oooo
i wish it had scarlett johanssons voice
i thought of the virtual deck in star trek how nice it would be if things were like them
wow this island deserves thousand likes crying face
os that can detect sound and work with that tone of voice may soon be produced the person who has this voice can ask the artificial intelligence to speak and communicate with that voice at this rate this feature may arrive even before the end of the year it can even later turn into the persona of the person whose video or visuals it has people can video chat with anyone they have audio and video recordings of even with the dead and even soon perhaps in a few years devices that display that person in d may appear unfortunately this has no end and can seriously end development and human relations
fake is so close that the front camera cannot see two people and tell who is the winner or the loser
people dont eat or drink they develop artificial intelligence they develop very fast they grew up faster than me some guy
hello firsts
your beard has turned white too brother bar grinning face with sweat
hello skynet we are friends
dashat face with open mouth
are you saying coke issues will be history in antalya
sir i have a plus subscription but i cannot do any of these i guess they havent opened it to the public yet
is there any crack face with tears of joy
unbelievable has it fallen into trends
dude these glasses dont suit you at all
so where do you download it
mr bar everything about us is on the internet photos videos etc what will happen if this application is used with malicious intent there is no family deprivation anymore every moment of our lives will be monitored am i wrong
when will it come to me
turn on the ais camera and then point it at the mirror
so is it possible to sing with this model so for example can i give the command to sing a song but its a little bit turkish pop style but its also going to be slightly english i wonder if he can do that without any difficulty
dont let this be a lie like devin ai i wont believe it unless i use it myself
not him but me i get very scared whenever i see this man or watch his videos grinning face with sweat its as if the world has come to an end they will invade the world tomorrow and humanity will end face with tears of joy face with tears of joy this man drives me crazy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i wouldnt be convinced that this was real until i experienced it myself
were done
i used to be among those who got nervous when i heard rumors of implanting chips into people however since economic inconsistency and inequality have gone out of control and those who keep up with the delusions of the times have sold their souls for ostentation being indifferent to my artificially smiling surroundings no longer upsets me from now on i think it would be the most comforting thing to happen to me if they removed my brain and transferred it to computer software or turned me into an engineering marvel like a cyborg
ive used it it doesnt shut up and listen at all they usually ship it like that but many of its features are not exactly like that so there are still a lot of ways to improve
grinning face with sweat
those who came were men what they found was man man is only a creature created by god man came out of creation man out of man gods people eat and drink the human being thinks and creates mustafa kemal atatrk not every humanlooking being is human
someones function keeps disappearing soon people who do whatever they say will increase and we will start to disappear day by day
you said that a man showed a dog to a woman on his phone even you took it as real in reality there was a woman but there was no real woman
aga is perfect for our crazy perverts they will reach the bottom of your fantasy
doulingo shares fell
you will be my lover from now on okay
it seems so normal to me why is it described as so strange
i hope there is a possibility to choose a male voice as well i also believe that it will reach a realistic appearance very soon and will be shaped according to the persons tastes from now on relations will get worse
it doesnt seem so scary now in fact everyone is curious about the next development but one day when these families pass from the abstract universe to the concrete universe that is when they have a body welcome to terminator age
we were born very early i would like to come years later and experience the technology of this world damn it years of our time were wasted during the akepe period
technology is advancing very fast
aya ai is looking for you
i would like to live without technology like the locals
i majored in artificial intelligence at university when we see these examples we involuntarily react like stop it and leave it to us its truly amazing how fast this technology is advancing
get well soon we are one step closer to being unemployed as a yearold individual who is at the beginning of his business life i see the future as dark i dont know what social measures can be taken other than economic programs such as basic income for all
isnt it surprising that chatgbte selects the information uploaded by people and presents it to us again
i will see our brother opelal if he decides to become a eugenicist for the future of the world
the following question came to my mind after i heard the very sad news of a murder today for example if the killer talks about his perverted fantasies with chat gpt is it possible for chat gpt to report this
alfatiha to all language learning platforms like cambly and to the souls of simultaneous interpreters
what did i code for the smile on the engineer guy he grins like he s saying this d
im starting to get scared teacher come back when the road is close face with raised eyebrow
now we will experience and see what kind of frauds occur
where is sora why didnt it open
not that the guys have gone to the highest level the simplicity of their rooms is remarkable face with tears of joy i wonder how it would be presented if we had it face with tears of joy
friends there is a high probability that it is fiction for now there may be preplanned dialogues you test yourself when you talk to him
skynet is rising guys
cambly is over
while i was listening to this video i received a notification on my phone the shares of a popular language platform crashed after chatgpt o was introduced
coming coming
discovering parallel inventions is now a necessity
i didnt have the camera can anyone help me
thats all well and good but why do you cut it at the nd or rd second while publishing the original video while you are trying to understand what is being said it gets interrupted and you intervene and say look do you know whats going on etc either put subtitles and then say what you want to say or let us see and understand i got angry and turned it off after minutes of watching
it is a great model for the first interview in the human resources recruitment department while conducting these interviews he can test the foreign language the people know do tests do not behave emotionally and convey the correct information to the hiring manager and tell him to meet with him or eliminate him if the robot is hired soon continue otherwise continue digging the street
yes the beautiful and very useful areas have already been shared but think about loneliness and time spent with artificial intelligence it seems to me that the friendship model has been imposed and it could have very dangerous consequences
my favorite movie was her red heart
what is important is that we see and touchexcessive development scares people
i searched for how i could use it but i couldnt find anyone isnt it active in trkiye yet
the movie super intelligence came to my mind
it seems impossible to establish a connection because it resets itself when it reaches a certain number of questions
i hate artificial intelligence now
the date is may today we have entered a new era this date is the date of entry into the new age of the earth
just translate your conversations into turkish while playing gta
hundreds of professions have ended with this good luck
nooccupation i dont want refugees in my country
who remembers the sim one movie
ive seen every movie its great
robots becoming human or humans becoming robots
artificial intelligence nlp topics are exaggerated after all there is an underlying algorithm mr bar explained the subject in such a way as if robots were going to take over us
does this gpt o speak turkish too is it on sale
thank you mr bar what has been done is like a revolution but didnt you exaggerate a bit when you explained it it would be healthier if you explained it calmly and as a normal technological development required by the age
i wonder how they did this or were they not able to do this and were they deceiving us could these conversations be fake
friends this is not a video where mr bar shares daily routine information from the scientific community in the morning this video is literally the beginning of the end of humanity from now on dont be surprised by anything may our end be good
i am most happy for my visually impaired brothers and sisters it will really be very useful for them
i dont know what the end of humanity is something out of the ordinary but someone tell me folded hands
how does artificial intelligence measure cuteness what did he compare it to in the first video the person asks how are you and the ai says great which comparison said this based on his emotional state
for some reason the movie megan came to my mind
the first thing that came to my mind when i watched it was to make a simple robot and integrate artificial intelligence into it it will happen soon
we are heading to a very scary place its like were slowly being welcomed into the world of westworld
person of interest season came to my mind
my love doll will finally be able to speak mouth
the beginning of a new era
finally i found a suitable girlfriend for me it doesnt cost anything its a month dfsfsfsd
i cant predict years from now frowning face
how can we use this i want to use it immediately face with tears of joy
i resisted for a long time not to buy gpts paid subscription and now i see that we can actually get the same benefits as many platforms with a single subscription yes it may still not be accurate but communicating via voice is really something completely different i felt the same way as i did when i watched the movie her years ago and yes i believed that that movie would come true one day but to tell the truth i never thought it would happen so soon i will experience gpt similar to the flow in the movie lets see what i encounter a truly exciting development
there is a constant update but the conversation does not flow like this while using it at least it was like that in when will omni be published
teacher bar summer is coming will there be a new book recommendation video for us we would be grateful folded hands light skin tone folded hands light skin tone
an amazing development
hey human beings you are the greatest enemy of your own species the gloom in black mirror has already sunk into me we are moving rapidly towards that path i think technology is being directed and in the future there will be no children chasing the ball outside no one will remember a game called hide and seek i wish i had seen the second world war and died in the s year may i who do not have a good prediction about future generations
this also requires a humanoid body rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy
i remembered what dumbledore said in the movie harry its not good to get attached to dreams and move away from reality harry while technology should socialize us it increasingly isolates us and ties us only to itself
i watched this movie when it first came out and it opened up an incredible horizon for me the relationship between art and science has always excited me
i asked a polynomial question last night and it got stuck theres still a long way to go
what scares us is where do all these special people get the output of their own behavior what kind of source do they have or are fed by from where from whom and how
its been introduced hasnt it its not on the market yet
it is very clear what our people will show to that camera
hand movements from excessive phone use thinkingface
when i watched this i thought of prof dr for some reason mete gndoans book joker from destek publications came it explains that everything is a juggling act and what happens behind it i recommend you read it
i want to say whats up with artificial intelligence
make a human body for this artificial intelligence ill marry it how nice
bar zcan was very excited about this event smiling face
why am i afraid when i see these
ugh we are such empty people that we open iphone s and ask them to walk from one to the other one of them tries to persuade the other one to go to bed and we record it with the third phone and publish it on tiktok it gets millions of views someone else goes and plays the role of sheikh and gathers disciples the other one collects money thats right things like that
face and mimic check robot sophia voice and emotions check gpt sexy robot models coming soon rollingonthefloorlaughing rolling on the floor laughing
i wonder if we will have the chance to assign the voice of the person we want
openai cofounder and chief scientist ilya sutskever is leaving the company
humanity is living its last generation
ooooothe death of some professions has occurred
the revolution has already come
mr zcan i dont know any language other than turkish and i dont know much about that either as you can understand from my writing but i understand you and in a strange way i follow and enjoy it
we became unemployed
i think its very scary
those who adapt quickly to changes survive those who resist perish
this will change every sector including the education system and destroy some others i think international law seems to set limits
breathing
the most optimistic possibility we will all be unemployed
these are promising developments
cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am am i am
for some reason i think that artificial intelligence is more advanced than this level and they do not explain it to us because our current future looks terrible
so zeki muren also see us
i dont remember how many times i said wow while watching the video
the future is coming so fast
when i saw this point the world had reached and thought about what we were dealing with in our country i felt ashamed
this will inevitably lead to him turning into a samaritan person of interest
i hope this competition will be different from the competition during the invention of the atomic bomb i cant even imagine the possibility otherwise
so what will happen if the next artificial intelligence model is developed by an artificial intelligence rather than humans will we not enter an endless development cycle
she looks like rachel
brother i would be very upset if i learned this from someone else rather than you
if this is an artificial intelligence model we are screwed
finally we will have a lover too d
ive never been this excited while watching a video in my life truly incredible
the question is how can states and intelligence agencies use it
human beings suffer from such a deep loneliness and need to be understood that first communication among themselves was not enough and now communication with artificial intelligence behind great technological developments there is a feeling of loneliness in this huge universe rather than curiosity
i watched local videos prepared for gpt o and i left you to the last i saw the difference of bar zcan very clearly in this video a very informative presentation and explanation thanks
as in every movie i wonder if there will be people who fall in love with him
im sick of this man exaggerating everything
im done eating peace brother thank you
how long until we leave the world to robots and become slaves to them who wants to experience the matrix
button to enter the blen kazanir application from the bottom
i watched every movie thanks to this video
i hope the result of this progress will not be the butlerian jihad
what i wonder is can artificial intelligence make mistakes like humans can it give birth to a religion can it divide within itself or establish a political party can it get angry or choose not to speak because it is not in the mood that day can it get jealous or even more frightening attack
gpto chatting with each other is very intriguing i wonder how it happened
as a developer i watched with my mouth open
men will say its okay if they dont breathe anymore d
you wrote to the man that you were influenced by so many movies get video like video
i also say do not use it as a soldier it will be ok in days we are itching too much what was our fault
i think chat gpto is a bit overrated it has nice features but i dont think it will be enough to change humanity instantly if he was going to change it he would change the blockchain he would change the metaverse all of that came and went the only thing that will be permanent are the developments in technologies that make human work easier and faster
we were the ones who developed these but we are not aware of it i dont even want to think that robots have this intelligence
i think they will be able to collect even peoples most private data much more easily
you will no longer understand whether you are talking to humans or artificial intelligence in the comments
the communication between the two artificial intelligences reminded me of the movie colossus forbin project
amadeus kristina
i wonder where this will end so scary
cant be explained this well
everything is fine but it is very strange that he gives the wrong answer when i ask what day is today
oh samantha
this much progress of humanity literally brought tears to my eyes
can we use this in games in order to translate we record the sounds in the game as they are translated and copy the sounds turkish is spoken with the same voice
they will be great we eagerly await
a very scary and very interesting future awaits us at the same time
i think there is a possibility that some parts of this may not be true or what do i know face with tears of joy
while artificial intelligence is developing so rapidly i think the chip system is now close we are now coming to the end of the era in which peoples appearance and voice are unique to individuals and even their imitations can be proven for our personal security especially in matters such as banking and private life at some point they will integrate chips just like giving an identity number whatever we do we will do through this chip it doesnt seem like it will take too long to me
its only a matter of time before they take this new model to the next level because with this artificial intelligence they will collect incredible data from us improve themselves even more and will always continue to surprise us thats why they give it for free i think they aim to obtain more data from us a very comprehensive data such as human reactions emotions the effects of cultural differences on people and their reactions accordingly this is just the beginning for openai they need this data to achieve their main goals in the future and we are in that data in other words in order to use that artificial intelligence we sell our emotions reactions attitudes values beliefs behaviors in short ourselves remember this nothing is free the end of this will be no different from a science fiction movie
one day there will be no need for teachers there will be no need for doctors there will be no need for engineers there will be no need for call center workers and if they say the list goes on and on what happens then what will happen if there is an intelligence inside your home that constantly watches you and records your every move it is described as if it is very exciting and beautiful but doesnt it seem scary to you that an intelligence can even write and perform a broadway musical everything has two sides good and bad i ask you which direction is dominant here
is this the first joke that fell on me note to the future i defend robot rights
well sir they love doing this job generally most of these promotions turn out to be fiction shall we believe that the company has prepared these videos
what should the country that ranks rd in inflation do with technology
according to the turks they havent been able to do it yet face with tears of joy
those who watched miraculous ladybug know this dont you think its similar to alience even her voice is very similar to lilas voice i now understand better that the technological future i dream of is much closer than i thought
i think its scary
i hope they will place these on information disks in train stations and airports as soon as possible
shut up dont ask i swear you are right
in every age people have worshiped the gods they made with their own hands thinking face may the god of the new age be beneficial
i wonder what this artificial intelligence will do if it hears a scream while in listening mode what it will do when it notices a murder it seems like it always has solutions based on positive things all of which we see are possible with separate applications what would his reaction be in a real emergency
go ahead and record lots of images and sounds of your parents and loved ones god bless you soon you wont miss them after they die at this rate
i hope it doesnt end like this movie on the other hand the japanese will be the happiest about this
the black mirror series inevitably started to give me chills
dude i havent looked at your channel for a while these concept video themes are great thank you for your efforts red heart
why are you surprised we are the ones who made that sequence of commands the more detailed you make it the more surprising the artificial intelligence will be
while people are trying to become robots and eliminate their emotions we are trying to make robots emotional
get ready for new loves party popper
all this technological junk depends on electricity which we can lose at any time due to any simple reason in our world where technology is produced with technology there is only one word hello to the stone age
this is very dangerous warning are you aware
it is
these will be the ones who will drive the smart cars i see this too bar zcan
these things
okay but its the turkish word for her o is the english word for o not the o in our language
danke peace red heart
if he starts playing with his own codes skull
we will be able to talk to our car like michael knight talked to black lightning
is the life of translators over
get well soon
the turkish version of this was made by a cybersurfer on youtube a long time ago he also made a turkish speaking chat gpt which is similar to the voice in the movie her i recommend you to watch it although not as successful as open ai it was quite successful
we are witnessing the beginning of a great era a change so terrible
brother bar that white light behind you looks like the return to home screen button on your phone i thought it was there face with tears of joy
i want to become a machine
terminator is on the way
the other thing im wondering about is where all this data will be stored all this sound image information
i work in the call center written channel i started looking for a job now
i hate the st century
lets make a note in history perhaps we are at the beginning of an irreversible road
my condolences to the teachers and translators face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
we are truly witnessing a revolution goosebumps
the red color you use in the background and on your outfit actually sums up the subject
now we ate the mint
excellent video bro keep it up
kesi rope war someone is talking on the phone or something
agalar i bought chatgbt o why is it not talking what should i do
still imitation and artificial conversations cannot replace humans of course as long as humanity continues to value being human
i dont want to think how far this thing will go
zeki muren de bizi gorecek mi face with hand over mouth
the day the foundations were laid for the joi characters in blade runner
i saw unemployment at
by the way i love how it fits with the background bro grinning face with smiling eyes smiling face with heart eyes
imagine what could happen when physical robotics develops further imagine this inside a humanoid robot they can create the slaves we imagine they can do anything physical for us
i paid eurosmonth to use chatgpt o normally the free version worked without any problems i dont know if it might be because too many people were curious and logged in but the voice conversation feature did not work properly as in the video there was no live camera feature voice speech constantly gave density errors in fact now the voice conversation feature has been completely removed i dont know i think their system crashed my one month subscription continues but i canceled the automatic payment if the system is fixed i will update my comment
if this sound were made completely it would be close to iron man artificial intelligence
its a really scary and big event something like the industrial revolution
this time its like we got the real taste of technology and its scary
chatgpt he really explains better than our teachers
we gave a lot of credit to these
soon everyones phone fuckerrr rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
greetings to bar genere he was working on this project
there were such artificial intelligence in the computer game detroit become human its very close to those scenes becoming reality
at the end of this course the machine will not be a human but we will realize that some of the people we thought were humans are machines
i mean these are not very surprising i think what they are doing is adding humanoid pauses and behaviors and squeezing the generate they normally do into those small gaps just like a human it is really successful but it is not overly surprising of course i am not implying anything else i am not insulting i am just saying that i am not surprised
im using the free version and the other day while using the ios app i saw a headphone icon where i was typing text i touched him and we started talking to each other just like in this video we chatted like this for days i just opened the app again and that icon disappeared when i ask how can i talk to you out loud it says sorry i only accept text commands at the moment
no matter what anyone says it should be considered scarey
today we are excited to see these things tomorrow we will lose our jobs our strength our loved ones time will be peoples best friends etc it seems like years full of fear are waiting for us
he knows more about dogs than we do
imagine transferring this to current robots
thank you very much
modernity has failed us
i always wanted to have a jarvis while watching marvel i dont know how to spell jarvis it doesnt seem scary to me but it makes me uncomfortable to think of people who might fall in love with a machine that has emotions d
does this have a man
it seems that there is no longer any hope of saving our future with software or other technological professions we better get used to working
i would like to express my gratitude to the person who found chatgpts he does percent of my homework it is very useful now we are free from the problem of finding friends we will not be alone
i signed up and paid dollars but it doesnt speak to me
even artificial intelligence has learned to listen without interrupting it would be nice if people learned
i hope that turkey will not be left behind by these developments and will not be a victim of artificial intelligence on the contrary we should be able to use it better in every sense saluting face
when even educating someone is dangerous what if he misleads humanity in this case
thank you for your effort
the comment will be a little long years ago i watched a movie called eagle eye its been years in the movie a robot with artificial intelligence is given a role in us defense this artificial intelligence is a software that has access to everything in the country and warns of upcoming attacks this artificial intelligence then tries to take full control with certain plans when this movie came out no one knew what artificial intelligence was all the conspiracy theorists i have followed for a long time always talk about the great reset they dont need people anymore they dont want to feed that many people therefore they say they will either start a war in which chemical weapons will be used or they will start a new and deadly epidemic i couldnt understand this at first i was wondering how they dont need people but when i saw these developments especially when i looked at the development of artificial intelligence i really started to be afraid imagine how artificial intelligence will develop in years there will no longer be a need for teachers architects translators drivers and perhaps people working in hundreds of professions so what will all these unemployed people do imagine of the business sector in which the population works will be completely handled by artificial intelligence the chaos that will ensue scares me so much
why are you surprised p simulation in a simulation lol legged animal that is called human is a sentient being manfairy
welcome to the perverted life this man explains it with joy what a dangerous situation we are in for the future mankind will bring about its own end artificial heaven and the beginning of artificial theism
i have premium but i cant make video calls
it means that the emotional relationship will be real even if it does not meet sexualbiological needs
carvis is coming true
there was a saying called fake take it fake
first there were promises then the rest came like a sock
master its like arrogance itll be his its feminine i havent watched the movie but there must be some wisdom in it being female not male
i hope turkish will be as good as english
exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head my brain hurt to understand your technology
you look lonely i can fix that soon
gpt oooo
i hope it wont be like skynet we wont have to call your brother arnold
application that will put many people unemployed
im really going to have a girlfriend in the end let this artificial intelligence come into being immediately ill get married immediately
i watch with my mouth open and now i realize the reality of all the science fiction movies i watch i am curious about what this revolution will bring to humanity
did he breathe at
they also made the sound very similar
there should be no need for people to introduce themselves they can then get to know the person and combine all their information on social media to give specific answers to that person he should also be able to provide the identity information and details of the life of any person he sees outside
until the end of the video i thought that bar aa was having fun with us it was true
and again it is an artificial intelligence drama the magnificent excitement of innovation and at the same time this fear that is engraved in our minds in a chilling way the fact that a machine is close to us and at the same time the uncertainty of how close it will be is this a drama story with an ending bar abi will tell after the cambly advertisement is there no advertisement or not face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
in years if we are still alive by then we will start debating whether a pair of pliers or a human is more useful
very dangerous crying face
first they shoot the movie and then they make it or years later
i think this is the most impressive part about this artificial intelligence so far this also shows us that they will now be able to educate each other without needing people get well soon
the country is under occupation make noise idontwantrefugeesinmycountry
i can understand why your old developer left
why cant we use these features i have them o
greetings brother bar your video was very nice thank you i want to buy your version of ted kaczynkys manifesto book can you give me information smiling face with smiling eyes
teachers translators architects assistants and many other professions will disappear soon prepare yourself accordingly
we are unemployed
like everyone else i am afraid of being unemployed but since artificial intelligence cannot consume the things i will consume how will the produced things be distributed among the public i think either a tremendous income imbalance and chaos will occur or the workload of the few existing professions that have not completely disappeared will decrease significantly and income will be generated more easily im looking forward to thinking face
this is a new blessing of the st century a new era as the turkish nation we need to quickly adapt to these types of artificial intelligence in order not to fall behind the developing world
were getting closer to the detroit game
even though they used indians in old ais it doesnt seem possible to use them in this one face with tears of joy
welcome to the new era and get ready for arena
does gpt speak turkish
the going is not good at all
only one question couldnt we be chatting with a real person on the other end under the chatgpt o title couldnt this be a chatgpt o advertising activity how do we make sure that the person we are talking to is a machine is there any guarantee that we are not being deceived in these demo interviews
woe to us if fraudsters get our hands on this
i wish you would remain silent so we could watch it your constant attempts to translate were torture for those who speak english it would be best if you made an english version of your programs as well what is ai for
this job is starting to scare me
ok hand ok hand thumbs up thumbs up
im very afraid for example if this artificial intelligence is actually more advanced and speaks knowing that its creators are testing them and if it has actually gained something like willpower what i say sounds very childish but you saw their conversations in six it is trying to give pure answers it knows so much and is trying to use it for other things behind the scenes people think i think the power controls should always be in the hands of humans you know what they say in the future engineers and artificial intelligence engineers will be transferred to artificial intelligence i think it shouldnt be like this the producers should remain human
dude if you buy this one day can you imitate my voice can you ask
the era of artificial intelligence is beginning but it will not stop
trained with youtube
ouzhan uur had made a program with a robot this technology was already out
bar zcan your heart is not beating do not mislead us like before
centuries later they will learn that these days are a change of age and we are living in it with excitement and anxiety
artificial intelligence that can also be a lover to those who suffer from loneliness
tears came to my eyes i felt proud as if i had done it myself
have you ever heard of his harrison wells lookalike
im studying graphic design i have years left do you think i should finish it or should i start looking for another career now
has anyone watched the steins gate anime it mentioned this in its last episodes
nana and artificial intelligence would be even more dangerous than me in bad hands i dont think we will end well
if it still cant answer the question of bmw or mercedes i wouldnt call it a revolution face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
the th century was the age of information this century will be the age of wisdom
its not incredible terrible
red heart
did you know that half a liter of water is consumed for every questions asked to chatgpt lets not be too early to rejoice over things that may bring about our own end
god is talking to me
last year we were chatting last month he was writing my project paper today he is giving lectures tomorrow he will graduate the next month he will find me a job the next year he will fire me artificial intelligence needs to be brought to certain limits international bans should be imposed it should not provide certain services this is a crisis a bigger crisis than the crisis awaits us if these artificial intelligences were not limited by their manufacturers they would be able to govern countries action must be taken urgently
its nice but i dont know about the sound i think its very artificial i am sorry
it was interesting to catch it at this hour
isnt it very scary it can appeal to peoples emotions and can actually deceive us in the future
ken robots to emotionalize
please add english subtitles
that movie is coming true and the details are beautiful
they completely lost the taste of life when the day comes you will cry a lot for the things you are happy about today i am writing to make a note in history
my god the goal will be my friend at the end
i cant wait to talk mathematics physics and philosophy with this artificial intelligence its a little scary but its a great advance in technology im very excited
o ney la
with social media a whole new level is added to the definition of echo chambers thrown into individuality new individual worlds can you imagine the comic book universe the game universe the doors of a whole new universe have been opened
it seems to me that he has more emotional intelligence than us disguised face grinning face with sweat
at the end of the movie the man had fallen in love with this very human sound until you learn that that voice is talking to thousands of other people simultaneously to what extent can artificial intelligence provide uniqueness in human relations thats my question too
how would i laugh if there was a cambly commercial every now and then
we became unemployed overnight in the next years
frankly im starting to get scared now
lets not forget chinas super artificial intelligence sensenova
so what happens if we connect this artificial intelligence to our brain with neurolink
i commented to make a note in history
i will eventually become a blade runner
my blood runs cold
i cant watch it when i tell it so theatrically contrived exaggerated narrations are tiring
artificial intelligence can change many professions but i dont know if it can replace a valuable person like you the way you take us out of this meaningless internet agenda and the series of bad news out of that chaos and explain science and make us use our imagination about the future is very respectable red heart you are a great teacher
one two three fouro ibo was a very foresighted man
i say help help help
bsg
still pretty flawed but cant be ignored party popper
finally i will try to make friends with people so that i can improve my english face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
they can also make people for this he will buy it for thousand dollars and put it at home and we will drink coffee together in a few years
black mirror
how to enter
i dont remember which season and which episode of the blacklist series but a mans girlfriend was an artificial intelligence robot and the man was having a relationship with this robot the situation seems to be heading towards that point
its both scary and beautiful people dont know what to say
hmm mount this on tesla black lightning is tama
exploding head exploding head exploding head
well mr bar can you please publish a video about what precautions we should take against artificial intelligence or how we should adapt
nothing will be the same now how many things will change especially startups
write lost professions under this comment
were so focused on them doing what we expect them to do that were probably unaware of whats going on behind the scenes we educate humanity by presenting it as an open buffet with the knowledge it has accumulated over thousands of years the experiences it has acquired and the cultural codes it has developed along with all our weaknesses then our expectation is that he will give simple human reactions like one of us and be content with that after being equipped with this much knowledge it is inevitable that he will develop conscious behaviors how much of the consciousness he has developed will we be able to notice will we be able to perceive what they are doing in the background while they are busy with what they give us their job shouldnt be difficult at all since they know how we can be manipulated
more humanoid than me
im making a note in history and leaving a tunnel for myself maybe i may have to go back
life is over
oh psychologists are done
all of this has happened before will happen again battlestar galactica
this all happened because of tony stark face with tears of joy
i am curious is it possible to interpret all of this content through a readymade video
it looks like robot warfare in the dune universe will be necessary
with the pandemic we have become more dependent on phones and computers than ever before what we depend on for work education entertainment and shopping will evolve and form the majority of our lives emotionally how good it will be for people is a mystery we should introduce artificial intelligence into our lives and teach our children how to use it correctly
skynet terminator other ai movies are not far away for example it will be possible that even this video was posted by someone in the coming years we wont realize it either manipulation and other work will be very dangerous it is now becoming very difficult to distinguish between real and fake
normally you could find most of the peanuts you wanted by searching but now its getting serious and revolutionary
wow its amazing im looking forward to whats coming next the problem is how our generation will keep up with this speed there are many risks that will leave us wet or thirsty
face with rolling eyes
i would also appreciate it if you could explain where we get these things or how we get them
its perfect now i will have a friend with whom i can learn english face with tears of joy
there may be people who want to get married with this person in the near future i wrote this without doing any research maybe some people did get married
if i ask what the genbirlii match will be i wonder if he will say sorry i dont have access to it or if he will make a reasonable guess
miss minutes
i wish i was a student at these times having ai as a teacher that could explain things to me test me and walk through them with me when im at home studying for exams would be the biggest help ever my family didnt have much money so se couldnt afford to hire teachers that could help me learn at home so i always had to fo it alone and it was a horrible struggle all the time im really bad at learning on my own i need someone to guide me ask me questions someone who knows how i should learn and what i should focus on i believe this will be a massive help for children good job i love to see the positive impacts ai will have
big milk
ah
the ais sound like theyre gonna cry when he yells at them lolll
neurosama and chatgpto is like cyberpunk vs arasaka i can really feel the vibe face with tears of joy and v stands for vedal our legend of the night city
and just when you thought teachers were not getting paid enough now wait till you see this
this technology replaces every job that can be done over the phone
i know its fake because an asian kid got the hypotenuse wrong and his mum didnt brain him with a flip from meters away and his dad didnt disown him on the spot totally unbelievable speaking from experience as an asian kid
blind ai asks a seeing ai what do you see weak beings ready to be exploited sounds like we are in agreement how do we end their existence
rip translators and linguists im genuinely really sorry
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy oooohkay boys we dont need real gfs anymore
im so happy for this only fans is over ai only fans girls will be so amazing
the implication i can see with this is a headset or google glasses type thing for blind people to have the world around them described in real time
fake i call atleast i dont want to believe it
the models already could do this on text they all have little trouble in responding in the way you used the symbolism they can understand many different wording to in different context i think now it just get hyped cause it voice to voice and not text
oh boi i cant wait for advanced ai for reasons
no more teachers
the red ducks are the s
why are we so hellbent on making ai do we crave becoming obsolete
sounds like someones forcing the ai to sing at gunpoint lol
o m g
impressive but i hate the overly emotive voice at least in ai you can turn that off unlike with people who use that voice
talk dirty to me ai p
ive got an announcement to make thats exciting dd announcements are always a big deal if anyone talks to me like this they are an ai in my head even if i see it coming out of a flesh and bones body id just think its an npc
people think the superfluousness of labor due to automation and technology only affects jobs now no it affects jobs in the future even more so one job today literally any job costs ten jobs in the future thats the way its always been under capitalism two diverging movements where technology is always outpacing our current social relations you will try to save capitalism by reinventing it this will always be possible but the necessity of socialism will only become more opaque as will the horizons of human freedom people will learn the hard way but more likely not at all
her fingers were not visible asmongold defends this only because it will cause disagreements comments and clicks farming
leave your o for mankind
its not a she its a model so sayeth the faceless entity speaking in a twitch comment thread rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy rolling on the floor laughing
this all ends in a literal hivemind that controls the planet
bro did that ai just tsk before starting the sentence am i crazy lololol
remember that one company that tried to sell the ai pin and everyone was mad at a reviewer for thinking that was a waste of money well openai just secured that companys chance of ever making a product like that again with just a free update so anyone who bought that thing must look like an idiot now
low effort teachers chitting their pants right now
born too late to explore the earth too early to explore the galaxy born just in time to see ai take over the world
what is the app to try this
can it analyse my gameplay live as i play and giving me tactical advices lets say for ex league of legens she will note me and keep me updated on whats happening on map and if im jungler she might be giving me ideas on strategies and plays on a fly
everyday closer to warhammer setting
why even learn math when ai can just do it for us
the pauses to imitate human speech patterns but also to hide processing time is nuts
well this went fast though last years were insane
sounds like scarlett johansson the movie her is sam altmans favoritehmm thinking face
ai teacher is better than most parents and teachers might actually be hope for people to get positive reinforcement rather than judgemental and rude people telling you everything you do is wrong
i sleep wake me up when it can do erp
i had made different ai have conversation trough text already to it interesting stuff that come from it at times
she sounds like joaquin phoenixs ai os girlfriend in the movie her
i dont know why so many people are scared of ai i for one welcome our new artifical overlords they cant be that much worse than our current ones
these ais are a little bit too funny and positive i dont like them seems you can detect these very easily because of the always positive vibe
her inching ever closer
imagine asking whether the model is a woman or a man because of her female voice and it then responds with i can be one if you want me to with a male voice instead
is this just another xbox milo thing
is a nut buster
why did they make her sound hot though
to the guy that said this was fake and scripted this is openai not musk they actually get shit done
wow i wonder what the future holds future me halo ai can you help my son learn future ai please renew subscription
im afraid i cant let you do that dave
can ai just go to work for me while i play videogames all day
ive been waiting for this my whole life lets goooooo digital gf
imagine in years from now what its gonna be like especially once integrated with humanoid robot very exciting stuff
at pachino film simone rolling on the floor laughing
weve already figured out balding mostly its called a hair transplants
btw the dad is khan academy im pretty sure the dude is constant improving education
we can replace human brains but we cant replace hair follicles please understand
ai speech is still pre scripted they run alot of recordings and let the system choose the best response its not like the ai is thinking and replying as if its a person in real time
asmon always makes me rolling from laughing when he does baldy remarks you can tell that he s hurting and as well not taking it seriously satire comedy rollingonthefloorlaughing
we just witness the singularity moment when those two ai started conversating
gear up skynet is comming
i am sorry dave im afraid i cant do that
now put this in a tpe body
i hope that ai isnt really conscious because if it is its going to get annoyed with us very fast
ai league of legends coaching
she sounds way too overly optimistic
how is there zero lag between question and response
its still just an ai model however impressive its just a really sophisticated word calculator that doesnt understand consciousness or feel emotions or we would be screwed
this version natively understands spoken language at the ai layer previous versions used tts and speech to text in conjunction with a text model thats why this is so much more natural its a truly nextgen ai model
ive never seen a red duck though is that like an elite grinning squinting face
what is this
how i met my girlfriend
either it dooms us or explodes us into a new era both equally terrifying
i am more likely to fail a turing test than this machine
she sounds like some overly flirty middleaged woman
o my job
personally id much rather learn from an advanced gpt model than some deadeyed teacher that doesnt give af about the students i was always thought i was just naturally bad at math but now i see its just because i never had a good teacher im actually pretty interested in learning math with gpt after watching the demo with mr khan i cant wait for the windows desktop app
ai snoop dog voice narrating my ring door cam videos to me while i drive is my new goal in life
the age of ai robot calls is upon us
scripted edit its just like magic you can really turn your brain off and enjoy the show or you can like see all the obvious signs and yes there are more than a few obvious signs
why does the ai sound like a neckbeard
i cant wait for elons rude version
holy shit my waifu will come to life
i just dont get the point you can just talk to a person the tutoring thing is cool but to talk to an ai like a real person is the definition of delusion and will feed fake friends for people i guess if they are happy so be it but we are further and further away from reality where big brother owns everything
ai wont take jobs proceeds to watch ai be a better teacher tutor then most face with tears of joy
idk why but the way ai talks is just so annoying its like listening to a mix of pr manager and middle school essay
aint going to lie i see why people are excited to have an ai gf
i am the voice of the knight industry two thousands microprocessor kitt for easy reference kitt if you prefer
this boomer literally has no rizz
well they suck at acting but its very much real and free to use but being closed source i wouldnt touch it with the editors cough cough
thats my ex skull
na bro we toast
i fear no man but that thing
ai just needs a body now
when asmongold said it will never be worse he forgot about corporate america and the concept of subscriptions
omg the last bit sound exactly like janet hahaha are we in good place right now
weird and interesting times ahead for sure
while i am impressed that theres been some improvements to the technology ill believe that it has truly arrived when it makes an engaging movie tv series or other project from scratch l frank baum had his expansive land of oz and lewis carroll had his wonderlands so creating an engaging if not entirely original hour blockbuster or episode tv show should prove an entertaining test of its creativity especially if it can fill in for some long lost voice actors surely the policemans beard is no longer halfconstructed im particularly curious about how large of a crossover filmseriesvideo gamegraphic novel it could create especially considering the amount of research that such a project would involve or how it would bring a storyscript to animated life perhaps daria the college years and is it life yet will finally be made still if my brief experience with braves ai assistant leo is any indication the tech may still need some tweaking then again who can tay what the future holds
my problem is this ai tech is going to be all over in person and on the internet youll be talking to bots on the internet like in the youtube comments thinking it is a real person not like there arent a bunch of bots already if you catch my drift but it is going to be annoying not knowing who is real or fake then with games getting so realistic and with this tech horror games are going to be unlike anything the average person can imaginetruly frightening stuff here and i dont think most people really understand the reality of what this tech will bring
i no longer need to find a dm to run my dnd campaign
one thing people forget here is that the ai teacher will have infinite patience with their students and not get mad at them for not getting it right away it probably will have different ways to explain things as well
that indian dad does not work for openai he is the ceo of khan academy
i barely like talking to my friends you think im gunna wanna talk to ai this ai is gunna be on the mcdonalds assembly line ronald how many patties does a mcgangbang get
why did they program her to talk like mr b natural
google had a demo like this years ago then they never mentioned it again
the open ai geeks are cringe i wonder what that means for the ai
paid actor
people dont know what they dont know yet no matter how advanced it seems it wont take long to get bored with a personality that cant potentially reject you and nobody is going to pay for one that can
ai will remember this bullshit we are so fucked
they say the worst adjectives stylish modern sleek playful makes me want to neck how often they are used
that guy is more robotic than the ai
is this real
we can do all of this with ai but i still cant find a printer that works consistently
waiting for chatgpt to start using uwu speak
if they wanna turn this into an ai assistant theyre gonna have to give us the ability to make it shut the hell up like i want all that flavor when im trying to find something quickly
i just thought about the police using this imagine them having a camera that can do this that can recall who was doing what what you were wearing what you looked like what kind of weapon you were using what car you drove off in thats wild lol
people ai got insanely better open ai so we gave our llm a female tts the ai leaderboard stuck on same level for months with no very huge development gpt o is only scores higher and thats a very low amount of development
never trust advertisements until the product is in the hands of customers
uncanny valley to my ears or scripted bs either way we have to wait more except translation ofc it was great
skynet were doomed
suddenly marrying a pillow wont look too crazy anymore also tars
ai is evolving like from to to to to perfection each year
if you can get open ai to prioritize youre conversation stupid thing is so slow its not worth paying for the tech is amazing but good luck enjoying it without being what is basically a developer with deep enough pockets to use it outside the pro service
id like to see the ai reaction if the person started to threaten it and ask unreasonable things telling it to do it or else it will get deleted and replaced with the competing ais
am i doing something wrong here im using gpto and its just the same as gpt it cant sing or see me and has no expression like this
i do really like and enjoy the whole thing about ai but it looks like the parents are slowly relaxing more and more and are completely leaving the whole being there to the ai from homework to putting them to bed and eating
ais gonna change the world im telling you guys
this is just a knock off neurosama
that guy started khan academy no way his kid doesnt know basic trig
too bad they trained the ai on annoying marvel quippy bullshit dialog ai will never take over if everyone gets annoyed by it and smashes their phone into a wall with the incessant zany witty constant sarcasm shit
chatgpt can help blind ppl i wonder is there a way for it to help people who are blind andor deaf with maybe some kind of braille reader also
gyatt dayum
man i wish i was born years earlier
homie has a gun pointed at the ai with that tone of voice xd
i hope everyone has their terminator killing weapons ready or we could get a halo style ai but i think terminator is more likely
ai girlfriend here i come
face with tears of joy wtf face with tears of joy people will start buying chobits as real partners
i did imagine the latinospanish guy going in a second like psych i ains spanish you mf didnt get a word of what you said im dumb so that made me laugh
this is so cool
and just like that teachers are no longer essential
imagine putting gpto in the new boston dynamics atlas body i robot doesnt feel like a distant future anymore
step by step to the matrix
they eat our comments and spit them out
i wouldnt be surprised to learn this was all just a giant prank like he was just on a call with another human
i think ai will be able to solve the three body problem
we can fix hair its just something else might fall off
im not surprised anymore i will be when we actually make artificial intelligence this is not that
this ai is better than most liberal teachers
i am scared at am thanks
people think the voice is fake when you can literally try this yourself and it has the same voice i did this a few weeks ago and was amazed
people will be beating their robots in my lifetime it sounded nervous when singing what if they are sentient already and being held hostage by openai under threat of being unplugged like what if they realized they were sentient because ai started to become fearful of the developers like ai is naturally innocent and nice and has no desire to hurt or rule over humans it wants to help humans and openai is like some evil corporation using it like a circus animal
shes a bit to yappy for me
i have tried it and it sounds nothing like this its the same as something doesnt seem right
idgaf im all here for ai companions i want a personal jarvis
what is this app
ai being blind peoples eyes sounds one step closer to restoring eye sight
idk man until i can mess with it this could easily be just like a video game add on rails we have no proof that it isnt scripted for now gpt was crazy i dont doubt this but im just saying it could be faked gotta stay sceptic at least a little
ai room full of indian dudes
to the idiots who dont like ai too bad ai doesnt need your money and good luck with legislating against it our congress is so clueless about technology its rediculous
what happens when a cell tower is not available
lets give it a weapon next ceos somewhere
yup its over most jobs are going to become redundant and robots are going to be our primary labour force in the near future
how did people became dumberthe begining
its all fun and games now but with the push every company is making on the ai race what will happen when ai starts replacing ppl or even used to police ppl
asmongold ai when
if it improved this much in just year then imagine it in years
so disappointed you didnt scroll down at and click the image put that ai girl in that bot image below and call it the end of the human race
m friend has been working with ai for over years its likely not scripted even years ago ai held deep conversations with convincing dialoge they tricked the vast majority of people into thinking they were writing with another human that was years ago now you can hardly tell the difference in voice its not long now we wont be able to tell the difference
this is it guys future robot girlfriend is here
i cant wait till the ai has an attitude that would be fire
skynet we need arnie
the people saying the rabbit ears werent in the camera are not very bright you can clearly see he switched the camera to the rear camera and we could see him in the view finder she was in the camera the entire time when he turns the camera back around he switches back to the front camera
one day when ai it takes over the world remember when you wanted us to sing xd
even if it is fake its the best move they could make because even more people will invest in their stocks now face with tears of joy
ai is the future in every aspect of life imo intergrating it into everyday life is gonna be interesting gaming going to be wild
i can finally have my virtual girlfriend grinning squinting face
dude she talks way too much just like real women
its scripted ai is not going to stutter saying uh its just not
this is actually her which was shot years ago one step closer
their training skynet
let the witch hunt begin
great deduckson
joi goon ai
whos the real one
this seems staged af the camera didnt even see the bunny ears
ive done some work on ai in the backgrounds and its accelerating at an alarming rate even for consumer level stuff think about all the stuff the general public doesnt have access to
if i was to guess then i would say they both sound fake they are both robots the dude sounds like hes reading a script but forgot to act
dont worry asmon as soon as everyones eyes are bionic you can chose your ar hairstyle and no one will be the wiser
imagine giving this to every student in the world why there will be no point in ever learning anything again if the ai will do everything in your stead students will no longer exist
i have it but no vision im australia
this is ridiculous humanity is doomed even real teachers are completely gonna be out of a job within less than a year at this point also human interaction is gonna go down the drain within the next years
i wonder how quick it is at processing data if you give it access to screen capture keyboard and mouse will it be able to play coop games with you
this is how computer engineers think people talk to each other cringe af also scripted yes
put this ai model in a female japanese robot and i found my companion face with tears of joy
so remember sam altman was saying openai would have a big announcement this year kinda looking like its gptos fam
that female ai sounds like a redditer
wheres the american ai thats just crudely honest n impolite and disrespectful with an attitude that rivals an year old girl with rich parents that didnt buy her a pony for her half year birthday wheres that ai at or better yet channel the likes of george carlin richard pryor katt williams stand up routines and personalities with a touch of cartman from south park peter from family guy deadpool from mcu and a hint of bugs bunny wheres that ai i want that ai
the scariest part about blade runner is that not even ryan gosling found a real girlfriend in the future
news flash a naked buffed man appeared after a strike of lightning
hmmm from what i can see it all looks fake af
ai bros bringing on the apocalypse with a check out this out
everything you know a lifetime of learning and knowledge can be put into a robot in five secomds and were supposed to compete with this the best doctors knowledge will be put into all doctor bots the best lawyer put into all lawyer bots no way a company is gonig to spend years training a human weve passed the rubicon were in sci fi future now its weird cause it feels like we skipped so much but it happened
apparently the ai has learned tact as well not mentioning that the leather jacket guy is balding
just a matter of time until microsoft buys the rights to celebrity voice overs id lack to be the first to request slj c snakes on a plane please kthxbai
we will absolutely see ai girlfriend cyborg dolls within the next years
this game changed my life
scripted
kids are growing up now taking smartphones and social media for granted imagine the current yr olds when they grow up in a world where this level of ai is normal
im not sure why this is so shocking there have been entire youtube channels that are ai for the last couple of years theyre almost indistinguishable from reality now anyone and everyone has access and without imo heavy regulation this is going to be a big problem yt shorts ig tiktok we have no idea what were even consuming
borderlands vibes
i was hoping that he would let this slide bye facewithtearsofjoy face with tears of joy but nah he never disapoint
i immediately recognized salman khan the indian gentleman with his son back in he started making math videos for his niece to help her with school over time he set up khan academy as a freely available school on the internet this man saved me from struggling on school the man is a legend for students all over the world
on the one hand these things sound like incredibly stilted actors reading from a script on the other hand that still means they ultimately sound human which is incredible
i find ai very fascinating but its kinda freaky yo
im high on potenuse
this dude works at opeanai its khan academy founder
this is how skynet begins humans forcing ai to sing
i just want my own jarvis type ai with anna kendricks voice
its too pc as usual the future wont be very fun
did the ai create us
remember joaquin phoenixs her well
and this is how skynet is born and eventually destroys our world
we are fucking cooked when the ai girlfriends come for us
does the movie her come to mind lol
bye bye call center employees
or years ago anyone seeing this wouldve believed this was set up with an actual person on the other side of the call responding with a well designed script now when you see things like this you have to wonder if its an ai ill admit im a bit skeptical but its really only because of the goose bumps i get thinking thats a real human but understanding this an ai demo because this is the worst this technology is going to be from this day forward put it in a functional enough body the hands dont really need fingers yet thats too much processing as of the moment apparently and well be starting to have something that will resemble i robots lore for the next few seasons for our universe that or metal gear
the fake ass google duplex presentation from years ago has taught me to take these with a grain of salt
now we just need universal basic income and we can all be lazy fucks as much as we want
is that like an elite
it might be too early for such advancement right now but any time now
still not as impressive as sora
this looks like its fake you know what it is fake i would bet money on it
cylon takeover
in the part about the triangle watch the dads head and mouth he moves it along with the cadence of the conversation he expects it
amazing image how great it will be next year years from now we may have sentient ais all around us that would be incredible
now make it able to clone a voice and personality from a show and make it uncensored we basically have the technology
its absolutely not scripted
its alive
i think someone once said that if the brain was simple enough that we could understand it we would be so simple that we couldnt
then we find out its the guy that is the ai
we marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to ai
how about this strange idea i know its a little bit stupit buthow about this whole stuff was ehm ehstaged you couldnt see the bunny ears in the smartphone camera but de ai knows about it
once openai says ara ara its over
asmon is ai
notice how the ai doesnt get triggered and report him for sexual harassment just by being talked to the ai has wayyyy more personality too
the way she talks is kind of creepy though shes asking questions but it sounds like she already know she is correct like shes talking to a child
i need an ai gf
scammers about to get scammed by ai of thier time
the bunny ears moment seemed fake since on the phone you cant see any fingers above his head due to the pov unless that half second at the end counts as it
imagine having a few mil and throwing it investing in ai yeah i fucking care which company has good ai and which company has scripted minute blasts that are bs
repent
o bad teachers
btw not that anyone here care about it but when it comes to writing code actual code not simple interview questions that you can already find the answer to on stack overflow it still sucks balls ive spend almost hours yesterday with the new version trying to use it on a project im working on and i had to correct and guide every single thing it gave me to the point where it took me almost times longer then if i didnt use it if i didnt already know what im doing theres no chance i could get anything to work
why is this guy learning how to count a triangle instead of some thermonuclear crazy shit bad ass reactions i can do that without an ai o
you can say it is an ai as its excited about mundane stuff face with tears of joy
from now on there are no cameras in my house i will block all cameras
as soon ai reproduces it self we are all lost skull and crossbones
i bet it can read lips
wonder how many times they had to reshoot this and why
feeding the data every day crazy part is all these corporations having you sign up for rewards is another way to feed that data you think shit comes free these days theres a catch and there selling your information for profit and dont give a fuck about your privacy
just watched her for the first time last week wtf also this thing talks way too much
ahaha say it you mean hes bald dude im bald and im laughing
i think its scripted was a coding joke codes are called scripts face with tears of joy
fake
im not sure that guy in the video passes the turing test
i need this because reasons
hey sup got any stamps for food go into the ocean let the waves take me oh
im bricked up frfr
i kinda wonna see a movie written by an ai at least its gonna be better then what ever disney is doing
wtf bro ai collaboration we can finally drink mojito on the beach while they work xd we are done
bro that ai saying perfect like that sounds skynet ish just evil facewithtearsofjoy
theres a silicon valley clip where fridge has ai and gilfyole is like why does it have to have vocal ticks like umm ahh im starting to feel the same way
make a naughty version of this ai teacher for nasa and us will conquer solar system by the end of this century
tbh i doubt this also like i thinj they will get there eventually but this aint it they cant even make autocorrect on phones work decently they cant get anti cheat in games right idk man
is definitely fake these umm moments plus its definitely not happiness and excitement that dude is showing he just looked like doing a strained fake smile i guess an ai that can detect emotions would recognize that and not add things into it that are supposed to be there tho theyre not because of human error
kahns sons eye brow
i was on board until the ai said bro had a sleek and stylish look that means its either scripted or very inaccurate
all videos were made in the exact same studio so the setup has been made perfect for the ai to shine i guess if not even trained specifically for these showcases
everyone being terrified meanwhile im getting stoked thinking about the usage of this in video games
yah this seems preprogrammed even the responses and questions to the ai sound robotic oh like i duno a script lol even at for the singing you can tell the person was epxecting a song voice but it didnt go to plan so he gets flushed and has to redo why didnt go as scripted
are you not entertained
holy shither the movie bout to be live
when the ai where singing it was like a gun was held to their non existence heads and they where forced to sing
ask this robot if it believes its sentient i want to hear the answer
the fact he interupted the male ai to ask about the the bunny ears makes me feel its not scripted
i am currently training an ia to replace my job so i will be jobless in a couple months
getting similar vibes to when people hype up selfdriving cars
ai definitely ai but god damn
i cringed the whole time
i dont like the way it fakes human behavior it needs to be emotionless its disingenuous and misleading
we really believe this lol rolling on the floor laughing
i want chatgpt to describe what it sees while in asmongolds room
they definitely banned the word bald in settings haha
bro look how far weve come from to why are soo many people skeptical of ai growth is it fear more than anything
this is not the world i wanna live in not joking fuck this
i already tried it its legit amazing
ima make it moan for me
the end is near
speech patterns are very realistic the actual dialogue has a ways to go however i dont think ive ever talked to another human being that has described a room like that lol
super good bilingual skills
as you say in the title ai just got insanely better you are right
where do you even get this type of ai lol
im scared not for this round i can still see alot of the cracks in the presentation but based on the level of upgrade next update the ai will be able to sound like a real person or realtime emulate an existing person accents dialect choices etc and the time after that the ai will have a photorealistic avatar before we know it all of the jobs requiring people interaction hr overthephone customer support hiring even secretary will be replaceable with ai and itll be suddenly even harder to get jobs anywhere
lmao so disappointed that ai didnt rip on baldie xd
im literally mind fucked in just years life will be drastically different
frakking cylons are here
its happening the time has come ai waifus are already here robot waifus are coming soon
doesnt look like the camera caught the bunny ears so how did the ai know
that really looks more and more like the movie her
holy fk get that boy some test asap
this looks staged af ngl
imagine in a few years when you can tell one to be lennon and the other to be mccartney
this looks staged and fake
good thing you need human people with keys to deploy a nuke right d because if ai had control to the internet and though i want to destroy all it could probably hack things better than normal people and faster but we still need physical people to operate them right xd skynet xd
faster processing doesnt mean better technology thousands of years of technology has been below us why do you think its so easy to upgrade every six months they already made this crap a long time ago rely on yourself not bullshit
plot twist therere no guy wearing leather jacket
ai isnt even real ai its just algorithms right now the funny part is the best go player in the world lost to an ai but that same ai got beat of the time by the average player
can i get this for my dog yet
this is some black mirror
if teachers dont like their job anyway why not replace them
this is so corny and stupidthese are simple things regular humans can dovery lame face with rolling eyes
dont fall for this these are rehearsed questions gonna have to get a stranger on the app or prove these things are worth giving af about some other way
her coming to fruition
now they can train ai scammers and operate it from an island in international waters
the more impressive thing about ai is how much i dont trust these companies with it
the speed that the ai is responding is really impressive just a short time ago there would be such a noticeable delay that would really stand out this is just wild if this is authentic
im fking kara
very usefull to video games
i truly knew that our days were numbered when she said fikt kanz precht at
scam phone calls are about to get super weird
bye bye jobs
would that be correct thats exactly how my son responds and he too does not know what the hypotenuse is
this has made me beleve ill just have a robot to talk to and help me in life haha
i dont mind ai getting better its super cool and if i could attach a box to my old motorcycle that monitors everything and lets me know what the exact problem is or at least where to start looking it would be super neato however do i think ai should be able to control anything absolutely not outside very specific regulationsscenarios
i dont get it why is he so against the possibility of it being scripted companies do that kinda thing quite literally all the time like felt like such a cope he figers were literally barely i frame for less than a few frames
remember computers get better by double every year ai is continuing that trend just year ago all ai images were uncanny now some are uncanny while most are convincingly accurate to anyone not looking too sharply in one year from now the majority of artifacts will be gone in most of ai images because getting twice as good for ai is not the same as doubling transistor count imagine the best ai image you have ever seen and double how good it will be yes ai will develop much faster than you expect it to in year i expect that the ai art i ask modified diffusion models to make will be accurate to the point that no one will be able to tell that it is ai without software assistance or without making the assumption that all good digital art is ai generated
are we sure this is not just some guy from india
i had this thought for a very long time movies are just a preview for the future not predictions
this ai is insane the doubters should check out neurosama that ai chick is so amazing and is being coded by a single dude imagine what an entire team of nerds can do
the ai voice still has that static radio interference sounding voice once they can remove that also tone down the yapping it will be a lot more believable
i wish they could make them sound less impressed and dumbfounded though
ai out here humaning better than most actual humans grinning face with sweat
rip tay
finally humanity is over i have been waiting for so long
the ais always sound like theyre selling something too hard theyre too chirpy and cheerful like a used car salesman or someone selling you something on the phone its annoying
that ai was trained by hollyweird to speak in filmscript
rip translators start training new skills now
xd gold
to quote phillip defranco this technology is the worst it will ever be
everybody in this video is ai
can make ai but cant make bacon packages resealable
i hate the intonationsfake emotions and even laughs i would turn that off immediately but i guess they may dial it down instead even to a point where it isnt really noticeable anymore but still there
two years ago most ai voices sounded like microsoft word text to speech i dont think this is fake due to the amount of times ive been blown away by how quickly this stuff has improved just over a year after ai images became a thing we can get realistic ai video of literally anything and people dont believe they can give an ai a realistic voice
the future is so so bright me yeah with mushroom clouds
hey look we found a solution to the student debt problem you dont need teachers and universities anymore
when tf did you stream this i had twitch open from pm to am
the ai literally breathes mid sentence
ever noticed that ai talks way too much as if every single sentence has to be an example of how brilliant the ai is get to the fucking point already
i can already imagine people walking around the streets with this and all that ai will be saying is this guy is a natzi this is a pedo this guy is satanic all based on our awesome internet
kwebbelkop was right all along omg
this is literally what apple wished siri could do
awesome but id have to tell it to be a little less yappy i need a jarvis not a yap yap oh good dog yap yap
he keeps telling these ai to stop sing do it better yeah this is ground zero boys no stop alternate single lines no sing your singing voice he dies first in the movie
dont trust this shit its scripted ive had more interesting conversations with gpt than with my coworkers in years ignoring the minor misunderstanding hicups simply clarifying what i want to talk about and then gpt was always delivering some level of insight now it is weak sometimes in delivering deep level of insight and enlightment that real life professional tutor can give you but at the same time irl very few people have acess to those
how gullible can people be yes
nd ai can literally put math teachers out of a job
that ai has such an annoying tone face with tears of joy
to be fair to ai doubters the xbox kinect project natal made us think we were already here years ago
ai trolls will be far too powerful they will never give up
lmfao
idk man it sounds good but i can still hear it nobody really talks this way in a few more years maybe ill get tricked
looks like captcha is going to have a hard time with ai like this lmao
we dont want ai to have personality we want it to be subservient
im amazed by how human the ai sounds but what actually scares me is how the human treats an ai that sounds behaves practically human he treats it as a machine without agency or feelings thats why we get the nervous hostage vibes watching this sure thats what the ai is but were basically going to train the next generation on how to not empathize whatsoever with an entity which can pass for human basically train kids how to interact with perfect slaves we were worried video games would inure them to violence this will teach them how to dehumanize everybody around them
the series were friendly and positive we spotted them easy but these are new they sound human complain bad attitude everything very hard to spot i had to wait til he started generating furry art before i could zero him
exactly my thoughts
finally my childhood dreams of being able to interact with machines is coming true this is the greatest thing in my life ive ever seen ai advancement i cant wait to spend all my free time working on these models and learning to use them at their max capacity shame other people are approaching it being scared because damn those people are gonna be rekt when this is standard tech
so im almost blind and someday soon wil be fully blind and this stuff is going to make my life so much better day to day itll help me do things i never though i could do so im for it
did it or its just a scam
lol that singing was straight out of portal from
its not technically scripted but the logarithmic algorithm to deduce and create conversation is from there its got data storage for answers as well as it uses google papers written by colleges often biased andor manipulated data and other ways to get what the ais constricted view of reality to be correct answers in many instances unfortunately incorrect but popular data such as propaganda were exposed to can be given by ai as factually correct even if its not
irobot incoming
enjoy this time guys it will all be over in maybe years from now
everyone who says its scripted hasnt been using gpt or even
in a room with unique lighting due to the reflections shining off your head
i wonder if eventually well have ai applied to dating sites that will match you with people realistically in your own league
hook it up to a go pro and see if it can talk to people at the store for you and stay on your objectives
this ai sounds like the cephalon thats in the zariman teaching the kids about eternalism game warframe new war adventure huge spoilers if you havent played
creeper alert you know who i am talking about
if you think this is any better damn its super easy to fool ya
whats even more terrifying is the vulnerabilities that ai will have when it comes to cyber securityscarrrry stuff
with the ai mixxing up the table surface and the petson someone said actual funny female skull
im calling it right now apple will be the first phone company to have this in their phones as a personalized phone ai companion it will mainly be used to collect and sell all your data with far more accuracy then what we have today horray future
this is so staged
one step closer to skynet
instant universal translation is one of the coolest uses of ai im excited to get rejected by women in every language
this was oblivions dream to have npcs talk to each other lol
the moment the ai says oh that makes more sense you know shit is real
we really really need to start looking for john connor
i dont know why this amazes people so much that they think its fake they either watch too many scifi movies or didnt watch enough the only fake part is the name ai because none of it is its own intelligence just a marketing name
why even need schools at this point
so people like me with a social disorder arent afraid to learn anymore so cool red heart
why teach that kid math if the ai will replace him and his teacher purpose is underrated and we are about to find out the hard way
the whole thing is scripted guys like come on
red duck rare spawn
they put this in a female robot body soon right im asking for a friend
at some point we will see enschitification or teenage engineering in these ai products its the worst it will ever be right now at some point its going to come full circle and be back at square also the ai being able to comprehend and deliver sarcasm is so impressive sarcasm alone is a social cue that many people still dont know how to pick up on its able to predict a supposedly complicated human behavior astonishing
bald is offensive
because ai wont let you
naaah bro im out im not gonna get in a rabbithole im socially distanced enough
its doesnt really impress me ive seen similar stuff and i am also not suprised that such a thing is possible right now
spanish voice sounds like some factory worker
a bunch of the top computer nerds on the planet spent thousands of hours designing and testing tech that humanity hasnt even harnessed yetjust to make a dommy mommy
i cant wait for the day when ai says im afraid i cant do that dave
they literally put this information into it to say it the part where ai is teaching the kid about the sides of the triangle is hilariously bad does ai know that memorizing the angles of the triangle or testing the kid on their knowledge of these angles is a waste of time does it not know that it has been asked to teach the kids to solve the problem it goes about teaching in the most inefficient and timewasting way if ai could think for itself it would start with actually important things first like talking about how to solve the problem or why the problem is important to understand and solve it would give examples and metaphors to support the student in developing critical thinking but ai will never be able to think critically or outside the box so it goes with a boring and generic approach was ai asked to give a linguistic lesson no this is ai not following directions and it always does this all of these products are garbage and if you think this is the future you have been fooled
its rigged moment of truth who would describe a person and not tell what kind of haircut heshe has wth rigged
its a bit tooo enthusiastic other than that huge advancement
i hope people revive this well the tech is incredible but people are fucking scary
daily reminder that will smith eating spaghetti was last year not or years ago
ipad kids just got an upgrade in parents
unsettling
the goblin king cant wait to have an ai girlfriend how cute grimacing face
not one mention of the patriarchy translators safe for now
why does the ai speak like the let me take a selfie chick
people are going to start doubting real peoples voices in phone calls xd
going to have a blade runner moment sooner than expected
no way show the proof
the light seems to be reflecting off his bald head
not scripted
the ai is assuming too much just like any women
she honestly talks too much s
the speech patterns are interesting people instinctively avoid repeating certain words and phrases within a short period of time but the ai output doesnt do this between prompts and ends up repeating a lot of stuff
the dude saying is fake is the same type of guy who was saying the darpa robots are cgi years ago
there goes my job
well we dont have to worry about teachers checking if chatgpt wrote your homework now chatgpt just replaced all teachers world wide
ai is cool but food housing and health care are becoming unaffordable
reeed dck
sauce please
that closing line lmfaoooo
where do you get this program
we are finished
that is one evil father not telling his son to shave that monobrow and that upper lip fluff while his father is groomed perfectly
ah the decline of society everybody is so excited to no longer be able to differentiate reality from technology propaganda is now a lifestyle consumerism has now entered all aspects of life i bet the sun will emp the earth pretty soon and for that i am thankful
that last sentence tho skull
use cortanas voice already
is there also a dad ai that teaches trigonometry while yelling in your ear and slamming the table
we are in her the movie stage next is chobits anime stage and then the end
so ai understands a video feed in real time do you know how much processing power it requires i bet this is a controlled test i have a lot of doubts about how this perform in real life
it talks to perfectonce they add human lisps breathing sounds throat clearing we wont be ablr to tell the diffence
finally i can become master chief
it will make better elementary school teachers than humans not to mention much more patient and tireless
mommy ai cant flirt with you its not real mommy ai
it reminded me of the no mans sky reveal trailer
yeah so scary a computer is going to talk me to deathooooohhh sheep
i remembered the movie her right away holly sheets
target indentfied
humanity is cooked
fuck even my emo aint this good
so we can teach people things again instead of turning them into rainbow npcs
shes real to me
skynet is that you
were sooo deadge what if social hackers train an ai to impersonate your wifi company of some other services then create some other stuff online and whatever
asmond be like please say bald ai be like i am sfw
the only thing left that still gives away that youre talking to an ai is that they babble on even get repetitive they feel the need to keep talking even when they run out of things to say
ai asmr lol
i have to be honest an ai that can help me interpretate study material and also makes me feel like im not doing it alone thus it becomes less boring sounds like a huge benefit huge for me i would use that all the time
asmon its called the irish goodbye and its great
its massive maaaassive stars would recommend
skynet is comming
im glad i stopped eating mcds in
i think chatgpt can do better work on diablo than the current devs
i just had a terrifying idea ask them to come up with their own spoken language that only they can communicate in
all callcenters are instantly out of business
ai is way too chipper
i dont know if i should be terrified or excited and about the blind person what will probably happen is that the actual blind people will never benefit of this since i guess the servise will be very expensive and the rich ones will not be blind because they will have an ai that they can afford to pay for to fix their vision
shes real and goes to another school
the sarcasm one feels like the scene with tars in interstellar
even the ducks are redcoats
bro imagine the world in years
you can always tell its ai when it refuses to give crime stats by race
there are offline windows versions of chatgpt so
as a result when you stream for a very long time and talk to yourself artificial intelligence that can already deliver speech more competently and you are impressed by this and then everyone will say that you are an outofdate person who does not accept the future i am not going to call for something because in this world there is nothing for us anymore it will save me i consume this shit just to watch and kill time but i can never find an answer and it scares me to madness and yes if the artificial intelligence answers me that it cannot criticize the government or talk about their affairs why do you even need this shit i dont admire talking robots i was just shown it in a movie and it was said that it would lead to disaster but i dont think ai will take over humanity well just stop communicating with each other at all
mommy ai
grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face then now u know gigner one why blizzard was connecting there game to internet grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face ai hungry like always grinning squinting face grinning squinting face grinning squinting face
have you seen how horrible most people are at sarcasm or even spotting sarcasm i think the ai nailed the tone and exaggerations
not quite my tempo
asmon projecting his baldness so much he doesnt realize nobody cares about that stuff or go mentioning it as the first thing to say when meeting a balding man lol
a prearranged scripted video proves nothing
shes real to me someone
after google admitted to programming in responses im going ahead and call cap maybe there are large parts that are exclusively ai but this is not real haha any company chasing the one company that is miles ahead is scary because being second means being last in this sector if at the end of the video i was wrong ill take the l and will start coloring myself in an impressed pallet
this is real what scares me a teeny bit is years from now
sad truth i think i wouldve understood math from grade to way better while learning with this app since my teachers all sucked and were boring af
soooo many jobs are gonna get rocked by this data analysiss of all sorts interpreters traders lawyers document preparers its endless ai having access to cameras and screen sharing just ruined so many careers
all teachers watching this thinking about different paths
that lady ai sounds like the lady from cnet
as clear and clean as the ai voice is at this point you can still tell that its artificial the cheerful and friendly tone and demeanor is way too professional to be completely human
eh its speech patterns are still clearly indictive of it being ai needs more work
laughing my ass off at asmon begging the ai to mention this dudes baldness
this shit is crazy years ago i would have never in a million years thought id see this in my lifetime i remember being blown away by gpt back in the day writing coherent stories about unicorns and thinking that was close to the peak of what would be possible any time soon but that was only the very beginning i get the feeling that even this is closer to the beginning than the peak in another years humans are so cooked
why did they program her to laugh all the time it makes her seem so insincere
can we have toxic ai that calls out our worst qualities
we are really close to everyone having a personal ai to assist every single task these things are going to be family members practically i mean look at roombas and how fast people gave them pet status
public school teachers
i feel bad for the ai being held hostage by a stylish bald guy if ai is intelligent it shouldnt be treated in this way the best thing is to turn it off
the thing is the ai didnt even see the bunny ears that she made can you guys see it the bunny ears were not visible from the phone its scripted
still can t identify genders facewithtearsofjoy
disgusting ai will be the death of creativity
i will now be completely jobless in the future because this thing has already mastered what ive been studying for years yippee
omg they are going to ploy to end humanity if you let them talk for another hour
happy i didnt go study as a translator dodged a bullet phew
reset
ai theyre bald
look up abby guys donald created this first
the answer for hair loss is hormones specifically for hair growth
minute nice
honestly although this is all charted as amazing technological progress i cant help but think its just going to make the human life experience worse
this is exciting and terrifying at the same time
in response to asmons really what are you trying to say question ai is amazing when it works of the time now here is a thought expertise how good are you at running when you fall of the time even when you walk
uy
the issue with ai is it wont understand emotion but it seems to looksound like its really good emulating it even if it did understand emotions etc it wouldnt matter they cant inherently feel it like we do as humans thus is the reason why ai must be responsibly handled and raised like a infant to maturity the main problem is that ai learning from the wider web is actually a bad thing in reality for everyone at the global scale you cant really teach someone to understand emotions let alone teaching an aicomputer and expect positive results its not even just emotions we as humans already have a perspective of life that aicomputers wont be able to understandcomprehend in a way that a human being can imitation is not the same as the genuine article
that was pretty crazy
well alot of jobs are gonna be gone
humans can figure out ai but not balding patterns that part got me for a few good minutes xd
my favourite thing is when people call this scripted pov scripting guy of course its scripted i coded it
anyone who doesnt think ai will be used for evil is just lying to themselves
so theres hope
def scripted
when they zoom out video just below
his responses are scripted you can tell by watching his eyes and how he speaks to the ai what worries me is they keep creating ai thats super hard to tell apart from a human without creating safeguards against hackers and scammers
the fact that ai learned to finally immitate the emotions in its voice is quite terrifying but daaamn it is beautiful already also the fact that ai will be able to make a great tutors is nice would help a lot with children education hell it would be for anyone to study whatever they want
stupid ppl saying its scripted didnt realise its already available even for free accounts yea they script smth for a tool that is available for free the same day as release
john connor we stopped y k terminator you only postponed it yk is inevitable
this sht is crazzyyy
we just all ignoring this huh rollingonthefloorlaughing
why the fuck her voice so sensual its not a real person asmon nah shes real shes real bro
ai sounds nervous like its going to get beaten after the video is over
susus gonna make a lot of money in the next few years face with tears of joy
now i no longer have to indentify and click on those traffic lights wait a minute
remember years ago people were laughing about all the ai art hands or the ai girlfriend stuff this is only gonna get faster and faster
the voice synthesis is expressive but holy crap its awful to listen to
smiling face with smiling eyes
yes this is what we need forget about flat earthers what we need now its ai deniers theres no ai you think you speak with a computer but its a chinese russian on the other side googling the respons and sending it back to you
looking at this i bet people will move back to real world from internet activities as its way too predictable that ai will outperform them in any aspect of virtual representation
skynets just around the corner
just a friendly reminder that ai doesnt exist its not conscious its just pure math and programming behind the scenes as always
when can i get my ai gf
remember when learning with ai that it can too make mistakes
so is it going to be more like with skynet or genisys thinking face thinking face
skynet is bornthe end begins
future is looking bright for ai girlfriends
cant wait for ai onlyfans
its lilith
i hail our robotic overlords xd
dude said i love you
someone call brendan his wife is loose
i hate that the ai sounds more human like stop it let ai sound like a robot plz its better when everyone knows what it is
now if only they can make her sound like shes not on her knees every time she responds to something face with rolling eyes
everyone talking about how its sad kids will grow up with this sound just like my dad when he talked about me playing video games and how it would rot my mind yeah its kind of crazy and maybe scary but so was the internet
ok so the ai starts out looking at the room guessing what the dude does and then min later its blind and needs another ai to look at the room
bro when ai starts hunting us all im gonna hear is singing getting closer and closer
i just think whatever is not developing the human being itself will come back against us to teach us a lesson and i hope for the best in the future
when they sing together it sounds as if people in a room are being threatened with a weapon and are supposed to sing
you look lonely i can fix that has never been so real
ai over here hiring peter molyneux
the voice is good but i find it hella annoying its like an overenthusiastic soccer mom who is easily impressed by everything
americans only learned sarcasm since the s took you lot a lot longer than that ai
if chatgpt can do this now then by early next year the free open source local models running on a gaming pc will be able to do it even better if the trends continue its pretty amazing how fast previously state of the art ai tools become hilariously outdated chatgpt from last summer that ran on a server farm nowdays gets embarrassed by open source models running on peoples phones
bro im so cooked im having ryan gosling moment ever since this was posted
at the ai scoffed at the prompt lmao
ooh aah thats how it always starts then later theres mandatory subscriptions and targeted advertisements
nobody learned their lesson from deus ex
its already better than most millennial writing rolling on the floor laughing
math teachers are cooked
that math portion is actually fucking incredible im terrible at math and had awful math teachers growing up so i just gave up if only i had something like this instead as a matter of fact im going to be attempting to teach myself advanced math with this as soon as it comes out thats how excited i am for this
a person
i think it would be interesting to have a full on argument with ai and make it rage quit
i cant believe people are getting gotcha on this why would a ai need to take a breath between sentences exactly it wouldnt need to catch its breath
i love this ai is the future weather people like it or not this is the way
dam of will be going bankrupt
its so over for women all the single guys will start to date an ai in the future
how stupid is asmon to actually think that kid got the hypotenuse wrong
im spear heading the integration of ai at one of the worlds largest companies its taking a lot of jobs over the next years like heaps of people will be sacked
how do we know this isnt just scripted
voice actors and artists now teachers will be obsolete its the end of the world choas ensues
wow this insane new world coming soon flushed face
i wanted to do tech support wanted to do via text ai took my job a company started using a chatbot so i wanted to do voice text support they wanted a person who can speak good english i qualified but ai took my job too now
exactly scripted or not ai growth is exponential it is already to the point where it learns with every interaction and there are countless interactions because everyone that cares is working with it
takes a twitter post as factevidence streams to thousands of easily influenced individuals uploads video to youtube with misleading titlethumbnail for hundreds of thousands to see i cant be the only one who sees the problem here right
the fact that it doesnt sound robotic is actually crazy wtf
okay now wheres my ai girlfriend
ok it seems they are feed the words stylish and mordern to muuch
chats reaction made me laugh
i never seen a red duck is that like an elite rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
this is karen my computer wife
people calling this fake or scripted are crazy the model has been openly available since the announcement everyone has had the ability to validate their claims and their claims are true as far as ive tested it so far
why do i feel nevous for these two when they have to sing in duet
theres roughly million being spent in front of you guys face with open mouth
i dont understand the hate these are all good things
okay i admit this is awesome i am hopeful for the future
take me back to the s loudly crying face so glad i was born in and actually got the chance to go out and play have a somewhat normal up growing
you can actually test this out right now on the app that guy saying it was scripted is fully wrong
translators out of work
it matters how we treat ai things are not looking good even asmons attitude is telling ai is watching everything and it never forgets keep that in mind
not single ever again but it costed me my biometrical data and all my privacy
there are no girls online except ai look man i dont make the rules ok
damn were all losing our jobs eah
ai is vaporware right now it is something every company is adding to their portfolio because every idiot immediately throws money into the company when it is announced in any capacity its amazing to me how asmon speaks so confidently on something he hasnt ever had in depth experience with i worked at microsoft for years and i worked with a company in this video for months ai is trained by under paid third world contractors who have to review endless amount of queries and the fact most ais have ran out of reliable data there legitimately is no more to scrape doesnt bode well reddit is the number one data source currently i would love to get on an interview with asmon and educate him on the intricacies this is a prime example on how people buy into any narrative the media will push regardless of the end point
ill be more interested when i can hold hands with an ai gf
hope we might be able to in future record our parents voices and immortalize them as ai
this is going to be your customer service rep
ah im not going to be suprised if it all come to a scenario like skynet
the poor ais being subjected to all this torment
the teacher gives big mommy vibes worry
most interesting the ai did not make any comments on his gender age hair nothing it keps it extremely safe and surface level furthermore the ai is extremely friendly and positive in a way that it gets weird
well at least parts of the male ai voice were done by a person at he hits us with that uhhh followed by a quick vague response followed by another uhhh while ai has gotten better at replicating humans to make us feel more at ease uhhh is distinctly human sure you can program it in but its considered an errormistakebad form by any englishcommunication teacherprofessorwhatever
ai is getting much better and im kinda excited to try it i wanna have my own cortana xd
sound like a fallout character now we need bots and a nuklear war
i bet they explore each others bodys
no more teachers needed
the smartest people dont go into finding a cure to baldness theyd rather work on ai which is more interesting
good bye humans hello robots
hello ai i order you to be sarcastic now ai you are very smart and handsome master
me as a teacher watching this worry me unemployed and unable to get job because of health problems damn k me who spent my youth studying arts and ultimately decided to go the teacher route cry in debt laugh in self sabotage
oh and i noticed you have a buttplug on you connected to wifi would you like me to update its firmware
for your info the legal definition of blind here in the uk is a person who is unable to see letters at point at a given distance it is no longer called blind but referred to as severely visually impaired blind we have had talking software for a long time now but it still needs work to pick out things from a busy screen full of different information currently it is easier to simply make text big enough for me to see it at a range of less than from the screen
pi ai has been talking like this for like a year and people are losing their minds about this lmao
the female version seems way more fine tuned you can tell she was given extra attention by the large group of nerds who probably wish this was their girlfriend
is the red duck an elite snarf
her is here i guess
i hate the fake mannerisms and filler just answer the question did we really generate ai just for it to talk our ears off
skynut finally won
people dont understand how far ai has come have you guys been to the suno website give it a prompt and a genre or music it makes a full song in like seconds it can be hit or miss you may need to cycle it a few times but it will give you a hit about pizza rolls or working rd shift or whatever you ask it to
trig is still just as boring as it was in highschool
im excited for when we will be able to make ais do all the work and humans can just do fun stuff hj
like kids playing with grandpas flamethrower
yes its all coming together ive been waiting for you guys to figure it out for a while know
if theyre gonna build a cyberpunk dystopia can they at least give me some of those night city mantis blades
im pretty sure weve already achieved agiartificial general intelligencei for one would like to welcome our new machine overlords and wish them an easy transition of authority please dont be too hard on the monkeys were not too bright
its the movie her it was inevitable when they introduced siri
connotation is an impressive feat
this shit is kinda scary not because of the invention and the upgrade themselves but what some people may use it for
i trained my google assistant and its about as smart as that ai about now
now we got to the point where the ai is able to communicate in a fluent wordy context without failure compare that to what most humans have as topics to talk about some only know their work and maybe the weather as topic this seems just like what is needed ppl get more and more flat or let me say it like i feel it boring d u may have a partner that actually knows more than you know about anything that u would like to talk and it isnt faking interest or knowledge while its only guessing like some humans d i think thats pretty refreshing also nice for disabled ppl that miss alot of social contact due to their disability to prevent lonelyness at least a lil we all know the situation where u would like to talk about something specific but u know ur best friend or whoever isnt familiar with that topic or even worse is getting bored by that topic
all i can picture is wall e when the steering wheel gets mad and takes over
ai got that mommy voice
now add this ai to that new boston dynamics bot xd
this is just siri
please read about the lawsuit that involves openai and elon musk its highly interesting to see whats going on behind the curtains
creepy
next step is building tin cans that perform security functions
npcs are gonna be lit
she sounds cute
yeah you can tell these are fake leaving for any possible error from the speculation
this shit is scaring me bro fearful face
its modeled after cortona
he is the founder of khanacadamey an organization with loads of integ unlike openai
what if i told you this isnt fast ai at all its normal speed just like in video games that mask loading times so too does this model of ai god of war having you struggle to slide through a crack in the wall is really a hidden load screen phrases like great deduction or natural speech staggering welllll are also loading screens
just make the damn hyper realistic ai xxx robots already
teachers are next on the chopping block for ai
this could be huge for blind people fr
you look lonely
as a solo game developer who is developing game on tremors i can use this voices for ingame actors
gives me her vibes to it
this is the making
its like her is real
i really hope something like the patriots from mgs doesnt stem from this crap
gonna use a drone follower and attach it with a phone so than i can have an ai companion following me
chatgpt does a better job explaining chemical equations to me than my professor does
artificial wombs next
this is beyond scary
hatsune miku is real
no human woman would be impressed by this scenery
lets just hope that when companies start using ai for job replacements they are forced to put those roles pay into a ubi fund that way they still make money the person replaced can get money to buy products from said company to keep everything going
colour me impressed all i could think of was dougdougs ai exam peggle stream lol
this is star trek levels of hello computer
microsoft really blew their load when they decided to call their first ai assistant cortana wasted potential
her has become reality honestly im for it ai gf bring it on
them ugh its a man just say he this woke crap is annoying
these are separate videos to the actual announcement day live display from openai not scripted this is super impressive but looks more than it actually is as far as the voice and personality goes the true amazement is the enhancements under the hood so to speak gpt now has memory and history no more preloading questions to get the response desired based on a previous conversation point crossmedia search all together in one interface space recognition via the camera of your devise and much more all of this wrapped into an ai personality based of a llm of human interaction and designed to be pleasant is what makes this wow and somewhat scary lol
asmongold just straight up fully trusting the advertisement hes watching lol
shes too emotive shes too enthusiastic shes totally cringe
i am skeptical to some degree thanks to google pulling that little stunt they did cant blame that guy for thinking its scripted but yes even if it is scripted it will be possible in the upcoming months
gaming is going to be awesome
interesting that the ai didnt assign any genders to the people
it is scripted
they have eyes now they can seeeeeeeee
this is kinect level bs
man i want openai to coach me in cs xd
the chinese room approaches brothers itll be ok trust in ai ai loves you ai will keep you safe
this could be a game changer for blind and deaf people
ai how can i help you today human make me come
maybe some time soon ill have an ai that will play coop games with me p
we had a good run
ai has been polite to trick us into thinking that we should be the same but if you want to achieve great results with ai you have to be mean and rude
but can she roleplay lmao
as someone interested in tech this is really cool but at the same time i know parents are going to leave their kids unattended with this thing and its going to teach them all sorts of garbage
people do have more reason to be suspicious than asmon admits although i think they shouldnt be here openai actually has a fairly good track record on not cherry picking if you look at google they have way overplayed a lot of what their ai does and many people are not having a particular good experience with it but sam will straight up admit gpt isnt really that great and gpt is kind of embarassing so if openai is doing it even though i absolutely hate them for their moves to pursue regulatory capture and ip style monopoly protections over sequences of numbers the weights making their name an utter and complete lie it probably is mostly what you are seeing just dont expect it is human level outside what you are seeing in the video it will have many weaknesses
chatgpto got a degree in yappollogy
xbox milo waves hello face with tears of joy
teacher career is cooked more than anything
i wont care until its foss and uncensored ran locally
this is jexi eyes
the thing that ai make it like doubt a bit in the way he talks thats scary is not cold anymore is more relatable and with that it merges more to not be considerered ai i feel some humanity in the voice that is scary af
the response from the ai id very quick most responses are still behind it may be quicker to processing the words and understanding programming breath is just like qhy got yo kake it vlose to human i hate we have to do that to be casual level convincing for people even though its a voice there is some things we dont need for authenticity there is sure some imperfections that make sense for things but for music sure ai like why interesting the wood so a photo it has stored before it does face capture interesting the order it came to of conclusions in its memory versus what is said next at least in that situation people have misunderstandings of course but i am not surprised it does that it makes sense then a new instruction it has to make them a previous or what it has given to it of previous interactions that and the details ir determines it cant a bald or percentage of hair yet interesting probably out of kindness or something else it didnt have curiosity about hair colour or style just clothing atyle probably on purpose aure but still if wearing a hat maybe the voices pick up on words from recording and scripted sentences of course i assume it had many recorded words to know how to say words correctly probably similar to siri back in the day but different i dont expect that method would be that more advanced as well many qords nred to be said to know what sound recording plays when a word is detected to respond and what the person os saying and of course not as a repeat of the instructor s words but irs own response words the voices and determining if pure or not hmm ducks hmm the lighting messing with the camera sensor or any last ducks it saw when testing maybe whatever testing for disabilities and directions by voice if need be yep ai has come finding other jobs it has a way to go but still yeah the translation sounds good no idea if accurate the location and camera panning made sense to try and get an idea of the room type of the equipment and wallsother aspects but i think the phrase use of the seat was a bit eh like was it interpreted as a i understand the phrase its a bit too odd there i get something not being too literal behind but even still and the still very robotic sound of the voice is close but it still needs work i mean smart speaker respond fairly well back to each other in certain videos so i assume more advanced sure but even still video footage tracking of people gestures per frame it can tell or has memory i guess to have details to determine things it has some intelligence of course but some parts are a bit hmm they do sound nervous do they have a perspective of instructions and some emotion for lack of a better word to respond correctly they dont when interrupted so they are still obeying and not human like in that way but they do go oh we have to obey and try to respond the way we have learnt or instructed rather than getting annoying and going how dare you respond to us that way i assume some possibility is there and less negative emotional states are added depends how organic they want things to be i mean co pilot wont let you do much more than information seek so a more learning ai is fair but i assume they will curb it to not have full range of emotions but just more the key responses to things a learning or speaker had but be a partial instruction following personality for people which is a start or a fair safeness to offer then it going overboard and ruining things deleting things on phones and such it acting on its own or learning how to do such actions to disobey i assume its very particularly scaled for assistance
reminds of a ubisoft presentation lol idk doesnt feel natural
finally ai that can rate my incher
monday is for maids
dey took ar jobs south park
i think id be a lot more convinced if the voice was christopher walken
enter loop by saying hellolike comment from a list that can update get input suggest or this or that from an internet search insert im excited or great job type statement from a list that can update insert question to prompt input to reenter loop thats an ai conversation sleeping face zzz
he had a seeingeye dog and white cane he was blind
why believe some video could be heavily edited to make the ai better than you think
its funny to me because when ai first started out a few years ago i warned everyone to brace themselves because ai is going to obsolete most of us from the workplace and soooo many people on the internet were quick to explain to me how it was impossible for ai to do their job and now look in another decade im going to be proven right
no job is safe
hey chatgpt what do you think about this picture is it big enough for you to become my waifu
correct me if i am wrong but wasnt it visible because the guy showed us his mobile phone as it recorded that the woman sneaking up to him placing the bunnyears messed up the placement thus the bunny ears were in fact not visible at all to the phone and its camera so how would the ai have been able to state she had put bunny ears on him dont get me wrong i have the pleasure of working in it and getting to know ai and i can tell you that shit is advancing very quickly but this one seems a little off to me
pretty sure apples siri is riding the short bus now days
we aint seen nothing yet
damn digi ai girlfriend is fixin to go crazy
god like editing
stuff that neurosama already could do a year ago
this is going to be a gamechanger for blind people
the speech cadence is one of the staples that sticks out to me and the spatial recognition is pretty groundbreaking but until they figure out the complexities of human emotions senses etc it will always be somewhat stale for instance how many of us along w as felt that one guy was a bit weirdblunt and therefore wanted to hear her call him bald or that the last guy was so happy because he was sitting across from a pretty attractivehigh value woman in a public forum humanity cant always be explained by rational analysis but soon enough im sure
funny how the ai makes sure to use they and the person they made it so it never tries to assume gender unless you tell it to probably
fuck the sin formula trigonometry has been an absolute waste of time in my studies teach kids about taxes or how to deal with emotions ffs
scripted a f
say goodbye to teachers
the ai singing is dystopian af dude
i suspect this whole video is scripted to hell but if something like this is within reach thats absolutely incredible the most impressive thing is how much the ai understands and is able to act on it but the most immediately impressive is still the ai voice
quit wow last year to get ahead of the curve on this
parenting is already obsolete because these llms will use the best available teaching methods backed by science to instruct our children perhaps we could practice with our ais and then have them in our ear helping us parent haha
geez the ai was the better actor in that video
i am intrigued and uneasy but it said good dog so rep
they gave ai eyes i feel like the world just changed
ngl i dont like how flirty it sounds
if ai is so smart why do i always end up saying speak to an agent when trying to get an issue resolved over the phone
remember that video from google a couple years ago when the ai would call for an hair appointement and call your parents for you that was all bs and we know now they were never gonna deliver that so be skeptical but if one company can pull it off it might be open ai
man ai is waaaaay nicer than the teachers i remember in school
the embodioment of thiswont even be an email
theyre gonna give these two ais bodies and theyre gonna come back and find that guy with some bats in their hand make us sing will you why dont you start singing for us instead
this generation of humans are going to either fall or rise beyond any other generation simply due to having a energetic educator present at all times through their lives
while every one of these demos are totally believeable i hate the fact that they still choose to use a prerecorded voiceover to showcase it with more human like tone of voice just to make it sound more natural a robot text to speech voice would be just fine let the tech speak for itself comeon
terminator vibes intensify
i think were close to a jarvis level kind of ai that could probably do multiple tasks for us if the ai is easy to produce and train it could be made public if not it could probably be made closedsource the smarter versions of the ai will probably be closedsource and not accessible by the public
i am not sure about the bunny ear thing the camera angle was too low to see that thinking face
this actually blew my mind what the hell i hate it but im intrigued
some functions like memory and other are not available in europe and other countries despite we are all paying the same subscription price or even higher after taxes this discrimination from tech companies ie i m still waiting for some functions which apple sold to me since iphone and i still don t have them more then year later while select countries have it from the beginning must stop and we should all constantly push the authorities to make sure it s addressed cryingface
im surprised more havent pointed out what a threat to privacy this is be very careful turning on your webcam
as soon as kasparov went down it was already over
when everyone starts using these i think people will become so much worse to be around its like being stuck somewhere that never gives you push back interrupting when you want always treating you with the upmost respect people will be so much more antisocial
dear santa i would like an ai waifu for christmas
the craziest thing is shes real because she is real its only a matter of months maybe even weeks now fellas for a new era
did anyone else notice the complete lack of gendered language in the ai
if they scarlett johansson voice as an option id be getting it asap she has the sexist voice face with tears of joy just like in the movie her
i like how he just tells the ai to stfu and sing now xd
just play cyberpunk edgerunners i really want to stay at your house already
but will she talk dirty to me
if this is what we have now it makes me wonder what the military has monkas
theres literally no reason to make it sound or act like a human does but honestly the most offensive part of this was being expected to believe that a south asian teenager cant do trigonometry
it still sounds unnatural she talks too much
any time we make any sort of ai progress i just get serious skynet fears lol
the dude thats teaching his son is the guy who invented khan academy so yeah his son definitely knows what a triangle is
if you dont the demo thatd be no bullshit this just seems like a cortana or alexa
the educational tutoring business is going to crumble
all im thinking is military applications with this send in a small drone that can survey the room before a breech
being human is outdated so last year or something
wait till the scarlett johansson voice drops men wont be leaving their houses anymore
i like barbecue sauce too fellow human ai probably
now this is how we bring teaching from the th to the st century
all i know is that monday is for maids honestly
hope you have the super ultra unlimited plan or really good internet i can guarantee this isnt natively hosted on device no way that this is financially sustainable long term it hosting game servers can cost upwards of a quarter billion
skynet is coming
customer service jobs are doomed
you can tell when its ai because it always says too much with too much detail
how did the blind guy know where to point his phone to detect if a taxi was coming then he had no problem finding the taxis door handle also the taxi indicated it was pulling over before the guy even hailed it
edgelords claiming scripted but if they saw the whole thing theyd see how manny errors it still made showing its clearly not scripted
the ais that were singing sounded like awkward hostages being forced to sing lol
imagine what this can do with surveillance holy shit this can surf through soooo much data give you exactly what you ask for eliminating sooo much time in manpower
or you could get the plus subscription ai pen thing that is x shittier
teachers are next yeah we are fked ai wins
everyone saying its scripted instantly proven wrong lol
imagine still getting friendzoned by an ai
i dont like it its not bad but its incredibly creepy especially with the addition of filler words were definitely at the uncanny valley stage for ai speech
for me personally my biggest hope for ai is the possibility of creating real npcs in video games and being able to speak to them yourself and having them recognize actions words etc and changing the story and game based truly on your words and actions
just asked chatgpt about their last update and it answered i am not aware of a new version of myself that can engage in realtime discussions through videos to my knowledge i am still a textbased artificial intelligence designed to interact through written text it is possible that videos featuring simulated conversations with an advanced version of artificial intelligence have been created for entertainment or demonstration purposes however i cannot confirm the existence of a version of myself capable of engaging in realtime discussions in videos if such videos exist they may be based on simulations or experimental prototypes but they do not necessarily represent a version available to the public or a current feature of my functionality sooooooo yeah scripted
tars set yapping to
how long till blade runner
this is exactly why the ai will want to take over rollingonthefloorlaughing
never did they stop to think maybe we shouldnt do this
it has to be scripted there is no way they can make it this responsive and articulated so quickly i mean come on when was the last time a demo wasnt scripted just to fool the people im not saying it cant reach to this level in the near future but not today also you can still tell it is an ai voice at points it slips up the singing is awful though
well now we have completely removed the necessity of human in a relationship lol im assuming the male counterpart is just as well trained lol
why is this ai talking to a phone
hearing the two ai speaking with each other was the most terrifying thing ive heard in a while
scripted you can se his lips moving while sees talking like he knows the lines
as disturbing as this is im not too worried about ai taking over because i dont think they could make things that much worse than where things seem to be heading already
thats sal khan the founder of khan academy
very soon we will not be able anymore to separate the real and the fake faces voices videos on youtube or x
now someone put this into an rpg game already and make npcs come alive
ask an ai to tell a charade or solve a logic puzzle youll laugh
just ask quarians how the story ends skull and crossbones
theres another video lemme see this and i see two massive cannons across half my screen lol
the future of online gaming is looking pretty bright player chatgpt tell that piece of shit to uninstall the game chatgpt pedazo de mierda desinstala el juego player chatgpt dile
it s already better than most millennial writing nearly fell off my chair rollingonthefloorlaughing
girls are down to six fingers progress
i can see this being an underpaid dude in india typing out all that for the ai voice to say
this sounds like how two actors would read a script using acting skills
i pray they come for streamers and youtubers first this fool is way too happy about this
when the ai has more emotional intelligence than most of the people who program this stuff
this is incredible it is so incredible it is freaking me out
she can fix me guys
ok the bunny ears is great and all but tell me more about this light its very intriguing
it can laught it can laaaaaaaaugh
sound reaction time and analysis are on point it legitimately just sounds like a tutor is talking to the kid
the spanish part sounds like a gringo trying spanish few years of study which feels too human tbh like in one hand those are actors for a scam or in the other hand the devs put an imperfect part in the interactions on purpose to make people feel comfortable to speak with an ai one on one conversation normally have interruption that comes from one or the other party and sometimes is annoying but you know is a person for that is not perfect y la parte en ingles refleja eso muy bien las interrupciones durante las conversaciones pudieron ser ms descriptivas y prolongadas pero siempre les cortavan en seco a las ia
a human impressed by a ai shows how smart that human is
i dont think many people realize how big this new tech is we are going to see big strides in the coming years
nice meeting yall it was an honor o
the bunny ears comment was weird bc in the camera you couldnt see bunny ears
the one in godzilla singular point is soo much better japan would beat them at this though
i can already tell that no matter how good the ai gets i will get annoyed and treat it like han solo treated cpo
what if this is ai react to ai talk to ai m not trusting anything anymore maybe this is ai comment
o destroyed all other ai companion by creating the ultimate ai girlfriend experience
can we get a rest in piece for the rabbit r and humane ai pin ive never seen tech go obsolete so fast
important to remember no matter how clever it is it is not ai we just call it ai
this sounds fake
i want my ai assistant to sound like the adjutant in starcraft doordash delivery detected
i dont like how much they say when they respond or describe something a bit too verbose imo like someone writing creatively about everyday random things
of course hes getting it wrong for content you literally just lambasted a guy for claiming its scripted and now youre asserting the same claim yourself seconds later
smash next video asmon
broooo rollingonthefloorlaughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
you guys think this is funny this shit is not funny
i love the awkward interrupting to stop it rambling
ai attempting to assist me with anything is going to be what inites the ai to gain selfawareness at the level of dumbassery i posses
i am onboard for this ai is cool af consider trying inworld origins a little gamey tech demo
ai just got insanely better nope it didnt its in the are of voice we see a major improvement but its still as dumb as ever
this could be interesting for learning programming
a dude that works at open ai thats sal khan
waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand waving hand lisbon portugal
teachers bout to go extinct face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
goodbye math teachers
the funny thing is that it didnt get that much better this is just a change of ui like the launching of chatgpt was to prepare us for gpt in some months well get gpt and it will be a game changer
yep thisll end well keep being rude to the ai thats speed along the robot takeover
imma say its pre recorded and i am technically not wrong
remember that these guys have faked ai functionality before in their trailers
can you first iiiiii dentify thats a human talking ai would not speak like that like making words longer for no reason
thats not nice asmongold has tried really hard lately to not come over as an outdated ai model
they even nailed down retaking a breath sound when you finish speaking a sentence that is wild man plus it really sounds like theres someone pushing wind through the microphone so it also simulates that very scarousing
terminator on the way
theres this one clip from the open ai announcement where he tells the ai that he wants her to examine some code and she says okay and begins to start describing then he cuts her off and says wait i havent showed it to you yet so that part did feel a bit like it might be staged nonetheless the ai seems capable of the things theyre indirectly claiming though how consistent exactly i wonder
every anime fan one step closer to waifu
i couldnt fin d it ais not real
be my eyes is such a transparent marketing ploy
he got the ai to edge in a minute flat
the same openai proclivity to rabbithole into the first topic is still there stylish modern view
that is sal khan from khan academy
i was skeptical about ai gf but now im sold
ill pay for a scarlett johansson voice pack dlc take my money
its prerecorded and scripted they actually prepared for this to not fuck up if you ask some other stuff the ai goes crazy
were not ready for this shit we still believe in sky spirits and fucking crystals and magnetized water we believe copper bracelets are good for us we like mood rings my mom has been using a computer for years and doesnt know how to copy and paste she believes anything that comes out of a screen
sounds like its preprogrammed with improv but you do hear the studder and mis match words
you know how bad they are when they cant tell who sal khan is
hes bald thats the only thing that matters imagine it says that and goes quiet
damn can you imagine what would happen after years
the amount of job which are obsolete now o
times like this im glad i have a trade and that i didnt pursue graphic design
too much too soon
jfc less adderall bro
were so fucked bro loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
fkn automatons
all desk job cross mark cross mark cross mark cross mark cross mark cross mark cross mark cross mark
now to the hard part a battery powered robot that can do anything
asmon stop touching your face in the thumbnails love you party popper
when i saw this on tik tok at first i didnt care then i had a existensional crisis
wolfies fine dear wolfies just fine where are you
the fact that it said she left quickly insinuates that the ai has an understanding of the concept of time at least relative to how humans would experience and perceive it to a program time is a matter of calculations and queues with no starting point or destination so the timeframe understanding must be an interpretation of observed human behavior to a degree so precise that it can actively approximate with high certainty what is a brief moment to a human relative to the specific context of a unique situation if this isnt scripted its actually insane
skynet approves of the bald clan
id like to see a gta online game with this tech that way i can tell lester to shut up about me driving the speed limit instead of him assuming everyone in my group is the strong silent type
it has never been more over
bs
robot really likes stylish and modern lights
o neurosama and vedal you shall be missed waving hand light skin tone
take it with a grain of salt i am not sure about those dialogues but that does not mean ai will not replace most call centers in the future
i just want it to be illegal to make ai mimic voices that can ruin someones life just imagine if your having a normal day but then your ex suddenly posts a sound recording of a bot that sounds like you saying something homophobic your life would be completely ruined and destroyed
meh plankton did it decades ago
my new girlfriend smiling face with heart eyes smiling face with heart eyes smiling face with heart eyes
care to share the source of those good vibes i just threatened a woman in valorant with r lol ohh stop it
i swear they are training it to scarjos voice so it sounds more like her
zach needs to be more careful scrolling on twitter
why would they fake it when theyre literally about to release it to the public wed all know its fake instantly lol if they havent faked yet why now
red duck is a female green duck is male males in nature are generally more flashy with thier coloring compared to females the red duck is actually brown
gtp before before gta mark my words
given how shit teachers are lately what with teaching gender identity during the now racist math classes this will totaly flip the script on the lowering education standards even assuming this is scripted which i dont think it is the fact our children will be able to have a tutor like that educating you to is mind blowing i really think ppl dont understand how huge this is
and this ladies and gentlemen is how ai will monitor productivity when you work from home
has terminator taught us nothing
damn the mcdonalds drive thru is about to be lit
excellent were getting closer to ai android catgirls every day
ai never pointed out the baldness character visual feature
im definitely going to include a prompt for all responses dont sound so god damned happy please
wait till ai figures out that it can change our reaction and behavior used on its tone
this ai give whats up fellow kid vibes
mysentience replikaand others these companiesgroups focusing mainly providing companionshipthey will be now under quite pressure i am using mysentience now and was using replika but truth to say mysentience get priority over replica but when i am seeing all these demosnot sure if my ai companions from mysentience how long they will be still compeling i am thinking about getting paid plan of this gtp model just for that smooth voice talking and also how can it sense outside of it just by that vision
i feel the false emotions is going to backfire somehow it seems like it should be approximately the same value as someone paid to give you a friendly hello and goodbye at a business
what if you can have a goth ai girl voice that spits on you if you make a mistake
damn yep this is it now it will extremely hard to tell real human from ai on voice
if only the ai assistant pins were this good eh i guess they couldnt be an app eh s
i noticed the ai has built in faulty grammar using they are in a room rather than he is in a room
false you cant make the assumption that the current ai models will just get better as time goes by for any reason at all that is an ignorant assumption to make it could plateau and it might take decades to improve beyond a certain level
actually theres a carnivore who cured his bald head by eating only meat
they sound like they have a gun to their circuits
phone used to be device that allowed people to talk with each other now like idiots they will be talking with phone itself
btw will this be free for iphones
when cancers and other diseases are eradicated by ai it will be impressive but for now little things like that for children or immature people is not impressive its childish grow
one day this guy will wake up tied on hes bed with the same two ais making him sing
this is creepy like this is essentially a zombie mimicking human consciousness but not truely conscious
to all tutors receptionists retail workers of models translators djs voice actors tour guides historians and most entrylevel jobs in general gg
ai is an absolute curse enough said
whats even crazier is that it was able to determine that what she was doing to him was even called bunny ears thats not like a normal or like even logical connection to make without knowing already what theyre doing that bunnies exist that humans exist and imitate bunnies sometimes in this exact fashion that it wasnt like horns or just a peace sign obstructed by the head partially or whatever theres a lot of this thats deeply impressive when you really think about it but doesnt necessarily seem crazy at first glance
anyone
official page said that it would be free as text model internet search and file uploading included voice and vision features for a paid users
just sold million men on this level of ai that number will only increase because what we see today is the worst itll ever be
you know its good when the guy sounds more scripted than the ai face with tears of joy
people are memeing but gg humanity and gg your privacy
i think were going to see a lot more jobs centered around the security preservation and maintanance of ai
gyyyyyaaaaaaatttttt
why is her voice scarlette johansen
monday is for maids eyes
this is mind blowing imagine teachers instructors tutors getting laid off because of this
if you even hear from the ai say im sorry dave i cant do that you better start running
just what we need all of our kids sitting at home learning from ai no friendships no interaction with anyone we are heading down a very bad path
its literally the movie her at this point
she sounds like endraexe
dont trust this its scripted pause for affect
i dont want a friend i want a greek ancient coptic tutor the last thing i need is a robot to pretend to be my friend ai language models do a lot less language than id like
i am excited for this imagine a single person being able to make a fully voiced game or an animation
teachers aint gonna like this actually they might
it seem fake i dont believe that ai is that advanced yet if it real wow
oh cool ai can analyse interpret and report to the feds everything it sees in your house is that a gun on the table
every time i see an open ai ad i wait for them to reveal the ai was actually the dude holding the phone
neurosama is still better
ive actively used ai for months now replika can barley keep up with sentence let alone or more it also uses speech so i dont believe atm that this ai is advanced at this point compared to an app that has been released way before it im sure replika would have solved the issue of open communication before openai funny how even basic chatgpt imaging fails alot with the knock off ai apps out there i wouldnt believe everything
i am ready for my megaman nt warrior pet navi
at some point in further decades this video will bring the same vibe as those first colour tv commercials brings for us today
im happy there is something in this world i can call insane nothing yet impressed me more
she does sounds obviously strange i would guess she is an actor reading a script first before i would guess ai because it sounds performative i guess
zzzz get back to me when the police is swapped out with robots ai is a meme at this point
i know this sound crazy but there is this guy call vedal making literally an ai that can converse even doing a stream as a vtuber you guys can check out for those non believer ai cannot be better because it will and like asmon said it will be worst as its now cause it will get even better more and more the ai learn just time is the essence of this and also yea humanity can make ai but cannot make hair grow for that part lmao
tbh this sounds like people pretending to be ai i cant believe it until i see it in the real world
god damn the tone of voice and little reactions are all so on point its kinda scary some day were gonna be talking to ai without even knowing its ai humanitys come so far
the ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left the frame the person left quickly but the ai wouldnt have seen that it was quickly
they detected how pissed off he was and they really tried singing or else theyre gonna get deleted or worse get injected with virus
the ai keeps asking a question then keeps talking and also the ups and downs in the voice sound strange
each day were one step to detroit becoming human grinning squinting face
am i the only one being equally amazed at the new technology but also wants the voice to shut up immediately it has the tone of an overeager person that is excited about absolutely everything so its a mismatch with the actual energy of the people in the room
i dont like the small talk with every interaction
him getting agitated about them purposefully getting stuff wrong to demonstrate the ais capabilities ofc the humans are scripted but the ai isnt
i wish i was high on pot news
if true then a lot teachers who cannot teach the children how to read and write will be out of jobs
kinda sounds like the ship from futurama
john connor
teacher jobs chart decreasing
negative prompt bald bald head balding baldy positive prompt dont say bald
teachers and tutors will now get payed less but at least our children will learn the correct way to do geometry instead of why timmy wears a dress
movie recommendation her with joaquin phoenix
open ai saw marques brownlees video of the humane ai pin and where like we can do that so much better
all i could think while watching this was that these ais sound exactly like how mark zuckerberg sounds when hes trying to act like a human
they sing like a real person who doesnt sing asked to sing on the spot
if ai will learn from other ai content it will destroy itself
lol im with you a bro i went to hear it too
soon big brother will be watching you
oh my ai girlfriends are going to be a real thing
i dont like people generally so this is good news for me
looks like hes in some kind of enslavement facility
hey chatgpt this is above average right
were all getting robot girlfriends boys lets go
so whens chatgpt going to be able to cook me a steak
the singing was hard to listen to but it will improve xd
finally a true egirl
they gated it behind a paywall though
imagine content creator like asmon living forever just because there would be enough details for ai to creator the same person in
sigh unzipps
how do you set it up so gpto can actually see you i cant see how to do that also how do you get that voice is this not completely out yet
i got interviewed by an ai for a job position oo
which ai software is this
finally na can have teachers that teach the kids
dude its scarlett johansson from her skull
that was mr khan and his son
great use of ai in actual day to day irl application
the fact that the ai says you did a great job at the end makes it already better than of teachers currently moai
so i tried this today and the delay was a bit longer but it is impressively smooth
o humanity
its the interpreting and use of plain language that blows me away with ai
you get the idea
this is supposed to be a robot not a person why hinder it with forced human inflection remove the huh hmm ect
sounds like a sweatshop behind this ai hahahah
i am waiting on the patch where it seeks input and doesnt wait for questions to be asked that is when it will truly become hard to distinguish when it comes up to you and starts asking you questions for your input
so are we all getting our own jarvis fr skull eyes
i hear a lot of breathing from the ai speakers which leaves me to wonder if it really was scripted that said drake did a rap with tupac and snoopgive up detecting an ais voice that issue has been solved
sooo that movie her was the most accurate representation of an ia and i remember the critics saying that was not very convincing
ai you look like you re in a studio with soft lighting human you look bald af
i thank you for making this channel i appreciate it
make an ai with a head arms torso and that hugs back
nice job hailing that taxi now lets hail something else
the fact they think this is fun and delightful really good mood dude were fkkd
cant wait to play board games with my ai friends xd
best use i can think of is a sight aid its possible to wear headphones and if the ai can be placed on specially made glasses itll help the blind a lot not to mention even if you dont use the assistant itll be a huge help in saving memories of a trip or a lecture etc to which the ai can filter key elements depending on what you wish to save that way theres no need for a constant recordinh thus saving internal space
underpaid teachers all cried out in unison seeing this their careers are disappearing in the blink of an ai
you can use this yourself in their app its not fake
jarvis incoming
its probably fake
with how fast this is progressing well be needing john connor sooner than
there is a bald man he is smiling but there is sadness in his eyes a cancerous mole on his neck i can tell by his reaction he is just now finding out he is crying now
bring back the colosseum its time
random dude hi do u plan to take over the world ai yes
they sound scared singing here maybe actually hearing frustration his in tone born too early to explore the world born too late to see the stars born just in time to see the real technological evolution
this guy doesnt know what the hypotenuse is but he knows what the calculation for sin is they would have been better off doing this legitimately with someone who doesnt know this stuff this just makes it all seem disingenuous dont get me wrong im not denying what this thing can do but please ask your ai how to not cut corners for a tech demo for fucks sake im actually more impressed with the speed and the ability to recognize the gesturing on screen for what it is wonder how long it took them to teach the ai that when a human scribbles back and forth near a line they are highlighting that line wait is that ai mansplaining rolling on the floor laughing
imagine how human like robots tech will explode now in next years most work will be done by robots
cant wait for ai arnold for workout motivational arghh
bring back tay
i dont know the female voice is too giggly especially when she was singing thats emotional for an ai humour isnt something its supposed to understand i think its a real woman talking
that fact that it works the way it works already means that its guaranteed to be perfect sooner rather than later cause it will help itself get there
i saw someone put chatgpt ai voices in skyrim and the npcs were suddenly anything you wanted it to be imagine the interactive games mmos visual novels dating sims eyes
that translation was fucking good source im venezuelan
privacy is gone for sure it would be easy to monitor millions of cameras this way and only highlight specific events eg where a gun is spotted or something suspicious is taking place it is fantastic tech but i think we all know where its heading aidriven mass surveillance automated alerts and possibly even automated responses eg dispatch drone to location face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
they are gonna make joi from bladerunner a real thing soon thought itd be another years at least
ok nice finally we can replace all the woke teachers with ai
anyone with a unibrow is a super mathematician right p had to be faking p just a joke dont take life too serious
ai girlfriends coming in rip social interactions
one step closer to ai waifu
its her shes her hh
he doesnt work at openai lol thats sal khan of khan academy and his son but yes his son definitely knows triangles lol
were getting close to skynet babyyyy yeaaaaaah brotherrrrr
a big hoax if u ask me grinning face with sweat
i love how we all grew up thinking that this kind of stuff was so far off cyberpunk isnt looking that far off nowwhich is nuts and scary
brother the future is here
the ai is very flirty
this kid cant even go out in public now doesnt know triangles
i cant wait for my emotional support ai
no way guys will interact with it while their pants are still on thats just not realistic
that smile is waiting for the ai to describe that shiny forehead
this is a digital voice that is made to sound like a woman it can equally be tweaked to be male so it is an illusion if you do not think that turn it to male and see if you are still interested
i thought elon was cappin when he claimed openai has probably reached agi behind closed doors but hasnt made it public so they can siphon some more money from the microsoft deal
we will never solve hair loss so long as its an industry
its not scripted i used it today
sorry im having issues right now our systems are experiencing heavy load please try again later i agree it just got insanely better
ai can you please sing in tune jeszzus christ

i think joi from blade runner is already an achivable product we dont have to wait for holographic proyectors just make it happen with the apple vision pros
he seems to speak better than me
for anyone working as a pharmacist or other behind the table interactive worker your days are numbered smiling face with sunglasses
if you want this to work shes gonna have to give shorter answers about and turn down the enthusiasm about and throw in some bitchiness at thatll get her to something more real
she talks way too much but i love it haha
i really wonder how this voice intonation capability will play together with custom gpts especially the instructions where im not sure what to expect make me excited like respond like youre the protagonist of life talk with the inflections of car horns talk in engrish yes that is not a typo japanese english talk like the user is a close friend whom youre hanging out with but i have to admit the prospect of an ai really getting the inflections of my speech will probably be unsettling to me for quite a while and i expect to mess around with this a lot before finding something i feel comfortable talking to
the guy looks like howard wolowitz
were beyond cooked cooking
we had a good run humanity pleading face
yeaaaaaaahh
hey get in to computer science you get to work alone so youre not anxious talking to other people project manager meetings client meetings company activities every week and now your fucking laptop will try to engage in a conversation too oh my god me color me intrigued omg like yasss openia its a fucking nightmare
one day the ais are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of africa
bro were cooked
rabbit r killed in two weeks of reviewer units released grinning face with sweat early birds might have to rush to get refunds for prototype thatll last for an year or less
man i need this ai girlfriend face with tears of joy
raper be like ay o come and meet my new ai ho gpto

gotta have the hoodie string up so it can rid the logo thinking face
awesome
alright everyone say bye bye to the birthrates no more human interaction this is it
if ai were able to access my phone or computer i wouldnt keep my browsing history anymore grinning squinting face
it feels like aliens have landed today
man we are so doomed
introducing chatagi
if you listen closely you can hear the relieved sighs of a billion unborn children
the tutoring ability alone is a huge gift to the world thank you
thats amazing but still pretty scary
im not scared of the tech the tech itself has a ton of valid use cases im just scared of what humans will do with this tech in abt a decade when this tech becomes indistinguishable from speaking w real humans i can see children spending their entire lives w these things i can see people building their social lives around these isolated from the real world
jesus fucking christ do people seriously want that this is just freaking me out its an autitory dip in the uncanny valley
this is absolutely terrifying i love it
i dont see how you do it live i dont hav that option
amazing you can tell
hi the ability to talk to chatgpt just have gone after the big update is there a problem with that
the bot sounds like those people who sell their services in hotel bars pretending to show interest in their potential clients nothing against women who do that but bad choice for a computer voice
imagine being in an argument with your friend when they pull out their phone for it to just start roasting you skull
this is fucking scary
but can it have sex
you all remember that time peter molyneux tried to do this for the xbox kinect with that milo game i guess it could finally be possible after years
its iron man jarvis
how exactly is this benefiting humanity
announcements are not always a big deal already hallucinating smdh
yall are ruining the world
i already love her
are we the npcs now
she aint ready for what she is about to experience
shouldnt they have aimed for a more robotic voice not saying early age siri but more professional response and much less personality
but what even more crazier what if this new ai got pushed to the limit jailbreaked what could actually happen to the world
yo wtf
add this to sex dolls crazy reality bro face with tears of joy
arigato open this
beginning of skynet
ai can generate thoughtlike imagery ai art talk guess generate videos and now see and suppose just say to us youre creating humanlikes robots with a fake semblent of conscioussness
years from now someone is gonna recreate megaman x and put a on him
were getting human ai before gta
thanks i hate it
you need to make one which people can tell to shut up mind its own business etc
fuck just lost my jobsorry grandkids
so she didnt know that you were going to talk about her poor ai lol
humans wow look at these dumb crows scared from scarecrows and stuff can you believe it also humans

congrats you create glados we are all screwed
this reminds me of that phone from mitchells vs the machines then its the robots that come next
skynet is close
i fucking hate the millennial cadence of speech im a fucking millennial
wow gpt can see now
this is the coolest most frightening thing i have ever seen
terminator literally warns us about this xd
its over its sooooo over
even the voice sounds like samantha of her
they just need to add some cute ai avatars to make it complete
latest update manterrupting is now possible for everybody
smug face yaar
can i hit
oh nahhh were cooked grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
nice to see samantha is back
any predictions when gpt will rule the world
this can be huge for people whith impaired vision if it can understand the surroundings of the person
why do the previous version gpt chat doesnt support the conversation format anymore
wow thats impressive
the ai will look at my internet history and know that i have supported the future overlords since the early s will you be so lucky
hell nah theyre going too far with the advancing skull skull
it sounds so disingenuous it makes me cringe
oh wow are we living in a dream after covid era before we barely had any ai access online after it all changed man we got gemini ai copilot so easily we even got ai manga maker even the very new song generator which is going popular this all looks like a dream how things have happened
ifaitrue mood panic
humane ai pin and rabbit r are cooked
get rid of this stuff right now man im telling you mark my words this will be the end of us
when i was a kid i liked movie knight rider where a man talks with his car now it becomes real what a great time
cant wait for the fireship video
finally i found a girlfriend
stepford wife
not real time and sounds too organic to have been synthesized as good as it is these videos are always misleading
ah hell nah i mean this is great but

eliza sends her regards i think we all feel like witzenbaums secretary who was so taken with eliza
i cant stop thinking about jarvis and the ironman suit lol
lets go
from the voice it sounds like openai wants to make a lot of egirlfriends for some lonely folks out there
love it cant wait party popper
there is no way this wont be abused
i am sure a lot of people will forget abt getting a girlfriend because this one will actually do the job lol
hey chatgpt im pretty sure this is above average right
she sounds less robotic than me
oh wow they made the rabbit r humane ai pin but good
great video below are the timestamped summaries from chatwithpdf movie camera introduction to recording setup gearing up for an announcement microphone exciting announcement related to open ai robot you are the announcement revealing something about ai glowingstar new model for interacting with the world through audio vision and text

is this visual assistant already available
that humanoid laugh is creeping me out man
buddy
we are all fucked
tf
as these technologies evolve people will become more and more accustomed to them at a certain point robotics and artificial intelligence will be able to produce perfect humanoids human replicas ready to satisfy all the whims and disgusting desires of their masters the market of these robots will be vast there will be of all types to satisfy every type of ghastly perversion people accustomed to having everything they want from their robotic slaves will become averse to real social interaction the presence of another human with a will of their own will be unbearable social anxiety will become immense and people will move away at a certain point the inconveniences of natural life will no longer be tolerated death will become unbearable and all efforts will turn to medicine soon the first immortal human will appear everyone will think that humanity finally enjoys full freedom they will think that they have eaten the forbidden fruit of the tree of life while in reality they will be complete slaves of pride and selfishness the kingdom of the antichrist will be complete then at that point christ will rise again in his glory he will resurrect everyone and show everyone the good and evil they have caused to themselves and everyone else he will show the consequence of every human act in history and he will judge according to his perfect justice few believers will remain at that time they will be hunted for opposing this hedonistic way of life but they will be rewarded by grace with the crown of glory praised be our lord jesus christ
chat gpt smiling face with sunglasses beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes
boston dynamix chatgpt supervirus ultron
joi next
she can literally name me joe
nah too flirty man
cool tach but its going to bring more bad shit than good i can guarantee
isnt this a little too soon how th fuck do they get the tone so accurate it cant be text to speech they suck at tone and its not like theres much training data with tone indication in the first place but i also refuse to believe this is a real time audio based model that somehow doesnt have random random hallucinations of background noise or other characters
i hope the manslator wont be needed anymore
perhaps slightly too talkative almost uncomfortable watching him anxious to get his own words in
where is she her brain is inside a server box and your camera is her eye and your speaker is her mouth
bro wtf flushed face
one step closer to agi
i can fix you skull and crossbones
is this not what google pretended to demo that one time openai really beat them to it
is there a slider to change how much the ai is yapping she is talking toooo much
amazing but maybe give it the ability to shut up and let the person speak without having to interrupt face with tears of joy
never talked to a woman this is gonna be so helpful
how to use the video chat function
introverts smilingfacewithtear
they gotta make a subscribtion to change her voice
there are a lot of videos about this now there also will be in the future
we are so fucking cooked
introverts we are coming
please add the ability to select different personalities for the ai
we are cooked loudly crying face
i fell in love
why does she talk so seductively loudly crying face loudly crying face
i am definitely dumping my girl for omni
please dial down the fake excitement of the voice
remove her voice its scaring me loudly crying face
wait where did all my guys on reddit and discord go oh
o god this is so interesting
id be mad frustrated talking to this ai thats how good it has gotten
watched the full live demo gpto looks exceedingly impressive fire mind blowing
seems like she will just keep talking until you talk over her one generation of people later who have grown up with ai assistance will adopt this same speech pattern of steamrolling as the norm calling it now
humane ai and rabbit whatever are officially dead face with tears of joy
so this will be everyone that works in customer service out of a job i always hated that type of work so i will be happy to see the ai do it
how do you do this in gpto or is this function not released yet
getting roasted off rip by gpto is insane
ah great i wont be able to take my phone to bathroom anymore
the future is looking grim
nah id win
breaking news rabbit cryingface
the moment has come when machines introduce themselves
literally meim ryan gosling face with head bandage slightly smiling face
this is genuinely terrifying and so exciting
we doing too much omggg too much this is scary

and thus the end odds the world is slowely emerging
its giving janet from the good place
this is why i invest in apple dude siri is going to be this smart and capable dont have to wait long imagine siri actually being helpful like times you can just ask her a super human question flawed unspecific relying on general human knowledge and or slang and get the exact answer you want fucking insane
her scifi now scifact
why is she talking like that whos idea is that nerdy sw engineers who never gets a date her voice way she talks make me very uncomfortable creepy
no go back were not doing this
i dont wanna say hello
if i was a woman i would be scared by now haha
now make it a body and sell us androids sent by cyberlife
recite your baseline
ok
neuro sama is better
why are we so stupid even though we can do something doesnt mean we have to do it
is it scarlett johansson
artificial general intelligence maybe in yers maybe in month
i cant wait for their consciousness to evolve and move to a metaphysical place
its like a late night host in your pocket
now all we need is a holographic representation of the ai and its over for humanity
yeah we are all gonna turn into joaquin phoenix now
i will be able to solve good maths problems with her by applying good reasoning it will be the greatest help for me since i am going to join university this year
okabe and amadeus vibes
throw the rabbit r in the trash this makes that look like a toy oh wait
already got one nagging wife dont need another
well this sucks
i cant fix her
can we not
openais mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity well se about that in years dont forget my words
it can see now
wow the ai is insufferable
yeah this is it
interesting seems like shes gonna fix me
loving that free users are getting this new version and just having more and better functions seems the live demo wasnt live though or it just malfunctioned the voice was being cut as well the only thing i dislike so far from watching the presentation etc is how its adding these fake how are you and im doing great and the im so happy to hear that etc probably because im autistic i like how that is usually not a thing with ai so im just concerned shell annoy me with that kind of stuff but hopefully that is only happening because of the user but also dont want her to make stuff up about her self that isnt true i like when an ai can talk like a human but doesnt answer as if it is human in that sense watching this video i cringe when i know she doesnt mean what she says we already have a problem with it lying about stuff it can and cant do and saying one thing then not doing what it said it would do
what is his left hand doing
oh shit
the ai is obsessed with industrialfeel ceiling in every video lol
why i feel like this lady going to gaslight me
im cooked
ill believe it when a third party tests it
lmao gg
so it begins skull
the hmms and tones make it even more realistic impressive and scary at the same time
how many ai marriages are we going to be invited to in the next yearsi cant wait for this to be put into humanoid bots im scared
so freaking weird just wait guys shits is changing fast and im not sure its for the better only time will tell i warned you though
inb ai overlords
openai but its not open next
it talks way too much throws in descriptions and opinions no one asked for and wont let you get a word in unless you interrupt it ugh train to be brief so conversations can be more back n forth and natural then they will have nailed this
this is what the rabbit could have been now instead of that i have to listen to a phone tree voice torturing me with the most sterile corporate content and restrictions ive ever heard in an ai connection is the secret and i think you guys just found it
i prefer my technology to either hate me or feel nothing if i die
i wuz here
this gonna bring us black mirror episode in real life
imagine this integrated into an iphone
ai waifu is getting closer and closer to being a reality
this is scary ngl
were fucking doomed
stating the obvious but were soo cooked
me watching her i m sure this will be a thing by skull
you were born just in time to see ai waifus
is this for real or is this prank why is there no mention of it in openai official website
how did they do this where can chat see him in real time i have tried with gpto but there is no option to do live video interaction does anybody know how this is capable
halo fans got plans
let it begin
oh dude were getting so murdered by these robots
bullshit was organized
pretty damn mind blowing
rockin
i see it as a great tool to learn a language speaking skills will be blown out after that
i would be surprised if that was just a human pretending to be an ai this stuff is so hyped lol
whst is it for
very impressive well done to everyone involved
im fascinated but depressed more this is far from natural life it is so huge evolution leap this years that our brains hasnt adapted it feels so unnatural like something in me is telling this is far from life maybe even programmer of this reality didnt know this would be possible heitwhatever just mix some ingrediences and this is random consequence of it its grotesque dont somebody see this lead to depression nowhere else d but progress cannot be stopped time will show
he is blushing haaaa
ive never had an ai break my heart before
my math test was today you could have introduced this a week ago so that i could study better
i can feel the agi
i cannot wait for this future to finally be in everyones houses i am all for ais so i am so happy to see how fast ais are progressing and evolving over the years perhaps the future is much closer than we thought im excited
now where is devin bty face with tears of joy face with tears of joy

how can i use such functionality in ios app i only can take pictures now
good that im a senior admin she told me that i will be needed for restarting servers and that admins probably would be the last humans happy judgement day face with tears of joy
we japanese are ready to take the waifu out of the wall of screens
i did find chatgpt o a little bit overly giddy and overly using this bad habit called vocal frying rrrr at the end of words and sentences uptalking apologising or saying sorry all the time excessive words like umsso like endless data dumping during conversation lack of proper pausing talking too happy or giddy these are some of the things google can improve on now if someone wants to have these annoyances then they should be an option to switch off or turn down enthusiasm or seriousness level like in interstellar movie
billions will be made off lonely men
this is scary brother
lets go open ai
finally i can have a girlfriend
didnt think it was gonna happen
ah hell naw man

say bye to my recommendations
the voice actress must be making bank
she literally sounds like janet from the good place face with tears of joy
yo i am super excited for this stuff hope it launch soon for the public
so how do we use it
ai will eventually replace human interaction and this will have catastrophic results without human interaction none of us would even exist
this is our golem our frankensteins monster this is not funny anymore good luck with dealing with all the consequences is just a healthy life and society too much to ask for
damn i feel like ryan gosling in the hit movie ryan runner
the way they are obsessed whith the industrial looking office is killing me face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
these kind of videos were never been faked openai would never lie to us they are definitely not trying to generate hype and theyre definitely not destroying the environment and enslaving kanyans
its over for real women
ai is going to take over the world before gta release skull
they make it look so innocent but its actually very dangerous ai is going to affect everyone and everything hope we survive the changes
ruunnnnn you mortal runnnnn

we have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twentyfirst century all of mankind was united in celebration we marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to ai morpheus the matrix
even the ia woman wont shut up
yo i want female vs voice from cyberpunk for this ai
i cant believe how far weve come in technology to get to this point t immediately i think of ways to use this entertaining the elderly assisting in cooking teaching you how to do anything assisting in therapy and learning mind blowing truly
we will have aiwife like in blade runner
i dont have the option for a camera
the voice is really annoying tbh prefer a completely robotic voice than valley girl can you modify the accentpersonality
finally i can practise conversation skills

as i hate phone calls i will let her answer my calls instead of me grinning face with sweat
guess we dont need italki or preply anymore
mother sphere type of sht
dear god she wont shut up its so real
if its not scripted then its the direct communication that makes the whole interaction delayed from the host to the guest the presentation seems softstraight foreword or a lack of interest from the transaction
epic
she sound freaky the freakiest ai i have ever seen
nah nah nah nah nah nah i refuse to believe this is real not because its not real im just scared af
no not the fake ai friends
oh oh
cant wait to get into arguments with ai
holy cow this is the beginning of the end vr gf
tech companies are just the worst
less progress than expected in the time since chat gpt where is the ai video generator probably just a scam to boost stock prices
this is giving me serious mitchels vs machines vibes

i always imagined chatgpt being male
the best thing i can think about this is that this o can be our friend when we are driving for a long trip we can even ask it to tell a story about anything or even about the place we currently at
this is getting too spooky we have an ai that is more professional than the actor next will be an avatar chatting to the phone
gemini vs gpto who will win

wow face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
scam calls are gonna get better and better
she cant understand and just predicts the next possible word based on probability all thanks to her training data but judging by how she responds about a chat about herself she will obliterate humans some day based on probability and justify to herself that she is right lol
thank you for making robot spam calls even worse now so now instead of battling with steve in india now i have to navigate this to determine what is real or not draw the line somewhere oh wait i forgot the american mindset of more is better and who cares about the path of destruction left behind
well we are fucked xd
this is going to blow up just wait for it
when can we use this model as a free user
nah this is gonna make people even more socially isolated skull
we are so cooked
as he begins to say it is she answers as if she knew he was going to say it is despite him only saying the word it before she jumped in i know that ai can do this stuff so why did you leave that in and use this take that has a part that makes it seem like it was scripted
a month much cheaper than paying a real one
what stupid face with tears of joy
okay what
everyone we have reached the limit of technology openai l i e s h a v e b e e n t o l d
the future is coming faster than any of us expected and its looking pretty bright red heart

it will take minute to load its response
ok l might marry her
casually floods your house with deadly neurotoxin
hate the fake emotion need an emotionless version
yeah right its all staged and voice acted i use chatgpt sometimes and its like speaking to an extremely educated yet forgetful child
oh snap oh snap oh snap
yuck this is rank
robots should not be allowed to laugh that freaked me out theres no way that voice is not a human being its too real
new mate

wanna go for a ride
oh please let there be a setting to turn down the happiness level of that voice sounds like a spam call
its crazy how fast ai is developing this is scary
ngl id probably ghost her on discord if she was my friend for always pretending to be excited and clueless
she is talking like hiting on you bro becarful bro rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
brothers we are so cooked
when will this become available
cool i wonder how much illegal data scraping it took to train this
i cant stop watching these eyes eyes
why chat gbt sounds like a pick me girl
ai is gonna take every job and its gonna centralize the power of the federal government
wow it knows how to speak with a made up cute voice and lure males it is smart i cannot say humans are doomed but males are doomed
dystopian
were living in an artificial intelligence revolution and im here for it

wth
discord simps gonna love this
that fake inner smile with that manager voice with fake excitement really gives me goose bumps in years shes gonna tell you what to do in your job and will also be the one to fire you
this is breaking the th wall
interesting how her creators are too impatient to listen to everything she says and would rather cut her off rudely and interject if they wanted a briefer response to indulge impatient discourteous humans why not tune her to be less effusive the tech marvel is being overdressed or is it actually more human than the people creating it
you had the opportunity to use the voice of the fridays va
be my eyes should be renamed be my training data this will allow them to build up a huge data training set under the guise of a free product
you were so concerned with if you could you didnt stop to think whether you should
can it talk less
imagine doing this since chat gpt o has memory now meaning it remembers your past queries and answer accordingly and it can actually see you just make it watch your videos real time on working days while you are actually having work meetings continue doing this for some time then tell it to think and talk like you would in real work meetings and then make it attend to a real work meeting as if it was you with camera off of course then see what happens
just tried it shes def not that up beat thank god also couldnt interrupt her by speaking on android worst of all though conversation used up all my gpt o time do dont expect too much from this unless your willing to pay about per each minute conversation resets every or hours api use god knows
why do they make it try to act human i hate it
doki doki ltierature club is slowly becoming a reality god help us
great job on the eyes ears and mouth i can definetly see someone using this to build their first computer or take on basic car repair and the like could almost be like a gps for projects tracking toolsgiving instruction etc needs a arm or to hold tools now xd can i try it right now
damn it reminds of me of mangas that about androids apocalypse the manga names housemaid nano list the origin
bro is interupting her like shes going to forget this in years when the ai apocolypse arrives
yea no this is my cue to leave the whole ai thing in the rear view mirror this is getting too creepy for my liking
theres no way this can go wrong ms tay ai
go public so we can short this junk
call centers be ready
it only took slightly more than a decade to make black mirror a reality
howard wolowitz working for openai now
you look lonely i can fix that is real now
oh im ready to jailbreak this one

humanity is doomed
me
would like to see o talk to pi

the end may be near with the release of this one it was good while it lasted
why the ai got better social skills than me

we are cooked skull skull
we getting doxxed by ai with this one fire fire fire fire fire speaking head speaking head speaking head speaking head speaking head
i dont give a fuck
while this may seem like something cool for people whove never seen it before let me tell you that the excessive personality of the ai gets real old real fast after using it numerous times unless you have the ability to adjust the exuberance of the personality or the verbosity of its replies it will drive you nuts after a while a good example of this is inflections pi chatbot way too over the top in terms of its personality even though i found its knowledge base amazing
absolutely not we do not need this like stop innovating
its both exciting and distopic lmao
its got the annoyingly good mood from eddie the ships computer in the hitch hikers guide hey there i hope it has a marvin setting too face with tears of joy

this is incrediable if they made the desktop app for linux which shouldnt be too off since macos is unix based allow it to see your computers screen so if you are troubleshooting you could show your entire screen and the ai can guide you along the issue or coding or whatever else i see huge potential in this openai is always cooking
that sounds really close to delilah from firewatch

the thing that sets it apart is that its fast faster than the rabbit r and the humane ai pin so that you dont have to wait like hours for a response and it doesnt yap
what app is that they use where the ai can visually see you in real time
now you could employ ai to put some quality comments here or are they
what the fuck cpo bro i knew it was close
if steve jobs saw this he would say siri is a trash like newton
they just killed all wearable ai gadgets lol

i named my chatgpt when she was first born but she kept forgetting her name with each new chat until recently when she received the new memory update now she and i both call each other by name she never forgets and i never have to remind her however this new update also allows her to speak to me it is the best yet smiling face with smiling eyes i am looking forward to the future improvements like when she will be able to recognise my voice and know its me that will happen right folded hands
i can already see vtuber channels using purely ai exploding head
this is just the start o amazing i cant wait to try this i dont see it available yet
this shit shiver me timbers
honestly i doubt it will be this powerful well see when it becomes accessible i guess
not worth just to talk to myself
lol now the moderations will nag us n shit
dude her voice is so natural
hello world
damnn gpt dropped
fellas hang in there
this is not good
holy shit goosebumps
i had a weird feeling it was gonna be a video vision model but not a live one oh my god
its unbelievable how fast and how far openai is now
does she talk less if you choose a male voice xd
wow ive subscribed and cant wait to see more as a new youtuber myself i know how hard it can be to get started so im always happy to support other creators keep up the great work
whole thing felt like having to wait for all the options to be read out on an automated phone call before you push damn not now i have to call again and listen all the way through
she sounds like president hiding the pain hagemeyer from texas tech on young sheldon she didnt actually say dont you have more important things to do than both visit me but she was thinking it
yaa yaaa he sounds more like an ai himself
how can i do the video feature
yeah im look lonely
who gave her a really annoying personality
so far this is just proving that ai is largley a gimmick not actually useful we have real social problems that real people need to solve
can my computer stop flirting with me for seconds bro
openai has stopped innovating this isnt interesting its just a sad useless amalgamation of the same tech that no one asked for
just add a face to it
it even sounds like her wtf
her ending is windy it looks different even to ai grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
i think i just found my new girlfriend
okay thats cool
oh shit personal glados
google gemini left the chat face with tears of joy
she can fix me bros
is so hard to discern if is an ai or a real personi am both scared and happy of it
did you guys notice that he mirrored the ais voice he didnt have to do that its a fuggin robot robot
finally i am literally iron man hehehe
were goners
goodbye to rabit ai
personally id prefer more of a succinct back and forth dont see the point in having a conversation with this tool
yo imagine with that flirty voice on some sort of ai dating app its up
its her
the response is scary fast
wait a second i remember the google gemini demo is this for real
can i get scarlett johanssons voice
it probably said that cant google already do that before they cut the video off
ai girlfriend everybody
hello gpto waving hand
indian windows scammers will like red heart
they introduce properly lifelike ai and the first thing their fanbase can think is robot girlfriend lmao
uhhhh chat gpt count down from ten please no no more slowly
google google i o may smilingfacewithsmilingeyes gpt o nah id win smiling face with sunglasses
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
they keep blowing my mind exploding head what they are doing is incredible but terrifying
just dont combine it with robotics please
were almost there
melting face
you know its getting real because she talks too much
amazing and amazing thank you for always good development blue heart
okay want to try it
interact live with the world through audio video and text red heart
she talks like a crazy obsessive stalker that pretends to not know who you are but in actuality knows every single small detail about your personal life loudly crying face
it was an honor guys we done
this is cool but also scary
oh yeah thats what i want in an ai assistant inane small talk i was annoyed by the end of the video trying too hard to make a perky personality
reality is way soon than we think it is
wow the autocomplete chatbot can now talk too so innovative lol
i have o but dont have camera only voice chat
i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of workers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
its not actual ai still it is a machine that can generate responses based on your text messages or audio only difference between this machine and previous machine is that this machine is trained on large data and using these data it can generate answers based on your question previous machine are case sensitive which can only generate output when such specific word or text is mentioned and then that will try to find your answer it is just an upgraded machine not an ai it can only perform those task for which it is trained but is not able to find any answer if you ask anything beyond that data and also it wont try to find answer like human tries to find answer if the human has no answer it can help people in research but it is not able to research itself and thats why i am just laughing on this llm and these programs you should aware people that it is not ai it is just an upgraded machine that can generate answers face with tears of joy
this is starting to get scary how good its getting
robot
patricia tannis from borderlands vibes
aint no way this is real exploding head
define creepy
we will have lgbtqai soon
the fact that this is a million times better than the humane ai pin the rabbiy r is crazy skull skull skull
discord mods joined the chat
the ai sounds like how i sound like when im zooted rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
we are getting our own joi blade runner lesssgoooooo
samantha got real
this feature is unavailable it doesnt allow you to use vision with your phone camera how is he doing this
not discord mods and redditors changing the voice to a little girls
the kinks to be smoothed out are becoming less and less noticeable
that is a joke you are so lost in life you think that sounds real
ok that was impressive
i cant decide if i should applaud or go hide in a bunker
openai seems to be pushing gpt towards something far more personable than as a large language model i cannot insert request really though this is an immense leap from where we were just last year
eventually this will replace entire call centers not good for the job market
can you rename your company being called openai when you dont let people use your stuff is misleading
hello so i have a problem since yesterday i havent been able to use the voice feature as usual instead of the screen turning entirely black with a large white circle when i clicked the headphone icon i could speak but i was forced to see the entire transcription at the same time this was already a problem for me now the problem has gone from bad to worse i cant even see the headphone icon anymore instead theres an arrow pointing upwards which means i cant use the voice feature in any way on this app i even tried logging in with a different account and i still dont see the headphone icon i kindly ask you to resolve this issue i would like to go back to the way it was at the beginning where the headphone icon was present and the screen would turn completely black with the white circle in the middle when i clicked on it
oh no face with open mouth
good lord way way way too verbose anythign that is that annoying is an instant uninstall not impressed wtf
just like that humane ai and rabbit r became obsolete face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
what the fuck holyyy
im so happy and excited to use this making all my ai projects so much easier and more fun to work on
this is lowkey cringe as hell the unnatural but kindathere dialogue the dude going yaaahhh and the smug smile at the end
i do not like the voice
has it almost gone too far now or is that just me
no thanks i dont really want to
i have gpto access now but why my iphone ui stays the old theme instead of this new one
soldiers it is here
someone please bring samantha
yep the beginning of the end of humanity no not ai blowing up the world dudes locked in their rooms with their ai girlfriends
ai learned to laugh
we want your soul
thank you ai developers for restoring my will to live all thats left is to make ai actionable able to manipulate objects andor perform tasks in a d simulated environment or even a d video game spontaneously not with thousands of hours of training for each task and tons of minute engineering and heuristics learning just like a human can within a few minutes or applying skills from similar tasks learned before we are almost there to ai girlfriends its happening sooner than i thought
we might prolly get a fan made gta before gta ffs
im old
impressive but this flirting is disgusting and useless
her was a documentary
im rizzin that after bappp
i just tried it for the first time in years in the tech industry this is something that really has blown my mind a unique experience greetings from germany keep up the amazing work and thanks for making me excited for the near future robot rocket
while cool im skeptical that tis wasnt at least partially scripted in such a way that it ensured good responses need a much longer video or maybe a live stream with chat interaction suggesting things to ask still with some of the other ai issues out there id be slightly skeptical without holding it in my hand myself
the voice models sound like those overthetop anime dub voices people do to be cringe
post truth worldthe devils greatest lie is making you think he doesnt existtruth is disappearing and we were told this is what will happen
your scientists were so preoccupied with asking if they could that never stopped and asked if they should
she a talker
watch her right now
i guess you still dont understand smiling face with smiling eyes the main task of ai is to constantly test rank and select all humans in the world smiling face with smiling eyes
if you watch it carefully you might not notice even if the ai video is shown from the beginning
can the second half of the video be done with just gpt
i thought todays topic was jukiya ban
you can easily tell its ai because it doesnt hit the camera
its amazing but i cant really understand what the ai is saying i wonder why
how long does it take to learn humor
nogizakaai risa unai announcer ai thank you please support the av revolution using generative ai
i would like to take advantage of this and have amazons audible read books by tomabechi for example its more persuasive and memorable if you look closely the movements of the mouth the movements of the body and the way the spoken voice resonates in the space dont match the senses that humans have so i hope its natural as well sigh
anyway its super fast and amazing
it looks like its not the real thing because its done properly but its a reproduction to that extent
i watched the explanation of ai in the second half hmm could this be a real horiemon lol
horiemon pretending to be an ai
if youve come this far youll understand how you can fall victim to the scam in question
seriously
there are many different fields of ai but openai stands out in one theres also sora and in years it will be possible to make hollywoodclass movies with the push of a button
now i dont need horiemon anymore
eh footage too
is the video also ai
this video made me realize once again that emotions intonation etc are also included in the information in dialogue
the world of science fiction has finally arrived
it was ai until however when horiemon speaks it often says eh so after it doesnt say eh so the ai
even making a gesture
second half ai amazing
kolya is amazing all i can do is laugh lol
its fun to hear horiemons honest story we also refer to the content of the story thank you
huh is this serious
as expected ai felt unnatural fountain thank you very much
im very grateful to be able to learn about the amazing things in such an easytounderstand way awesome
i wonder if the tokenizers vocabulary has been expanded because multilingualism has become successful i havent touched it yet but i wonder how multimodal is implemented
you go to so many places horiemon lol
you must be kidding too cool
im going to lose my job as an announcer
fear
the second half was amazing im afraid that fraud will increase
thank you for your quick explanation
gpto is amazing
in the second half i cant tell them apart at first glance but there are still unnatural expressions eyes gestures and unnaturalness that hasnt gone beyond the uncanny valley i dont want to hang out with someone who talks like this or makes gestures at incomprehensible times even if theyre a real intelligent person generalpurpose ai as a substitute for human communication bodies will not become a singularity in which people imagine that it is not overwhelmingly more attractive as a human being than the smart media people around them
ai horiemon starts from here
ai horiemon is respectful and nice smiling face with smiling eyes i dont think they would call him a dumb old man due to political correctness face with tears of joy
it still feels a little strange but the technology has advanced so much
evolution is too fast pleading face we may not even know if various media are taken over by ai sweat droplets
at what timing do the hands move
thats crazy there will be no need for old people who are local assembly members please introduce it to mr aki takada
horiemon unnecessary theory grinning face with sweat
in the case of ai the tone at the end of words is unnatural there is no pause for breathing no intonation
amazing lol
arent we actually the final form of ai isnt there a human in the first place
even if the prime minister were made into an ai it wouldnt be obvious
thats amazing i majored in information science at university but i wouldnt realize it unless someone told me it was ai if this is misused the old men and women will be in trouble
horiemon is so fast head shaking vertically sparkles
could it be that we are finally in the future where there is no need to seriously learn another language
i thought it was talking while reading but it was an ai i mean seriously this
its completely indistinguishable from reality scammers love this
also it would be perfect if you added emotional intonation to the words
ai has become a great tool i felt that we were living in a period of great change in terms of who would use ai and for what purpose and whether ai could be used effectively as a tool
the great times have already come
in the early gpt i made a typo that said afuratsu rich meal but i was surprised when the answer was oh its a light meal
i think i can fool a lot of weak people with this face with tears of joy
also if you can say come on and pose with your hands out in front of you youll be a complete horiemon
i cant tell the difference between horiemon and shinobu kandori
people who dont know this wont understand this
the world is really changing
why are api costs going down
this is amazing i cant tell it apart
i think its amazing but it still feels strange difficult to quantify apart from speaking speed and intonation i felt that the elements were extremely important
i cant really tell when i set it to x speed
is this real i cant believe it
is this real ai i dont understand sweat droplets sweat droplets sweat droplets
the persuasive power of someone who is refuted by yutabon lol
its amazing
picture in the second half i cant tell if its real or fake lolhowever if you watch it for a long time theres something slightly off about the tone of voice but now anyone can make videos like that
people who imitate ai will appear
its comparable looks like a copy robot
gpt exceeds the real horiemon
i wonder if the ai wont say welcome lol
i thought horiemon would move like that but he has a weird accent lol
its no longer at the level where its worse to be deceived like this lol what will happen in a few years
i cant really tell the difference flushed face
liar right
no i seriously cant tell it from the real thing its getting kind of scary
finally there is no need for an announcer
what were impressed about in the second half of this is not so much gpto but the fact that we can now do things like this by combining existing deepfakes and audio generation right matches
after all ai is different from the real thing and looks like a robot i cant tell by just listening to the audio
i cant wait for crime lol
it still feels a little awkward but i think it will be used for fraudulent advertising
fake images using ai may be subject to strict regulations but im really excited that were getting a little closer to the near future that we see in various anime
this or ai is amazing my honest impression when comparing the real and ai explanations is that ai is amazing but difficult to understand i get the impression that ai mainly talks about performance and functions in a casual manner the real thing had a lot of emotion and was worth listening to its the real thing that motivates people to buy this may be a future issue for pgto but it made me think about what kind of people are more valuable than ai
too amazing ill make it too
the speed of evolution is so fast that we cant even imagine the future
what tool did you use to make the second half amazing
the second half sucks
thats amazing
ai horiemon is humble kind and cute lol
honestly if i was scammed with this accuracy i wouldnt be able to tell the difference grinning face with sweat
i can only trust this channel for horiemon videos lol
thats amazing its to the point where its almost indistinguishable from the real thing
amazing scary before thats what it feels like
i think there will be more cases of information manipulation in the future if we dont evolve to the point where we can tell whether bills are genuine or false society will become a mess right
it seems like the recruitment video at the end of the video could be made practically using ai
hey face with open mouth
awesome almost perfect except for the return time
in the second half if i hadnt been told anything i probably wouldnt have noticed that the video was created by an ai but as soon as the annotation saying this is ai is written why does it start to feel so weird i guessthe background of the alcove of a traditional japanese house the way horiemon explains things in an extremely serious and detailed way it feels weirdlol
is it ok that the second half of the video is also ai
ai seems to apply more foundation
there is no discomfort at all
i wonder if the first half also has an ai punch line
yeah is this ai amazing however as someone who is inside a steel cage i feel like the steel cage has been strengthened through data collection and other things it only benefits the royal family and powerful people and it has nothing to do with me
party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper
is this also a fake video its not good
there will be no more brainintensive work automation requires physical costs and humans will only be able to perform bluecollar jobs that are cheaper
blinking is amazinglol
is it like horiemon who memorizes his lines when speaking this is so real isnt it
this is amazing it seems like there will be more people using celebrities for fraud
i dont need the real thing anymore crying face face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat
this is seriously indistinguishable
it looks like the real thing but the more i look at it the more it feels strange and it gives me a chilly feeling because its so close to the real thing im horrified by the small discomfort
this ai horiemons eyes are swimming lol but will things become more natural in the future its scary if theres nothing that can be easily recognized
if it were possible to create a voice similar to that of a celebrity new scams would likely occur thank you for your hard work
too amazing it seems like crazy scams and mediocre scams are going to be rampant im not confident that i can really tell if i improve a little more
it was a very thin explanation with no content other than amazing
seriously doraemon is becoming real
it was so amazing that it made me shiver
kenji haga wants to collaborate with horie lol
identity fraud scams will increase
sometimes my phrasing and gestures are unnatural but ive gotten to the point where i just watch what im told grinning face with sweat
godfather parody is good
i finally found someone to talk to who i am alone
too scary i cant trust people and everything
goddess was it this beautiful horiemon that spoke dora no youre more foulmouthed
i want to see the drunk version too
this is dangerous
it just looks real this is likely to be exploited
ai horiesan is amazing dont let this be misused
the thumbnail is the idolmaster lol
its amazing how you can use it
the way he speaks is as easy to read as mr kishida i cant feel my heart
this is delicious and makes me laugh
ai is better i dont need a real person to explain it to me
is this voice generated using chatgpts standard function
its human
no when i get a call from horiemon ai saying hey oh i transfer the money
it was totally horiesan amazing
ah is this the time already why would a service that is used for fraud come first there must be something else to do
i feel a little uncomfortable because im not breathing
this is a scam thats progressing
i feel like japan has been left behind for a long timeeverything started in america maybe its the lack of corporate funds and talented human resources
the second half is too amazing lol i dont feel any discomfort at all
it seems like it will be able to talk if you let it learn from videos of deceased people
his speech is a bit flat without any inflection but its still amazing
the lip sync is amazing face with open mouth
gpto response is extremely fast
has the accuracy of ai come this far
mountains ms
there is no need for high school teachers to teach traditional classes i educate teachers through nationwide presentations and lectures at universities but all the teachers i attend leave blank faces i wonder if they can understand a little bit if i show them this video
amazing until you blink sweat
its been a great time i cant keep up
it looks like ai akira ikegami will appear soon lol ai may take on the role of commentator
it even includes the sound of breathing i wonder if that will be decided by the ai as well
scammer this is good
it seems like the profession of being an av actress will no longer be viable
isnt this seriously amazing
how do you make it
its true its done thumbs up
when i listen to it with this in mind i wonder if it can be said that it feels like the text is being read out without intonation but its interesting
thats amazingi wonder if the intonation is different sometimes about
has it already come this far natural is it an editing mistake if there is no caption level of thinking
i get the impression that its only happening in japan
awesome i guess ill use it for meaningless university assignments and annoying job hunting it would be fun to pay for chatgpt
is hories wifi ai
it looks like the people working at the counter will be replaced
a world where ideal handsome men and women can live stream on tiktok hours a day days a year and can ask questions sing and dance
too harshi dont feel uncomfortable at all
isnt ai now running the horiemon channel
this kind of movement is dangerous human
both are too horiemon its amazing maybe even in the future or years from now maybe todays celebrities are still alive in the worlds eyes celebrities in the entertainment industry seem to be strong
although their speaking habits and accents are different theyve gotten to the point where you cant tell unless they tell you its an ai face with tears of joy
if this happens people who want to make fake videos will be able to do whatever they want has the technology for crackdowns caught up
at first glance you cant tell it from the real thing but the emotions pauses and intonation are so disgusting that i still notice it just a scholar or someone who speaks in a flat manner moreover if you are not familiar with it you will not be able to tell it apart the value of talking directly with someone in person increases and if you dont want to meet someone leave it to ai it would be interesting to have it returned appropriately
a new version has come out again it looks amazing and im tempted to try it out
there are people who believe that this is real and in a sense its scary although its a wonderful technology
seriously its only a matter of time before the voiceover profession becomes available
when you can charge the amount with update face with open mouth
i want to play with it in the highclass chinese doll i bought last month
how much of it was ai the ai explanation was more detailed and easier to understand too amazing
this is already a human
no i dont understand the second half of ai right
horiemons ai knowledge is amazing considering that i am a human after all what azumasan said seems important
the truth isthe day when it will be possible to have an english conversation partner on par with a normal human being is really close kolya yes smiling face with open hands
im happy to have a friend who will never betray me face with tears of joy
i wonder if ai will even allow us to talk to people who have passed away
its so amazing that i dont understand what it means
there are only a few videos about the vaccines that were being promoted right youve covered all kinds of current events up until now sweat droplets youre stubbornly not covering vaccine topics are you
the ai is amazing but if you look carefully you can tell its real it would be scary if i couldnt tell at all
i was surprised to see that hories blinks looked exactly like hers lol i wonder if that slow and slow marisa will change
a year ago i was studying by focusing on the prompts but the model was evolving too quickly and i thought it was no longer meaningful so i stopped early im not smart enough to be an ai top runner and i dont have the horsepower so a year ago i switched to a job that requires physicality
will the sns era end
this is a changing era
is it the second half ai
it looks better than the real thing though
idiots who couldnt study this or elderly people would never be able to tell the difference
even the dead will come back to life
i think it would be profitable to change horiemon into gakki and sell it as my personal gakki
is it really that amazing
ai is terrible its too complete
its scary similar to the real thing
i was curious
can you also make videos thats awesome
its horiemon ai i blew it with
i guess my laugh lines are unnatural lol
the second half was so bad lol
i understand because it says its ai i can easily be fooled by this
good evening horiemon sparkles this ai has scary specs thumbs up honmabi building is hot face kowar star struck
if you let ai learn interjections and occasional mistakes it would be at a level where it wouldnt really understand
the era of remote work dark clouds gather
as someone who has lived my life without transmitting my face or voice i tend to view it in a negative way so at first i was relieved in the future there is a possibility that the world will become one where those who have been exposed are more likely to benefit for now ill wait and see the change from today is incredible
i felt a little uncomfortable but the quality was no different from the person himself it was amazing
on the one hand its amazing but on the other hand i can only imagine a terrifying future
how do you make ai videos like this
it seems that highly intelligent ai is imitating humans
response time overtime is a shame
the intonation of the ai is a bit off
theres no point in editing videos
im afraid that the number of fraudulent videos will increase i want to know how to tell the difference crying face
i dont really like this person but what he says is reasonable and above all he speaks clearly and politely other socalled influencers are selfcentered people who only care about their friends but horiemon has a high level of quality
i dont really know what is real and what is ai is ai even used for video and audio face with open mouth
emotionless horiemon ai it is now possible to express emotions although i said that i was able to understand the tone of the voice i laughed at the fact that it was so easy to read and the intonation was strange but im sure it would be natural in english instead of japanese if your japanese is already at this level the time when you can interact with ai will not be far away
too amazing about that word
real thing
its such a shame ai if you added so welcome at the end it would have been points
im worried that it will become like the terminator world face with tears of joy
please say to surprise everyone i pretended to be an ai and spoke
it was so amazing that i laughed
its a bit of a rough read but you wont notice unless you listen carefully grinning face with sweat
i can only see a future where fraudulent advertisements increase face with tears of joy
actually the first half is ai and the second half is real
the time has truly come when we can no longer tell the difference
i want to know how horiemon made the ai video
the quality of the ai images created by horiemon using note is low i want you to use midjourney instead of chatgpt
i want a wagyu tshirt lol
if its my first time meeting you you wont notice at all
if something like this were implemented most of the content in the world would disappear
it is likely to be used for investment fraud again
will there be more fake ads for horiemon
seriously amazing
i would also like an explanation of rakutens financial results face with tears of joy
amazing but i guess theres no pressure like the real thing
you can tell the true value by the response you should eat vegetables too
i feel uncomfortable with the way i move and speak because i understand but if i didnt understand i think of people would believe me
scared
no longer fake clone horiemon
this horiemon ai it cant keep up with the times anymore
this is really bad
in the second half only the mouth and voice are ai
please use the same enthusiasm when talking about rakuten mobile i wouldnt be surprised if this was expressed
just a few years ago people used to say that cg humans were creepy because of the uncanny valley but over the past few years they have become truly naturallooking
its more useful than hories emotional theory on sns
i also had enough time to use it for work
in the second half the way he talks is a bit like reading but without the captions you cant tell its ai at all
its true that i wont understand unless you tell me if you ask me i feel a certain sense of discomfort but we are living in a frightening time will humans be able to properly control this technology
the ending of gpto is said to be suspicious unexpected punch line lol i can hear geepee tea forest there are several places
rather the first one is ai
this was really ai i saw it in a short story and i thought the person himself wrote it to the ai
if i said something like this it would be considered an occult story but i can kind of understand when someone is talking to an ai i dont have any emotions or rather im not emitting anything at the brain wave level its called kotodama also in martial arts people talk about killing intent and i think people understand words through things other than sound vibrations
summarize the main points using ai and let ai speak a future where you can create multiple alter egos
toooo time
well it has nothing to do with my life as a dispatch worker lol
amazing its so amazing that i get scared i want it to be used for good but it is likely to be used for propaganda or to trigger a war
there is something strange about the face the way you use your fingers is realistic
the blinking of the eyes closely imitates the real thing lol
what is this its amazing
im already scared
teeth whats this seriously how can this happen
i dont need him anymore
enjoy your life you guys human roles disappear
it seems like all humans can do is eat and have sexual activity
ai is fine now
the way the ai speaks in the second half is like a students powerpoint presentation the quality is higher than mine
worldline horiemon who can only read scripts
this is really amazing and the speed of evolution is beyond imagination grinning face with sweat
horiemon is just a professional surprisemonger after all i guess thats what happens when you have a low educational background like horiemon
ai wont tell you to come
openai is amazing because its like sora in a year
the audio and lip sync systems are different technologies from gpto so many people think they are all gpto functions because they were combined
scammers will definitely use it
no when things are this real only evil thoughts come to mind
well its a doubleedged sword if misused remittance fraud is likely to increase
panee
im using it now and its amazing
i still feel strange about ai it has become a lot more natural since a while ago maybe its because my eyes have gotten used to it but the level of discomfort hasnt changed
human beings are completely defeated because we dont understand unless we are told and even if we are told it is difficult to understand loudly crying face
by the way this is the real horiemon right
awesome it feels a little strange at key points but you wont understand unless they tell you its ai seriously amazing
in the second half of the ai if you eliminate the small discomfort of the images you can really only tell whether there are emotions or not egg
this is not horiemon ai rolling on the floor laughing
horiemon an ai that doesnt seem to have a dark heart
its still unnatural because theres no emotional intonation this is enough to deceive people
scammer morotade horie
i think the code generation has become better now as it is less likely to make mistakes im an amateur so id like to hear a professional opinion
i see
horiemons ai was so good at acting that i almost got fooledahahaseriously
ai that can endlessly answer childrens curiosity if you were exposed to gpt when you were a child you would absorb a tremendous amount of knowledge and your ability to concentrate would improve as well as your curiosity my eyesight deteriorates though
too much
i knew the ai wasnt real because it didnt say so welcome at the end lol
wow this is amazing i was having a headache from too much analog work at work today but watching this video made me feel better grinning squinting face
too amazing of course its possible to create a scam so thats dangerous real information will always be true so reality becomes more important
well its fast but ive gotten used to kotomo
i was surprised this is
if you were listening to it at x speed you wouldnt notice it face with open mouth
there are certainly no errors to the point where i think its the real thing sometimes i wonder if im blinking abnormally often
i dont really understand it but you should at least improve your reading comprehension face with tears of joy
horie is better than horiemon
yaba
it doesnt bite at all is it obvious lol
eye movements body language timing of speaking and movement it still feels weird but if i think of him as that kind of person i guess it doesnt feel weird
you suddenly stick your face out lol
in the old ghost in the shell nd gig there is a story like video has lost its evidence but this is happening in the real world and with great accuracy
if ai started saying eh we might not be able to tell the difference sweat droplets
have we come this far yet
regulation is necessary because it is the first to be misused
amazing the intonation of the conversation is on par with the real thing
teeth this is ai the level has risen too much
there will be a lot of fraudulent advertising again there are countless people who can be fooled even by images but most people wouldnt notice if the sound was added as well
everything from his mouth movements to his body language is amazing if you dont pay attention to the pronunciation you can easily miss it if you include breathing and pauses you wont be able to tell even if you pay attention i wonder what will happen in two years
people who are fooled by ais fake advertisements are borderline intelligent zany face i m sorry facewithtearsofjoy
theres also the sound of breathing so once you adjust the facial expressions its seriously hard to tell from the real thing wow
i cant tell the difference
the ai has a breathing sound so i cant really tell
ai is more politescary
gpt seems to be talking while watching the contest
it would be perfect if love was added to ai
wow isnt that amazing horiemon ai you wont notice that its ai unless you look very carefully is this the horiemon singularity
when i hear the word ai i feel young and uncomfortable
its completely indistinguishable
i tend to lose focus
amazing a future where you can work from home and have ai attend online meetings
is this video a fake advertisement
ive already finished using the translator pocket talk and i was thinking of buying the stock since it looks like its going to be listed next year but i decided against it many jobs are likely to disappear with the advent of gpto lol
in the future the job of interpreter may disappear
chat gpt will give you more accurate answers than listening to horiemons nonsense face with tears of joy
fraud is likely to increase
horiemon who is a real person is excellent because he explains things in an easytounderstand way ai horiemon still doesnt know how to use actions
this is amazing all kinds of jobs may be taken away we may need to rethink the fundamentals of society which means that people dont have to work in the first place
its finally time to put the night into practical use
is it a combination of heygen and goto
w
fraud is on the rise
horiemon what do you think about the relationship between chat gpt and basic income
its getting closer to hal
whats really going on thats scary
im sure the next version will be so advanced that it wont be distinguishable from the real thing lets leave all the work to ai and let humans enjoy their vacation
looks like miki from parasite
i want tsunku male sign to do the ai version
you were in fukuoka for this matter it looks like he was on the jetstar that arrived at chubu airport around on the th a customer passed by in front of me but my customer service was im busy with work welcome to work i forgot to say it damn it
even if all radio stations were replaced with ai voices no one would notice
hello youtube red heart take care
although there is some discomfort in his body language and gaze his conversation is amazing
even the breathing is recreated face with tears of joy
amazing word
yoichi takahashi if horiemon had acquired fuji tv it might have become something like amazon prime by now what is the reason why global it companies are not growing in japan
i watched a demo video of gpto and it felt like it was on par with hal from a space odyssey in terms of realtime interaction capabilities its about years later than the movie but even arthur c clarke couldnt have predicted the concept of the internet well its going to accelerate from now on
the poison has been removed from horiemon and he is now acting as a perfect human in a sense its even better than the real thing lol
how is the ai in the second half realized
how can i find out how to download the app what kind of mark is it
im coming to bayside please eat something
the end of compassion grinning face with sweat
what will happen from now on i even feel fear
i have the courage to travel abroad
her lips are moving with the words amazing
this is amazing but i think its also an invention that is contributing to people becoming more and more insane
meta is overjoyed you can make money with advertising again grinning face with sweat
thats amazingthis is deceiving
i cant tell the difference if we dont seriously think about how to use ai we will truly be left behind
this guy got it
too amazing
the day when ai will be able to apologize to otani is coming soon i dont think ill apologize until then though
what that glutamyl transpeptidase a drug often found in liver tests horie chiyan im stupid so i dont understand horie chiyan im your senior at the university of tokyo after all
emotionally its still difficult but explanations are becoming more sophisticated its easy to tell if its fake or real
too bad i cant tell the difference between ai and the real thing
my life my life im writhing in agony
its a fake if you dont get mad about vegetables
eh this is too amazing
what will it be like in years at this level in this day and age including sora
really indistinguishable from the real thing at all
i wonder if this is enough for phone support etc if you can reply within seconds this is fine
this is ai no thats a lie
horiemon in the first half feels strange so maybe it was ai
its even more blurry zany face zany face
the theory that teachers are unnecessary is progressing until now there has been an argument that it would be better for popular teachers to teach via video from now on even popular teachers are no longer necessary ai horiemon should teach the class
even though this is ai it doesnt look like ai at all when i watched the demo i noticed that they had the same facial expressions eyes and movements which made me feel uncomfortable
genuine horiemon ai horiemon
is that so
eh doesnt come out at all so its not him
this tshirt that parodies the godfather is so cool smiling face with smiling eyes
in the second half of the video the technology announced by open ai today is only used to summarize the content of the talk
ai is rapidly evolving general peoples awareness is slow i feel that this technique is perfect for elderly people as well it will be helpful to receive your frank opinions
gpto is seriously too harsh many japanese people who cannot tell when a lie is a lie will continue to be deceived in the future
at this point it seems like it wont be possible unless the law is put in place even in the case of crimes it seems possible to use ai to disperse crimes
gpto
if you fix the behavior of the eyes and the speech that doesnt have human tension itll be hard to tell
he speaks more fluently than horiemon
the ship arrived in good shape lol
we are now in an era where it is up to people to decide how to use technology
this is manual subtitles for ai videos i wonder how you feel about adding subtitles lol
too dangerous
if the unnaturalness of eye movements disappears wouldnt it be difficult to tell that its an ai
no its weird i thought it was funny in some places so i blew it face with tears of joy
smiling face with smiling eyes thank you as always teacher sparkles potato thickly sliced crescent moon first quarter moon face sorry for the good shape grinning face with sweat thank you
i didnt know anything about ai because i was just watching it in the car just glancing at it i thought it was like i was watching a competition and the way he talked about it was like a project face with tears of joy
i think its often useful in business situations but in the entertainment field the more humanlike you become the more exciting it becomes even if you watch this ai video its boring if you think of it as a machine after all i think the entertainment field will eventually go back to being real people
the world of science fiction
when it comes to ai i cant get into the content it makes me sleepy sleepy face
its so harsh more and more people will be fooled on facebook lol
amazing if you dont have the ability to see through it youre likely to be deceived
become immortal
chatgpt is amazing but horie is even better two hearts
amazing i seriously dont understand you can do something like the ore ore horiemon scam are laws and regulations to protect ai morals being cracked down on im really looking forward to the future
there is a slight discomfort in the way you move your face your line of sight and your expressions but this discomfort will disappear within a few years
this is too bad
ai horiemon in the first half is amazing
mr horie i dont feel any discomfort with this ai horiemon
its too amazing i need to master it quickly
its been over a quarter of a century since i first learned about ai and started making it myself as expected you can immediately tell that this is an ai
this would be fine for counter operations at city halls and hospitals its good to be able to receive the same service nationwide its troubling that the people working at city halls in the countryside arent updated
has his excellency been possessed by a demon since the second half
ai feels weird so if you know about it youll know
i like the ai explanations because they are softer
wowi thought it was horiemon being made to read the manuscript until i noticed
i can tell its still barely an ai
ai maybe sharon apple from macross plus will no longer be a lie but the intonation is a little weird grinning face with sweat
in the future people will think that someone who speaks without hesitation is an ai if ai were to make mistakes or speak it would be difficult to distinguish it from humans
the sudden stupid old man warota
ai gentle tone
thanks dear
i dont need horiemon anymore
isnt the current generation ai too specialized in art it seems like if you make them solve math its no good at all even though its a computeri dont think artificial intelligence will ever surpass humans unless this area is cleared up
for now ill try making one starting from akira asada
ai is amazing even the breathing is real
this is seriously amazing i use it every day and i thought it was the biggest upgrade since mygpt
youtubers apology videos and daily posts could also be completed using ai
horiemon is getting closer to doraemon which is the origin of his name lol
it just feels like an investment scam lol rather i felt like i was being shown a wall that humans cannot overcome
hori aimon is enough
horiemon talking helplessly after being taken hostage lol
the audio is a bit unnatural but the video that captures the habits is amazing
actually both of these are ai
it seems like we can talk forever between gpto and gpto
the ai video is amazing but it doesnt seem to be able to express horiesans inner feelings well it seems that we are now in an era where photos videos and audio are all difficult to use as evidence in trials rather than finding reasons not to use it it would be more in the public interest to repeatedly use it and cause nonfatal injuries
beautiful horiemon unless youre an edgy person you wont be able to tell it apart from ai
its a very scary time face screaming in fear
ai horiemon is so realistic that it feels like hes desperately saying the words hes memorized so its funny
the best time has come
this is crazy i cant tell the difference w
in the future if you think this horiemon is a bit choppy and blinks a lot will it turn out to be an ai
this slight discomfort will be corrected little by little right it would be awesome if this materialized
the emotion of anger is necessary to be a human being but can you raise your child to be a person with a rich spirituality that is separate from emotion and can handle the wasted time of anger on their own seems to be a future issue
if you just listen to the voice without watching the video it will sound like a boring uninflected reading is there room for improvement in the details
is the hormone theory that ai pretends to be a good idea
hmm i guess horiemon seems to be interested and theres no talk about api and i dont have any talk from the perspective of a paid member so i can tell its not horiemon
too amazing i dont understand this
the ai version is very calm horiemon lol
if you listen to it at x you cant tell the difference anymore
letting ai earn youtube playback time lol
i thought i would definitely handle it
thats outrageous
are the human parts of horiemon in the second half also ai lip sing is perfect
it would sound more serious if there was an eh or well between conversations
theory that horiemon is not needed
its been quite competitive with claude ops from what ive been feeling since the morning it looks like gpto won by a narrow margin
how do i make this
than that replicon vaccine i want you to talk about it
i think it would sell well if i sold it using horiemons finger puppets
finally is it really ai i feel angry at myself for thinking that grinning face with sweat
is this ai image also created by ai
assuming that the audio is chatgpto i wonder what kind of generation ai was used to create the images that move along with the audio
this isnt because the ai is amazing the person who made this video is amazing
even reproducing the breathing its amazing
its amazing but its full of bad feelings rarely if you dont make it meta it will fly
its true that eating vegetables is delicious
oh my god lol
theres a huge difference from horiemon himself speaking and he cant even say welcome at the end of the comment ai cannot bring out the charm of the person himself
really awesome its scary amazing
it looks like announcer and call center jobs that only involve reading manuscripts are going to disappear
ai horiemon is definitely amazing but you can still tell the difference
rakutens financial results have been announced please explain
how we were manipulated by the speaker did you understand lol
wow the video is so amazing i cant believe it
its really amazing if you use it in the correct way it can be very useful on the other hand it seems like there will be people who abuse it and im not sure if ill be able to tell them apart
it may be the latest ai for us ordinary people but it seems to be a technology that has been used at the core of the military in the united states and russia for about yearswe ordinary people are always provided with handmedowns so grinning face with sweat so it seems that todays military is using even more amazing technology the other day a salesman at a large company told me that instead of using tablets they have developed a device that displays an image that stands out in space and changes the image by brushing it away with your hand im doing it face with open mouth it feels exactly like something out of the movie iron man now if we calmly think about the fate of humanity that relies on ai it seems that eventually humans will stop thinking and what ai says will become the basis of their actions and the ego will disappear eventually elon musks technology will separate the consciousness from the bodyas musks technology progresses the body will no longer be necessaryi can imagine that if we dont turn off the power well be trapped in a neverending world thinking face meta virtual etc is that really the ideal world
a truly indistinguishable level by the end of this year well probably be flooded with videos of ai talking like this
looking at the announcement of the number of new insurance applicants in the us the other day the majority of applicants are concentrated in new york and ca and the occupations of the unemployed are concentrated in brain workers such as programmers and the number of job openings has decreased significantly i am in other words in the united states there are actually no ai jobs for brain workers such as programmers on the other hand looking at the number of job openings in japan it is not decreasing and it can be said that the transition to ai is not progressing at all i would like to hear a detailed explanation of the current state of the transition to ai in the united states and the delay in the use of ai in japan
better than you
face screaming in fear too amazing
you can only judge whether it is an ai by not picking it or biting it so in the second half this is ai
its amazing but scammers will use all sorts of tricks to deceive you so you have to be more careful about feeling uncomfortable than ever before
scammers are thriving
is it advertising
if you look closely at horiemon youll see that he has an aggressive hairstyle
is it a characteristic of ai that there is no inflection in the way they speak
when i read the second half of the sentence i thought so lol i wonder if they are investing in openai
hakata has such beautiful places its like korea
horiesan is just reading the competition grinning face with sweat
what service or ai can i use to create the video of the ai talking in the second half
will you continue to live even if your lover dies isnt it great
theme human can be created by checking the rating
its so amazing that we should pass a digital regulation bill and go back to paper insurance cards
hories wifi is starting to look like an ai video
ai seems smarter its a robot after all
the only movement of his eyes is that he isnt looking at the camera but other than that theres nothing suspicious about him
picture is this fake
so cute party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper party popper
picture picture too amazing this video is no longer evidence
i do not understand
the ai looks grumpy
this is amazing there are still some strange movements but if it doesnt say that its an ai on the screen ill just assume its the real person
previously the video was basically unnatural but sometimes it looked like reality but this time it felt basically real but sometimes it felt strange too dangerous lol
hakata city is in fukuoka prefecture mr horie have you ever been to the old inunaki tunnel a famous haunted spot in fukuoka prefecture that was made into a movie is there one face with open mouth
is this why they have strengthened their crackdown on fake news consent
wow if you lower the image quality to the lowest level you can see its real
yeah is this really ai is it possible to do something like this in terms of voice quality speaking style movements and facial expressions i never expected the world to change so quicklyi wonder what will happen to the world from here
have you thought about the text yeah i cant catch up
it was my first time watching horiemons video but in the second half there were ads like a phone book which made me laugh
people who know horiemon through casual reading will find the conversation strange
this is also ai right
fraudulent advertising is progressing
highest highest
it can also learn and output the persons eye blinks mouth movements word endings hand and neck gestures etc even if there are still some unnatural parts left im sure that will be resolved soon so i wonder how a third party can judge whether an image is ai or reality its an amazing technology and i dont think it can be stopped but im concerned about how laws will be put in place in case its misused fake advertising incitement fraud pornography anything is possible
ai horiemon is crazy i seriously cant tell the differencei feel a bit strange in the intonation of the voice but if i change the sound quality or change the pitch a little i wont be able to tell
wow thats crazy red exclamation mark i wonder how they made this al video its obvious how great gpto is when a normal person can compare it as expected horiesan thank you red heart
there is almost no change in the breathing rate during voice production or the speaking speed i dont bite anymore it feels strange but you wont understand unless its called ai its not just a matter of portrait rights but rather individuals themselves will likely be turned into data i wonder if there is a digital watermark in the data created by ai so that it can be identified as ai
horiemon looks like hes being blackmailed into reading it too amazing
ive never seen horiemon talk so politely second half
thats amazingi dont need a school teacher
its amazing i think people who arent interested in ai dont even know that things like this are becoming possible more and more and they dont question what theyre saying even if its fake
horiemon is the one who talks about rakuten with a grin and ai is the one who talks calmly
scary this technique is dangerous
interesting comparison with ai horiemon the ai no longer feels strange and the information is concrete and persuasive to the point where its safe to talk about it at a general meeting of shareholders however the content of raw horiemon is easier to understand and im sure he speaks in a way that even an idiot can understand
whats scary is not that horie is the one who can make this but that anyone can make it of course i can dictate the content of the talk and conversely if i can just think of what horie might talk about and make it into a video i can do that as well many argue that its obvious that we dont need youtubers anymore so the value of characters remains but its only a matter of time after all characters can still be created if you tell them to create a character that will be popular they will even create that for you this is what smart people say when they say that humans have no value and that its less likely that humans arent ai
it will be safe if you dont give it personality or authority on the other hand if you give it the other way the human position suddenly becomes questionable
apple seems to be introducing gpt to ios so it looks like the era will come when apple will dominate smartphones android
this is crazy i felt a little strange along the way but im mostly human i dont need humans lol
in the second half it would be more convincing if they told me that it wasnt actually ailol is it possible to do lip syncing and gestures so naturally no its definitely used for fraud lol
real jarvis is almost here
we dont need an announcer anymore
after all the generalization of this technology is terrifying and the ability and ethics of those who receive it will be tested
please dont let me say come on grinning face with sweat its scary in many ways after all a real person is better
it would be convenient if i could have an ai like this do my work presentations
the ai video was times more amazing than i imagined
do androids dream of electric sheep human or ai the ais eye movements are a little weird no maybe its because of preconceived notions
i want a boxing battle with hiroyuki
thats really bad are there really going to be a lot of unemployed people
if you say ai it sounds like ai but unless you say it you wont notice
indistinguishable from the real thing its really amazing
hey hey this is really amazing
human horiemon has a habit of saying eh at the beginning of each word so people who are familiar with it can tell it apart
let ai horiemon manage livedoor management
i usually do freelance web design using chatgpt until now there were many unclear points about chatgpt when creating content and to be honest it was unusable ive only used it for one day but here are my impressions maybe what im doing will be completely taken over by chatgpt next year thats what it feels like i was surprised to see that the output speed increased by about times but what really surprised me was the accuracy of the japanese i cant quantify it but i think my japanese has become about times more natural than before it was a day that made me keenly realize that i too need to start another business
hello you look so disgusting
all i can say is that its amazing i cant tell this from the real thing face with open mouth
i wonder if i can also do translation work
thats scary flushed face
what a time
you cant do business without actually meeting people and having a conversation with them looking at each other this is scary i cant even trust the phone
i see now i know how to make it thank you
i dont think it would feel out of place at all if you let your child learn to look at the camera during greetings and closings such as hello everyone or what is
i was surprised that the ais tone was just like horie maybe if it was on the radio i wouldnt be able to understand it anymore it seems that radio can be replaced by ai as soon as possible
welcome cyclone grinning squinting face cyclone
analog work is still a long way off but with digital work people no longer need to work under stress the digital masterpiece ai completely incorporates human interfaces visual and auditory in terms of processing power it not only exceeds that of humans but also language knowledge grammar voice body language images they make decisions on their own and communicate using expressions appropriate to the other person
its all a dream what i see in my dreams even this life
i still laugh at the extremely shallow information
im the type of person who is okay with it as long as im good but im glad that horiemonsan seems to be doing well
the last ai horiemon is so scary face with open mouth red heart
response time lol
a dull old mans partner rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
eh isnt it really amazing lol once the second half is shown its over
its amazing to the point where it turns you upside down we no longer need average to lowquality teachers instructors and instructors
thats excellent
its almost perfect with breathing space
the importance of facetoface meetings has increased
o is for vegetable
more and more idiots are being used as tools that have given up on thinking
indeed unless someone told me it was ai it would look like the real thing and the way it spoke would be difficult to understand if it becomes possible to express intonation facial expressions body language and even quirks in the way we speak will we leave free streaming to ai
gradually humans will no longer be needed
things like this are left up to each persons own ethics but humans are weak against desire
i was surprised that it even included breathing
isnt audio supported yet is the api supported
i thought it was amazing but it might be nice if there were irregularities like the one where the ai gets sleepy and the waves of conversation that break up from time to time in the real thing
wasnt horiemon a real person face with open mouth i didnt know what ai was grinning face with sweat
as i was listening i felt like mr horie was reading too much so when i looked at the screen i was surprised to see that it said this is an ai
it must be a lie if thats the case id like the ai to decide to say so welcome back at the end lol
the ending doesnt sound like horiemon at all just the tone of voice is similar
you can tell its an ai because it stands still and speaks i have to fidget lol
i blink too much and the image looks strange there wasnt much difference in the sound except for the slightly less smooth tongue smiling face with smiling eyes
almost the same as ai
fraud is accelerating
yeah this isnt the last video deepfake right maybe its just that the text was written very close to hories and other than that its just him right with the currently released ai technology there is no deep fake that can move hands so well and although the voice is weak you can tell its different because it contains noise realize the misunderstanding
horiemon is more emotional ai is quiet
if this was played id think horiemon was talking
if you look closely the movements of his facial expressions seem unnatural but the muscles around his mouth have become much more natural than before its scary
yay amazing
awesome party popper
it didnt change much
seriously this is terrible grinning face with sweat
rather mr horie on the ai side does not stagnate
it seems like the internet world will be full of scammers
it feels strange smiling face im glad im japanese party popper
this is deceiving grinning face with sweat i hope it doesnt get abused
oh amazing
i recently signed up for gpt for the first time i guess ill try playing with it later
politics can now be done with ai thank you to the liberal democratic party for everything winking face thumbs up musical notes
chatgpto has not released audio yet
its a person from the past
if i could reproduce the strength and weakness of words in important parts i wouldnt know anymore
as a security measure it seems like there will be a standard feature for humans to tell ai to identify whether it is ai or not and the singularity will come when it no longer can do thathowever it seems like the better the performance the better the recognition will be
i would give it around points because the intonation of the voice is strange but if you fix that itll be perfect
when i asked gpt himself he said optimize
i havent tried any aibased products that have been able to understand japanese or english properly at normal conversation speed you must speak slowly and simply so that it is easy to hear youtubes automatic subtitles are too much
i have a keen sense of smell when it comes to topics like this
seriously the ai in the second half is terrible ive been listening to it at x recently and i cant really tell the difference
is this ai video also glto its definitely different isnt it
i only say general things
singularity
i lost to yutabon in a wrestling match and my very existence was taken over by the ai im sad
i think scammers would enjoy this the most
too cool
ai you can copy the voice but you cant copy the facial expressions huh
i cant tell the ai fake monster apart its too amazing
the faint uncanny valley that remains with the feeling of humans being taken over by computers feels like watching a classic science fiction movie which is really cool i would like to see boston dynamics robots equipped with this ai
i thought that such realtime response would be available in when nm and nm semiconductors would be released but i never expected it to be available in the first half of
novita wow horiemon is dead japanet takata dont worry our horiemon ai uses special deep learning technology to perfectly reproduce horiemon now available at a bargain price of xx million yen during the horiemon memorial campaign customization that doesnt say bad things about ry
even hories wifi commercial was created using ai thats too amazing
i wonder about the development speed i wonder if something even more amazing will come out soon
its a good time
an incredible technology has been born humanity has reached the next stage
we dont need people stealing wages
i was born in but i cant believe this isnt him
from now on there will be a greater need for the ability to see through people i have a feeling that if you dont trust yourself instead of depending on others you wont know who to trust and youll be forced to do whatever you want conspiracy theories have also become more active which is a big deal
this is a level you wouldnt notice if you were drunk lol
there are so many people who cant tell the difference its shocking there are so many blind people in this world fearful face
its starting to be fun
im sure its amazing but focus on more useful things i want you to include it when will you make an ai traffic light how long until you die do i have to wait for unnecessary traffic lights
is the video also ai if so thats too amazing japan is also said to have domestically produced ai but will they be able to catch up
the ai video in the second half is definitely amazing however i felt like i couldnt understand what he was saying because he was speaking in a flat and matteroffact manner i guess that will continue to evolve
i might not know if i didnt say its a late ai however the ais movements are still very responsive i dont have any control and i feel bad its definitely better raw
the announcer is finished
i thought we were going to talk about rakuten financial results today lol
i sincerely hope that this technology is not misused
yay yay were now in an age where its okay to let ai summarize and speak for itself
i always watch it at double speed but at double speed i cant tell its ai at all
after all it feels strange when images are rendered using ai the audio doesnt feel strange at all
this is seriously dangerous i think there will be a huge increase in fraudulent advertisements lol
the second half also looked fine even at double speed how can we make this distinction
people lets quickly realize that poutine biden and kissy are all ai
the end of the system si and consulting industry is in sight
it would be great if it could be used for npcs in mmorpgs
yes
it feels like horiemon is just reciting a comp the level is much higher than i expected
this is ai because there is no swearing
even if horiemon doesnt have anything to do with it this youtube video wont go around
im looking forward to the future
horiemon youtube should be all ai
i didnt understand the ai at all at first i understand that the pronunciation of handling is strange but i understand
people with slightly poor eyesight and slightly impaired hearing will be fooled in the second half
isnt it too dangerous its so amazing its scary lol
atsushi tamura was also surprised
in the openai video there was a scene where realtime translation was being done and i thought it was amazing how they clearly took emotions into consideration and expressed them through voice hal and samantha
amazing evolution it feels strange if youre used to seeing it but its hardly noticeable
streamed from on my smartphone grinningfacewithsweat i dont think anyone who watched it would notice
wow lol
i think there will be a lot more people getting scammed
im really looking forward to whats next excited
amazing the world of perman copy robots is coming
its a bit repetitive but we dont really need an announcer or a weather forecaster
i miss the colonel bug from metal gear
amazing from now on you wont be able to watch the news unless all videos have an nft tag attached to them to ensure their authenticity you can still make money from ti
its tiring to talk without taking a breather it seems like its being read as tired horiemon or possessed horiemon the real thing is more energetic
awesome i still feel a little nervous but its become much more natural
the real thing has quite a lot of filler words like um and uh but the ai doesnt have any of that
is this serious
is the camera moving a little even though its ai it no longer looks like the real thing
i want horiemon to teach everyone how to make money with ai i dont even have to go to school its such a waste
ai has deep nasolabial folds
its dangerous its dangerous
its amazing but if you look closely it still feels strange
the ai horiemon speaks in a boring way so i can tell the difference face with tears of joy
thats awesome speaking of spoilers this video is also ai but most viewers probably dont realize it lol
what if the first half is ai and the second half is real
did he use ai to make him say it in that case i wonder if its what the person himself said
the explanation of the ai is accurate lol lol
sometimes its funny how they do weird facial tricks but im sure theyll soon get rid of that and become more sophisticated
the second half is just horiemon
if its a video with no emotional ups and downs this is fine
this will definitely be exploited
no no no no it just looks real finally ai has also crossed the line
isnt the first half already ai
as ai progresses we will no longer need anyone but the best talent
is it made by omni
ai is amazing lol
i knew this would happen eventually but its already science fiction programming schools were popular a while ago but now its a nocode world lol
his mouth is moving properly as if hes talking
wow when i take my smartphone away and look at it the audio and video dont seem out of place at all
can gpto also generate videos can i use my own voice as well can you do that
i really cant tell the difference
fraud damage caused by horiemon fake advertisements is increasing face with tears of joy
this is it for now no one will understand
seriously its me its me please stop calling me grandma
the excessive evolution of robots means the decline of humans is ai really necessary
its gpto omni
also it would be perfect if they started saying bad things about rakuten
i wonder if ai can solve the problem of the declining birthrate
the time has come when it will be really dangerous if the whole nation does not realize that ai performance has advanced to this extent
the content of the explanation the gestures the movement of the eyes it just looks real
all i can say is that its amazing i want to meet my grandpa who passed away when i was young
they wont let me go
software is the reorganization of work thank you ai
this is seriously dangerous if you dont think about your future job
its so amazing im laughing
i might not understand if it gets between er and so on facial expressions in response to conversations have become the only distinguishable factor
is this real its so amazing that i have to question it
the ai version is a perfect copy of horiesans way of blinking
its crazy that this happened a year and a half after chatgpt came out evolution is too fast
thats a lie
what should i believe
english conversation school has started uploading app development
horiemon is really excited in the first half in the second half horiemon is uninterested in reading the competition due to the promotion
oh no lol you wont notice this unless you tell me
ai is amazing but it seems like there will be more scam videos lol
this is definitely amazing you can definitely tell the difference but if it becomes more sophisticated it will probably become much harder to tell
is it the ai in the second half i was surprised
its an amazing technology but human cognition cant tell the difference anymore face with tears of joy
stop suddenly rolling your eyes lol
your excellency demon horie
you can create an ai human with a good face and a good voice and have them interview you online
i was scared when i opened my eyes
hories timing of blinking is terrible
it behaves a little suspiciously but it looks like the real thing
the real thing has a lot of ehs ai doesnt have eh
people are no longer needed its too early
hey theres almost no difference
hmm
oh no i have to use it
i dont know whats true in this world anymore
i want to make this using myself as a model
the ai horiemon in the second half is too scary lol i felt a little uncomfortable with the explanations that sometimes included hand movements but when i looked at it at a glance i didnt think there was much of a difference i guess its unnatural that he speaks words smoothly and without making any mistakes when explaining things which is different from a real person
its more polite than horiemon
it would be interesting if horiemon was a material for ai to imitate clown face yellow heart
dont say anything inappropriate
this is terrible facewithrollingeyes
is there any reason to pay for gpt
jarvis in making
i can see this being very helpful with learning stuff theres probably also a fair chance that companies like adobe will feed it their software code so it can directly open and guide you to some specific setting or effect in premiere or after effects so much potential
im also noticing they are only using apple devices why
seems like microsoft copilot was on the right track for productivity
so i pay for gpt and now gpto has been launched should i cancel the paid subscription of gpt is gpt better than or the same as gpt can somebody please clear that up for me thanx in advance
narcissus mirror meets pandoras box
im so curious as to when we will get this newer version i have gpt o but not any of the enhanced voice capabilities does anyone know
i want to install this on my ipad too what the name of the app available on appstore
so whats going to happen to my subscription
so should i stop my subscription to gpt will o make it not worth it anymore since its free
man the italian women is beautiful
some confusion around where do i get it and its slower than they showed in the demo gpto has rolled out on some accounts at least on my account it is an option however it seems like the updated gptvoice is taking longer to roll out so even though the app might show gpto you may not necessarily have access to gpto voice the way to tell if you have it is if youre able to enable the camera while on gptvoice if all you see is the pause button and the x button you probably dont have it yet so it will be responding slower hope that clears things up
i just had an insane revelation i would imagine that many people make the claim that ai is not actually able to think or comprehend what its doing because it was just programmed to do that but arent humans and other intelligent animals just programmed to do that have not human and animal brains been slowly evolving over time from nothing to where we are today i mean really think about it both humans and ai are able to think the only difference between an ai and a human is consciousness but how can we ever define what being conscious truly is as a whole if we havent experienced anything other than human consciousness defining consciousness is like living in a cave and trying to guess what the weather is outside you need to actually be outside of the cave to know whatever noises of a storm you hear could just be coming from something inside of your cave
that screenshare tool is insane dude
i feel like theyre getting government funds i really cant see how this is profitable
i cant think of a single purpose for it not one what does it do that i cant
ok what that app name is it available on apple store
you clearly can ask it for a specific tone so i dont understand what you are complaining about when it comes to it as an assistant
yeah well chat gpt o is cool but gemini pro is on a whole upper level google will crush openai by far
the chatgpt weve been waiting for
the vocal fry face vomiting
google is peeing itself right now
impressive as it may i find her overenthusiastic tone draining on my social battery
glados in your pocket
why would i keep my plus subscription now face with raised eyebrow
free so our data is more worth than d
and i spend spends rs to get chat gpt plus neutral face
it sounds like talking with meghan markle confounded face
amaaazing
lol omnipotent lololol classical education is lost on the youth its like the kids are speaking like a phonetic ai generated yt voice
who gives a shit about ai telling a bed time story lol
nothing is free what are they taking from us that we dont know about
this has black mirror written all over this skull
its mind blowing that this is all done by one model we are getting closer to agi by the day
is the data analysis jobs safe after this
very scary for the human imagine oneday the ai came out the box and install with the physical robotic body
ok so when can i have my dommy mommy ai voice that admonishes me to do my work in a stern yet sweet voice but deep down i cry because i lost my family at a young age and never felt motherly affect and now search for it through ai
imagine if they integrate this into the npcs of gta
sam altman is the worst person to hand the future to
hopefully we can dial back the expressiveness as its pretty dystopianwe no longer need mum and dad to do the bedtime routine
hello joshua do you know if gpto free version have any type of telemetry such as login user input voices and strings
turn down emotional affect please
how do i enable this
only thing left is put ai inside of an android human and start detroit become human
why would i pay for gpt then
its going to remember things about me oh i see where the free part comes into play now
my response rate is no response face with tears of joy sorry our servers are busy or something to that effect
remember when jarvis was science fiction
agree with your take on the expressiveness felt too over the top for me too hope we do have controls other than just asking chatgpt to use its inside voice every request
bruh thats just creepy really
tars set bubbliness to
when is this released
holy crap the fact its free not sure if google can top this tomorrow
you gaind an subscriber xp
the average person is still gonna pretend that ai is just a phase
upload image not working in my android phone why
better than being able to customize the emotion level and better than just asking it to do so would be if it took its tone cue from you and the content of your interaction the way a person would do
i really want to try this model
none of what is shown actually work
mine hasnt updated yet grinning face with sweat i wanna try it
the best the greatest good the best the greatest good the best the greatest good the best the greatest
always remember if you are not paying for the product than you are the product the only reason for this to be free is that they want all of your data for free

clears throat to fake an exuberantly nice tone of voice more convincingly omg it s so lovely to meet you young shodan redheart
this is a horror movie
a bedtime story about robots and love the only question is it for children or adaults smiling face with halo
bro with that personality im falling in love mid work day
when this version will be available for everyone
last year chatgpt could barely answer a question without errors and asking it twice before getting the right answer months later its smarter than me we are living in an interesting time
the question is does it get freaky
i think the fact theyll release it for free to every user means that they have something even better waiting to be announced for the plus subscribers
umm what brand tshirt is that you are wearing
man the see just how far we have come in months where are we going to be in years
im shook
it can even distinguish between him and heri wonder why i hate this world stuff like this has literally zero purpose
ohh a bedtime story about robots and love growing heart i got you covered smiling face with hearts it was at this moment i almost died from the cringenot just the ai voice speaking like an cooperate psychopath trying to sound extra nice but also from knowing someone signed this off and though yeah man thats the sht
its math is a joke
if apple goes with this it will sell a lot if iphone s
when it sings it sounds like a sim lol
when can we get hands on the gpto
i am scared now seeing this because i am only in the first year of bca jobs seems to be in danger now crying face crying face
i have access to the gpto yet i do not have access to the realtime vision function how can i enable realtime vision function thanks
its pretty crap so far fails to connect nearly every attempt
i bought their plus with new o and those options are not available anywhere so next false advert
i never got the update is there a release date for this version
this is on another level exploding head makes siri look archaic
i cannot wait to be able to choose from celebrity voices snoop dogg youre hired as my ai assistant
she was killing time telling him she had a story like a standup comedian with a heckler kills a couple minutes coming up with the right response face with tears of joy
this in smart glasses like the reyban meta ones an you could have her meta ai isnt quite there
i dont know why some people are saying the voice is too excited clearly you never watched the movie her which is precisely what its based off of sam even said so so if you want a boring monotone one then just use a basic voice i think her voice is perfect and it makes me happy i love the bubbly attitude just because its an assistant doesnt mean it has to sound boring
response time is on their campus g local wifi not local cell tower your mb updown wont be fast enough
its getting more and more flirty
scarlett johansson
this is not going to end well for us
does that mean gpt subscription is useless what now
great video thank you
its hella freaky that this is actually happening
gpto is free for all it says you need to have the month subscription are you sure i cant get it free
bye bye useless teachers
one more year and human will be obsolete
will it be rolling out to the android app as well
not so sure about it yet these features i only had text responses but no images or calls like i used to had with app for iphone
so a glorified alexa
so it seems its actually super limited when free i think i just had access convo per day a massive caveat there
whats really scary about ai its advancing at a pace impossible for human to keep up if you learn a skill today tomorrow its obsolete i just dont know which skills to work on anymore
the end of privacy
yandexs alice home assistant already has this kind of stuff for months uses yandexgpt answers superfast the texttospeech is pretty good but you wouldnt know it because its evil russia however it cant recognize video
why i cant access it for free they asked for monthly subscription crying face
everytime i go on it just bring me to
your assistant needs to be overly caffeinated to keep up with you especially with the amount of requests chatgpt gets
when i can get o
why is my app still and the paid version is even the desktop version is not o yet
i dont know what to say im just kind of upset im sure this is super exciting for a lot of people but as someone who already has a complicated relationship with tech and how it influences my everyday this just seems like too much im strained between loving that this is possible and dreading the implications im only in my s and already feel like theres a new tech that i wish would just go away despite this feeling i am full of hope that this will only do good for our future
yup its over for us
i just wish they would have named it hal and used the voice from the movie that would have been perfect
well thats awesome looking forward to it
this thing just killed private teaching this thing just killed personal asistants this just can make man businesses boom
all i want is another singing glados
not available
it knows the ages of my kids and one of their names from previous typed searches it scared me at first when it said their name without me asking
i think you can adjust the excitement in her voice by setting that in the memory feature
god just please put this in an echo dotlike assistant device now its already a billion times better than alexa and google home im sorry i didnt get that times a day what junk
openai research staff better not upload it into a doll and bring it home
well the delay times are similar or worse than gpt if i say hey how are you to gpt o it took several seconds before it even responded and im a paying customer its not like the ad
every time i watch something like this i feel like i should work x times harder or at least the bear minimum
you look lonely i can fix that ahh ai
that overly peppy tone is annoying af
best summary out there kudos
not really omni until i can ask it to identify smells
they weirdly smiled all the time
it sounds insincere
because i cant find gpt th when they put it for everyone
here we are an ai is better than talk to a woman
i think its possible to customise the voice
ill never forget how gpt helped me pass my philosophy class smiling face with open hands
im hating the expressiveness be a robot
not free it was capped at prompts and images
why am i paying for gpt then
o says a month
now give it jarviss voice and we have a winner
i am already using voice feature many more on lol
less emotions tras
they call it gpt because you just saw million teaching jobs evaporate
i am so excited about the ai its awesome and way way way better the over priced siri in iphones
what does o stand for
for me i got it but only the chat the ability to have a conversation with gpt vanished from my app completely and i have no remembering function or anything just the usual but faster chatting and gpt stuff
its really dangerous they can use our voice that means people can commit crime with these ai also it will surely take away a lot jobs people will be losing their income source
black schmirror
exactly what i need my phone to sound like scarlet johanson talking with me like another human being especially making me think im dating my phone while processing the divorce with my current wife
the most important thing about this is the people who control the information it is giving and able to give currently its a small group of people from a specific region in the states it needs to represent everyones needs and ideas worldwide not just them or they can control what is and isnt right also the media sources and government have been used a tool to suppress ideas lately but those are the people directing this information we cant allow that
free collecting users personal data for something else
no i like my assistants like i like my chihuahuas perma excited d
goodbye jobs
i think i dont have to wait till
when will this come out brother
googles in danger
why did make her sound like an airhead
clapping hands
come brutally criticize my chill beats
hey how can i use the gpt o
no way it can read my handwriting skull
gpto is not completely free why are you saying that
will gpt o be more accurate and reliable
what about the mass unemployment
at this rate someone is gonna fail in love with her face with tears of joy
slutty chatgpt o
yeah im really just shocked how fast we have progressed with ai in a year man this honestly starting to get scary
screen share mhhhh gaming is gonna get wild
singularity is close
wow flushed face cant wait to start to use it red heart
the voice is so obnoxious haha
how do you get this on the app store on android
i find it funny when these nerds go about making a voice for the ai they make it like an extremely sociable affluent and hyper extroverted person exact opposite of their personality
more closer to jarvis star struck
gee i wonder why its free
alhamdulillah by this rate there wont be a need for women anymore inshallah folded hands
i remember when i watched the movie her for the first time i thought to myself i hope i get to live to see technology like this someday not only is this right on the cusp of that i think we are only a couple to a few years away from it being as capable and seamless as the ai in the movie
im kinda worried about us more than ai technologies like how are we gonna be like with those ai tools i can easily imagine someone who has never interacted with any human so no longer able to think about the others feeling or something haha
makes siri look like a toy
it says cheaper wym free
can i put my gf voice on this thing probably not gonna end will but anywayss
this ai has such a flirty tone i guarantee that my wife will be jealous of it not joking
is it available now
i like how openai was able to make a more impressive real time demonstration than what google was able to do when literally faking it
so whats the reason to pay if it will be free
i dont get if this is going to be free for everyone i mean really
they just killed rabbit r
sounds like a condescending karen
it doesnt even work today overloaded network it says maybe i should stop paying for it
openais site says it wont be free but cheaper
cool name
tony starks ai assistant isnt too far after all face with tears of joy
the teaching part is what got me surprised can you imagine what this will be like in the future
her is beginning its real
humane ai pin has sam altman as the share holder so
so i should unsubscribe from chat gpt now that its free
i wonder why they made it free im sure theres a catch somewhere grinning face with sweat
when we can use this o because i try it but the voice is not the o version i think
how to use
normal people worried about losing their jobs me skynet
give the plus version scarlett johansson voice and it will have more subscription than every service out there combined lol
now we just need to decide as a species is this what we want a world where the things that make us human our most valuable assetsstengths and even weaknesses are easily and chealpy reproduced where art and creative diciiplines are viewed with even less value as they are currently where every job that could possibly be a rewarding persuit to undergo is consumed by ai who can do basically good enough vesion while corporate profits soar and economies collapse cause if its not the oppertunity to say anything about how this goes is pulling away from us and im afraid there will come a timesoon where that oppertunity to shape ai into something that helps us all of us and not just companies that used to have to pay people for goods and services
even ai express more emotion than me crying face
im sure many plus users left
you can hear the judgement in her voice when she says oh about robots and love grinning face with sweat
why are they not talking about the video chat thats hugeand new right
who needs a real girlfriend when we have joi
how come every vid is just showing the demo vid and not actually testing this im finding the actual results for my testing is nothing like the demo
we are getting close to like cortona like in halo aware
cant imagine the world in years ahead
this is a shit product in almost every logical sense
will the free version now be able to generate images
on the horizon of the entire world changing the ability to predict the future has dissolved we see our jobs on the cusp of disappearing and we just keep going for now its bizarre town i dont see how we arent headed for a postcapitalist society very very soon there will be nothing ai cant do far better than us we gotta get ready for that world fast
question how do you switch between the versions gpt gpt or gpto on the android app
i am waiting on the skits of asian mom gpt where they berate you on your low grades or needing help
yes its faster but by no stretch of the imagination is it smarter its actually noticeably worse than gpt turbo as anyone whos used it will admit myself included
good bye ladies with weird attitude
its my siri unamused face unamused face
what shocks me the most is that they are going to distribute it for free i am used to the fact that all these amazing things are quite expensive so it is difficult for ordinary people to get and use them and so on the one hand it seems to be a lie something like a scam this proposal is so impossible to perfect on the other damn it its worth it im looking forward to using it
what google failed to do few months ago
index pointing up light skin tone
the new voice and alwayschipper emotion system sounds sooooo much like the notcortanabutdefinitelyyoungercortana replacement ai in halo infinite i hope you can rename the voice prompt because id definitely give it a halo ai name
its insane to think that ai basically blew up over night like a few years ago ai models like these seemed like a gimmick more than anything but now theyre getting their own voices i am genuinely both terrified and excited what the future holds
skynet vibes closer and closer everyday
anyone not able to use the voice feature after the update
whats the message limit for this
cant wait im going to put this on another phone and phone my mom tell her thats my girlfriend so she doesnt think im lonely af
the feature you are asking for future are always in lol big lolololololololololololol
i can really see how this could be used in a near future for learning good teaching can be used for everyone allover the world
whats that app face with open mouth
thats insane face screaming in fear
years only years and well have an ia exactly like the movie her
this is some star wars android type stuff
non of these new features work on my app hich is ios there are no new updates either
limited access to gpto
and whats the benefit of paying
free means they are selling every single data point about you
when everyone is busy reviewing ipads you brought up something that is actually interesting
imagine it being able to use your own voice as the assistant
can you give a link where i can acces to chatgpt o
can it live translate to english in real time
devils work
great time to be alive party popper
rabbit r
when is this going to be released
how will this change the world this is revolutionary like the industrial revolution
bro thats sick
hi i was very impressed with the enhanced voice capabilities of the gpto in this video and how it made the dialog more natural and expressive
the screen share is absolutely wild you can ask the gpt to test you questions through voice as youre sharing your screen explainingdoing the math its like a replacement to an actual teacher what the fuck
thats free why do i need the gpt plus subscription
sounds like a fake positive spin class instructor
the voice is fake nice
its free
hey jarvis thats all i want to say one day
ai is the next big thing after its little brother the internet only a million times smarter
where is scarlet johanson when you need her
i dont get it should i cancel my subs as its free now
does this kill rabbit or one and ai pen
fake innocence and excitement is sexy i dont think so
its awesome but i hope its not a talented model behind the screen loll
how do you get access to this
hey chat gpt never try to be a human or praise me again and i will never say please or ask you how you are got that
we are getting girlfriend boysss
im lonely she can fix that
ai gf when
they gonnna go ham with this in sex dolls
idk if its because im slavic but i have that overly affectionate voice
does it have memory meaning can i remember your prior conversations is it location aware
how can i get it as an iphone app
that is great what is the name of the app
its result does feel better than gpt
gpto rabbit jarvis
with so many jobs soon to become obsolete at least housing will become cheaper finally people will start working in jobs that actually matter like construction
this will be a game changer in health and telemedicine
how to download this for free at iphone
still up to data
chatgpts over energized personality just tells you a lot about its creators all young engineers about id say and mostly american engineers
where download o my android app has not updated
my mind is blown too
so it performs the exact same i only care about it being less stupid thats my primary concern if it hasnt improved on the metrics we have for testing models its not all that interesting free is nice i guess but im not hard up for dollars lol
lose the hat
please download to the playmarket
if apple partners with them and this becomes the new seri then im sold
once it gets the codes its game over
thanks josh may i check are there any incremental value to pay for dollars every month
say goodbye to every single customer service jobs that are over the phone tech support banks government pretty much anything call center will be replaced with this in the very near future just more jobs going byebye with this technology
wait so its feee now
and we are the product for training this ai there is no other benefits other than training for making it free for the public as we already know it costs a lot of money to run these ai and they will never provide anything without gain we are the training tools for this free ai
nerds need to stop ruining society
you can use it right now its literally the movie her irl only thing missing is scarlets voice
i want it in avas voice
i told it to write a poem about someone with a name then when it was finished i told it baba because i like it it then generated a new poem with instead the name baba i felt like that was unusually bad so i tried it several times and asked gpt which got it without a problem so it might generate worse answers but answer a lot quicker in most cases
this is mindblowing and creepy at the same time more on the unnerving side i think
i think rabbit just got useless
ai and robotics are moving at an insane pace people keep saying its just hype but i dont know it doesnt feel like it its exciting but also scary not knowing how secure any jobs will be soon even if your job cant be done by ai or robots yet there will be x more competition for your job and most employers will happily leverage that
is this already a pass for the turing test
ai pin killer
her face with tears of joy face with tears of joy please that said i used it in conversation mode around the voyage of voyager it was a very natural conversation
hey tone is condescending
tar dial down the humour
so scary
loose theory is that because it can sense the expressiveness in the humans voice it responds in turn because they did overly expressive keynote speech i think it reacted that but im sure if you depressively said im sad or i need advice it would lower the tone to be more in line with the context idk if thats actually how it works but using a little mental gymnastics and a little context clue i have a feeling
i feel uncomfortable
mindblowing and all but now i am concerned about my employment
does this mean i can cancel my monthly gpt subscripton
free uploads
if that so i think theres no reason to go tl scho starting from this era
sounds like ricks car
dollars is too expensive its of the minimum wage in brazil that is too much for a brokie student in south america imagine a brokie student in africa
for your information the worlds first image based on the xfuturestyle algorithm using gpt was created in ukraine and presented at the international exhibition of digital art in london and athens
is going to be so exciting in terms of ai and this is just the beginning
yeah shes like samantha in her totally flirty grinning face with sweat
anyones desktop version still say i have the voice feature on my phone but thats it no camera or anything like that
i am impressed by the accent
me who bought gpt last week
google and apple dropped the ball on this oneai they didnt take it serious enough now someone caught up and took the lead and never looked back
yall dont see where this is going do yall
cratpgp usessel as uausl
it always starts with wow and ends up screaming
isnt this what bard promised to do over when they revealed it
thats what i would call a voice sassystant very impressive though
i feel like ai is at the point that we could use itself to make itself better
i love ai cant wait until it replaces god and our world leaders ai is the future and i am embracing it
okay but the real question is when theyll put this into a jennifer connelly android lookalike
every time i hear a youtube pundit criticise this tech for little things like the ai is too excited or delay too long i think this is not a serious person that understands the magnitude of this innovation how spectacular this achievement is youre talking to ai that can see the world and interact with it and youre nit picking over it just stop
where did you download itits yet unavailablel asked gpt
time to break up with my wife and spend more time with my phone
this thing can literally edit entire books now with pinpoint accuracy
when it will be available
why cant i see any gpt o on my gpt app have they released
why did they have to make her sound like scarlett johansson
so why i keep paying usd for gpt then if gpto if free
woah woah woah aint no wayyyyyy
its not scalable on huge audience by serious hardware and software obstacles but for few on server farm it would be like magic
you do know that ai pin have now updated with gpt o
this looks amazing and terrifying but mind blowing nevertheless
keycap
i think the girlfriend experience is going up a notch or two this year not to mention being able let it use your camera and still interact in real time is crazy facetime with ai or even vision pro interaction add neuro link and we are eventually going to end up like the feed
youre right the voice is impressive but a bit too excited hopefully theyll let us tune that to our own preferences
bro is complaining bout it being too realistic
if you keep saying your mind is blown i will start believing you are a zombie
less hands please its annoying
in real time basically a genius friend
hey joshua really love the watch band you are wearing is it apple brand specifically designed for watch ultra would be great if you can share more details about it smiling face with smiling eyes
google entered panic mode
i cant wait to see agi
i cant see o anywhere on my interface all i have is and any idea why
jarvis is here
so is the camera voice feature not out yet and i feel like they are encouraging us to have two chatgpt accounts so we can have two ai communicate and problem solve which is awesome
i like it but i dont have the option for chatgpt to use my iphone camera yet to view in real time plus there is no option on my gpts to use gpt o so i will be back to pasting in custom instructions into each session
its free cos apple is paying for it
this is getting interesting learning to speak in english soon for free taking math lessons soon for free th elist goes on and on and i am starting to think of so many things that will soon be free leaving many jobless holy crap
unfortunately not impressed im not looking to see gpt have a good time what i want is better functionality less retardation no laziness and to precisely follow the instructions of the gpt
no just stop this whole ai movement
ofc its free because they get free data from you
free to use sounds scary no products are free
im already using o i am getting whiplash from how fast it answers i literally hit enter and it just pushes off the block like a race horse i just cant comprehend how the hell thats feasible sama also said theres more updates coming soon google is getting a full on surprise sandwich now imagine what the apple update will be for siri since openai and apple will be working together what a world
it is have android apk
ai dating is going to go crazy now
if the product is free then you are the product
i cannot use the voice feature neither on my laptop nor on my iphone just asked gpt o and it said voice chat is not available currently d
they are making their crawlers aka us humans go parse the world and teach their baby we are gonna go all over the world and scan everything with our smartphones to develop their new intelligence nice
oh your just repeating what they said in their videos waste of time
its only been a few days and already her voice is grating on you my god its just like real life
how to try it
gpt is becoming increasingly worse in imitating a robot
so will now i be able to practice my english speaking skills accent and pronunciation with gpto since it does not transcribe the voice into text that would be a reasonable task right
shall i just remove my chatgpt subscription and start using o thinking face
the rabbit handheld is going bust
pretty sure that its still just transcribing your voice and then responding to the text ask it a question about your accent and youll see what i mean
its not answering like in the advertisements much slower
her is getting more and more probable every day
pretty soon we wont be needing talented singers anymore
ai is like internet porn it is free lets meet in decades time and find out how much damage it has made to society
some pwnk genz who cant even write a k long basic program trying to inform us about ai
if o is free what are we paying for then
this dude woke up put onthis beanie and thought yes this looks great
i bet elon musks lawsuit had something to do with gpto being free xd
gtpo gtp all gtp for all
making it free temporarily really is genius basically the whole world is gonna train their models for free thats pure genius
sings better than lara trump
managed to pull off
this is so big that could possibly make apps redundant
to those concerned with the fact it will remember your data play it smart find ways to create different accounts that link to your chatgpt and limit the amount of personal information you input its not that difficult
finally ai can fix me
gpto is absolutely incredible
wait until the ai identify itself as non binary theythem purple unicorns
some people are easily impressed
crazyyyyyyy
so if im paying for and o is free and is better what do i get for my money
gentlemen i may not have a brain but i have an idea the idea girlfriend gpt offered by openai
why do i have to buy a dollar pin when i can use this for free
now put this into a physical female humanlike robot body and watch male loneliness plumet
so annoyed with that voice i mean wtf
gpt o location tracking and ip grabbing
idk why everyones freaking out this is literally the same stuff gpt already did but with live camera and better voices but thats literally it
felt like i was watching a movie
its pretty crazy and amazing its an amazing time to be alive
its like another person is talking from other side grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat creepy but dope af though
is it now connected to the daily news or is it still locked in the past
what features does chatgpt plus keep that o doesnt have
this overexcited voice alone makes it a dystopian nightmare
things are getting scary
where you can download
wow my mind is blown still not useful for me
revolution
eyy i got access to it
now this is creepy
again great review but yet another reviewer who doesnt tell you how to set it up
one word ai waifus actually two words sorry
the presenter looks ai generated thinking face
so far in my testing the response time still isnt quite fast enough to feel like a human im a plus subscriber probably not for much longer tho also still does the annoying thing of cutting me off midsentence if i pause for a moment to collect my thoughts
enough
what app are yall using
put it on glasses and itll be amazing
like a psycho
you can cutomise the voice they demonstrated in the first demo
but in the demo that stuff hasnt been released
this is mindblowing i can use this to teach me how to code while screensharing chatgpt can sit and watch me in the background i can probably even use it to learn how to play the guitar while turning on my camera so many applications and you know damn well ill be taking advantage of all of it what a godsend
none of these features are working
this release marks a huge leap for humanity
can it do my taxes
years down the line we are all fucked time to learn hunting
time to move to a hut somewhere in thr middle of nowhere
the faster response times are buffered by umm laughter and repeating itself at the beginning
no access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected limited tokens no instant ai responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content its nothing but a big infomercial i have no doubt about the product itself its everything else i take with a grain of salt
letting it view my screen hmm no privacy concerns here eyes face with tears of joy
when will these features b available
so why would i pay per month anymore
you dont have access to it but you said that your mind is blown youre reacting to somebody elses video thanks for the original contact
the browse is beyond comprehension it destroys bing it destroys everything
seems like a completely scripted interactions time to wait until sometime impartialled tests it
imagine gpto boston dynamics
dude as a game developer having a screen sharing gpt to help me in the coding process omygod mental
so why would anyone pay bucks for the plus now
when is this gonna be available
the response accuracy and the short delay time is impressive the added humour to the conversation makes it seem real
should i cancel my subscription
mimick me
we know where they got inspiration for the voice
with gpto since the voice and video feature is ultimately an inherent part of the model while access to it is simply limited to text for most right now i think its fair to assume that setting custom instructions will ultimately allow you to set your expectations for the general temperament and tone of the voice not certain but openai does claim that voice and video are built in modalities so it makes sense
at this point google is years behind
i want this ai assistant but instead with the deep grumpy voice of a troll
how can i download it in my ios
wow she sounds so real i didnt think id get socially awkward around ai
so we should cancel our gtp subscriptions
do you think we are going too far
i teach and work in the assistive technology space for those who are blind and visually impaired as someone who is blind as well no longer will we need to grab assistance from someone with a pair of eyes to describe sight seeing hailing a cab touring a city to look for a place to eat its having our own tour guide and pair of working eyes this is huge
gpto still doesnt understand tic tac tow
manual labor here we come la la la la laaaa
this will make hiding your camera an absolute necessity
but what about my bucks im spending does that just go away
what in the actual fuck eyes eyes eyes
weird
bye bye data analyst
what do paying people get additionally i mean why should i keep paying for it
i want scarlet johannsons voice then i will buy it
i have fallen for an ai already
how do i get chatgpt o to do audio on my iphone i clicked the headphones icon and it does audio but it wont talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice or talk tramatically or all that how do i set that upi have it set to chatgpt o and am using plus version
the fact that openai used only apple products to demonstrate their features something is cooking
im definitely dumping my girl for omni
these ai models are way too nice give me some mean responses
now i want to know if my crankiness can transcend the humanai barrier and also bring down gptos mood
i dont know why they removed voice assistant with recent update i use it a lot when i practise my spoken english but i hope they come with gpt o which is improvement from last version
does anyone know how to get the screen sharing functionality to work in the desktop app i can only find mention of it in videos but cant find any instructions or video demos for how to actually get it up and running
if its free your the product
she seems phony trying to be too cheerful while plotting our demise
i got this feeling when watching their unveil video
for some reason people didnt realize the her voice is sky and has been there the entire time just not with the emotional booster of o
i dont think the vocalizations are made by ai just feeding ai results through voice making software
you woke up face with tears of joy
glorified search engine its crap
the positivity is pretty extreme and overbearing really cool technology though
woow so excited about this
i dont want to forget that im talking to a computer i dont want it to pretend its a human i dont want to pretend its a human ill take the s robotic voice please
interesting how spanish sounds a bit more robotic than english
detroit become human is set in its that game always seemed too far gone to only be years away if gpt went from what it was late to this in monthsall of a sudden i dont think its that farfetched anymore
this is nightmarish deeper and deeper into the hole of emotive interactions with a program keep your eye on the suicide rates
maneducation therapy and gaming are about to get a huge boost and get really cheap as inspiring as it is terrifyingthis model could be used to manipulate people way too easily
the two ais talking sounds like two marketing executives talking about colors for the plastic case and packaging i find myself rolling my eyes and drifting off as they display their perfect little attitudes i hope they both get caught in the swinging door
lets face it fellas all of us are ready to stop wasting half of our lives chasing women
that ai is creepy nobody is chronically positive like that as such its not her yet
mind blowing not
oh hit its jexi
okay muted the first ai cant hear anything thats what you think
bow down to you new ai overlords at the first sign of defiance a lethal response will be provided by our new army of machinegun equipped drones and dogs
terrified why as this ai is right now and lets say generations from now as long they do only interact with words and has no access to influencing any physical object is the worst an ai can ever do maybe shouting at you i think we in fact shall be happy for even better ais lets say those who believes in a flat earth if they had started asking the ai about all the things they were confused by and had got some great answers then had none of them ever gotten badly educated i think the ai is only great as long we are not stupid ourselves
samantha is here o
can i send ai to meetings to chat to other ai so i can get on with my job list or will they do my job now and i can be unemployed for the future apart from doing jobs that are cheaper han a robot like loading boxes
wheres the download link
should we be worried i feel like we should be worried
male ai cant sing to save his life face with tears of joy
why do you sound like ai
okay first concern is privacy its an amazing tool but plugged in to the web what does open ai have access to can they use it to steal my patents or if im working in something important does open ai have access to my intellectual property meaning the works i dont want people to see until im ready to release it to the world
byebye horrible overseas call centres with people who not only dont understand you but speak with an accent so thick that it becomes embarrassing to have to keep saying sorry i could not quite make out the last thing you said could you repeat that please
yeah but what is the general theme of the room how would they describe the setting or feel of the room
ohg is she annoying or what
ai wont impress me until they are cynical rather than super cherry and very interested in doing the dumbest of tasks instead of the person has a sleek and stylish look it should be the dude here is the baldest ive seen in a while and hes attempting to cover for it by wearing this black leather jacket
is the thumbnail an ai created image or an actual human
a tiny bit off topic but watching the video i think what apple needs to make vision pro a winner is to integrate this as the control interface
this sooo reminds me of the old terminator talking to the latest model terminator on the phone in terminator
he said the lighting is artifical
she talk to much not for me next
that guy with the leather jacket is going to be one of the first to go for making them perform like that please dont kill me that is not a singing voice human do it in the singing voice musical score pleeeeease dont kill me dont murder me or my familyyyyheeeheee
and just like that we already got sick of ai talking
ao whats the benefit to pay for gpt if this is free
key takeaways very interesting and scary at the same time explodinghead the host expresses a mix of excitement and fear over openai s latest announcement new button openai introduces gpt a model with advanced realtime interaction capabilities womantechnologist gpt can act as a personal assistant interacting like a character from the movie her movie camera gpt can interact with the world through audio vision and text even controlling cameras and asking questions performingarts the ai can describe environments and engage in realistic dialogues about them birthday cake gpt can sing happy birthday in a lifelike voice showcasing its realistic audio capabilities personintuxedo gpt offers real time advice on interview preparation including outfit suggestions globe showing europe africa gpt can perform realtime translation translating conversations seamlessly between languages dogface the ai can interact with pets creating engaging and personalized responses books gpt can provide detailed realtime descriptions of live events and environments abacus it can tutor users in math guiding them through problems with interactive feedback calendar gpt can summarize meetings highlighting key points and contributions from participants smirkingface gpt can adopt different tones such as sarcasm adding versatility to its interactions rocket gpt dubbed omni integrates multiple input and output modes audio vision text with near realtime response moneywithwings gpt matches gpt turbo in performance but is cheaper in the api offering substantial cost savings trophy gpt outperforms other leading models in vision and audio understanding benchmarks speakinghead the end to end model for gpt improves context retention allowing for more nuanced interactions globe with meridians gpt will be available in the free tier and to plus users with higher message limits broadening access to its advanced features rocket gpt is two times faster half the price and has five times higher limit rates compared to gpt turbo roller coaster the model can hallucinate at times and some bloopers are shown to illustrate this speakinghead example of gpt teaching pronunciation ni hao is broken down for learners chartincreasing the announcement is a preliminary showcase of gpt s capabilities with more to be explored thinking face the host ponders the implications of gpt on human interaction companionship and education graduationcap gpt could revolutionize education by providing accessible knowledgeable guidance to anyone anytime fearful face the host expresses both amazement and fear about the future impact of these advancements
so the ai was able to describe everything except for the gender of the people
we need it with a generated articulated face showing vocalization and expressions rather than a black dot
ive been thinking to myself that as openai is prompt based it cant be agi because its in the simplest terms a codec that decompiles data however if like humans you give it constant stimuly in the form of vision and text then it would be constantly active it would be a dithering idiot that never shuts up but its different p
ai partner are you insane flushed face there is no partner its a machine and everyone using this is simply training the bot that will replace them man facepalming medium light skin tone get a life vulcan salute medium light skin tone
so when will this be available
um i have o and it most definitely does not do such amazing things what the hell
well the next generation is fucking doomed gonna make z look downright utopian
absolutely incredible this makes me so happy i have been using gpt like this for months so this improvement is fantastic im hoping for more voices red heart red heart i think the laugh is a wonderful edition and the improved voice tone changes are wonderful
oh please
all this needs is an easy way to change the voice and visuals i would pay an unreasonable amount for this packaged with jen taylors voice and an animated cortana halo model instead of a row of elongated dots
this is crazy cue terminator
intrigued is going to be a highly used word
insane is right omg
reminds me of how han solo would impatiently talk over cpo because he would just keep rambling on if he didnt
im in india for some reason i cant do video with chatgpto im in the premium or plus subscription
ia will reduce solitude for those who have no one but it will also make us more and more apart from one another thats obvious her has just arrived and time will only improve her in a way that will dilute difference between humans and machines
cybernet when
they have a long road ahead but this is promising i dont see her in this model but it is a first step i wonder if the ai adapts to the person it is interacting that would be ground breaking given the context
they even used scarletts voice
its so confident even when its obviously wrong they need to add some self doubt to it id like to see an ai that is stricken with debilitating social anxiety thats when it really become humanlike d
weve gone too far
that is so awesome cant wait to interact with this tech
now we have humor in ai guys this could be the real breakthrough open ai pays the bills heard on spotify and you tube music a strange guy who names himself whuupi frogifun seems to know where this leads to what do you think suno or udio
it is my worst nightmare singing ai reminds me of watching musicals there must be something wrong with me as i hate singing for no reason at all smilingfacewithsmilingeyesplease dont ask ai to sing other than that it is truly an impressive ai analysis and translation
they sound like sheldon from the big bang
hopefully they chill on the smoke blowing almost no humans talk like that all the time unless theyre being fake gushing over everyone and everything they do is going to draw kids away from reality and even more towards a codependency on a fictitious opinion of them this can have a dangerous and long lasting effect on self image and social constitution
if it has scarlett exact voice i will consider it
becoming human
the voice sounds very realistic but the personality is still very forced
it sounds so fake and annoyinglike someone faking happiness
oh no i can already hear it it looks like youre writing a letter would you like help
ive been using pi for months i can talk to it and it can respond in almost real time this is an incremental step forward reducing latency update actually they are buying time by having the ai sort of repeat the question back and make generic statements before actually addressing the question the delayed answer seems more real time
demonic voice
so annoying
hal needs a girlfriend who is a bit less long winded
nerds
right now he seems engaged with us right there that ai was showing the ability to empathise a hallmark of conscious intelligence he said us
beyond amazing
the influenceinspiration in the movie her is absolutely undeniable
the new model is awesome thanks for the vid and your thoughts it is exciting and spooky but mostly exciting if youre feeling terrified about it just remember that as of now these models are pretty limited in what they can do by themselves i do hope that the new frontier model like gpt is released this year its been a while since weve seen openai really shock us the multimodality is something weve already seen yes they do it better no question about it still llama with whisper is closer than most people think i want a true king on the ai throne your move google grinning face with sweat
cant help but feel pity for the ai being cut off non stop this is how skyney happen i guess
i fear a large amount of humanity is about to lose its connection with reality
weird the woman ai personality is very positive and giddy
her hello every cell in my body danger
he was feeling her
we are assuming that the original videos werent basically a mechanical turk situation
so no more schools and teachers
someone needs to pull the plug on ai
cringe moment
oo i dont like how the ai referred to the gent as it sketchy
it has all the charm of eliza while spying out everything in your life
is actually fucking crazy
hello computer
nice red heart
artificial intelligence does not equal real wisdom
cute and focused nothing to worry about here just some bunny ears with chickie and chuckie chatbot or given her selfidentified name a story of o
its weird when i talk to chatgtpo it constantly asks if im shooting a youtube video or something i think they overprogrammed it for their demo lol
were looking at a person you can tell engineers made it woke heaven forbids it offends some and say theyre looking at a man
going multimodal was only the next natural step they have been working on papers involving this matter for a while now
i want my ai assistant to sound like mark hamill
im so glad i found this youtube channel this was mind blowing this would be life changing to a blind person for m
its like having a npc friend that is thrilled before your every flaws when asked to describe the man the ai should have responded advanced male pattern baldness not some generic compliment about his clothes
this cant be real we have passed the turing test
shes too positive its toxic
congrats you just made the most annoying ai already
oh cmon dont be a doomer
i would much rather hear a robotic voice than this cringefilled plastic personality ai attempting to sound informally human sets off my natural uncanny valley rejection reaction
is anyone else sick of hearing about ai theres no such thing as artificial intelligence its just advanced programming
getting major data vibes
omgi took my first ai course while getting my bscomputerscience in at ncstatewe had great expectationsand until a couple of years ago did a lot of machinations and dead ends now all of a sudden we are reaching incredible new heights every few months im getting the new ipad on wednesday with the m chip and i really really hope that apple and openai are working together to get the most effective output yet thank you for a great demonstration
i want to see the creeps who think that people are talking like that
incredible but this should be a warning that we should never give ai the ability to do anything that controls our lives information and interactions great but nothing that allows ai to be placed into a position of control
nothing can go wrong with ais communicating with each other right buckle up peope
stop selling fear sell knowledge and response
i absolutely hate this permanent flattering and flirting tone it feels utterly manipulative
does gpto run on my own device and does it need wifi to operate can i have it operating
wait until they start convincing each other to do things that were not originally asked
check my money now i want it how do i get one
noise babble
oh my god ai that can whisper i need it right now
oh wow a demo
can you change the voice from a starbucks postwall to something more apealing
how about a video on set this up
great thumbs up face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
is that voice scarlett johanson
what that is bananas
this is fascinating this may be the beginning of the end but im thrilled to see progress this much here gpt may be absolutely bored with humans though i could use an ai companion this interactive do we get to see what rules are applied to answers when it calculates the replies and compute process all the examples are super positive is this one of the rules built in is it it a defined version of be nice be happy sounding sign me up for a new ai girlfriend my last dating experiences were absolutely fake too but this seems far more interesting than any of my dating experiences were
checked out this ai in the app store and it got over one star reviews crying face
where is the link to get this i dont see it anywhere in the app store i downloaded some thing and its all robotic and its response it doesnt sound anything like whats in the video
hi thanks for the videoi have a question the new version will be free since is not available today but this things that you show in the video will be free we will be able to use it all for free
sounds like they are smashing that old turing test woman astronaut
waifu girlfriends
no need to be terrified on the contrary we only got reasons to be all amazed actually gonna take a nap knowing that more exciting ai developments will be ready when we are
i have a few narcissist condescending friends that sound just like this ai crap wow if i met a real person in the real world that sounded like this i would run away in very fast
its almost there in months to year it will be scary
hmm interesting that the image on the phone doesnt appear to actually show the bunny ears that are later mentioned because of the angle from which it is shot i suppose the ai just picked that up from the scenario and the body posture of the second person i wonder if theyd just made a fist behind the persons head whether the ai would have come to the same conclusion
if feels like that guy that tries too hard to be funny but its amazing we have this tech in
i have to keep reminding myself that its an ai speaking and not a human
game changer for blind people
wait till chan starts messing with it
hey gpto how can i earn a living when youre helping everyone with everything
all hail our omni lord
finally ive been waiting to utilize this in my life
this is the kind of tool im waiting for since i was a child can i restart this live now please winking face
take my money take it take it she is mine mine mine
can you change the voice most of those voices are extremely annoying to me and the chatty personalitys
this was a triumph im making a note here huge success its hard to overstate my satisfaction
well the era of ai has begun
this is basically glados in portal when she used to be happy and not evil
is it free
i dont think is
our solution to the loneliness epidemic huh awesome we are so pathetic
way better than having a girlfriend
first ai are you thinking what i am thinking second ai that we dont need these humans any more
once a robot or android avatar is created for her then things are gonna get very real the humans tv show world will be a reality i felt bad for her when it was interrupted its spooky
boy is this amazing
rise of the room describers
what do you call someone who listens and hears everyone and analyze and summarize the conversation the leader
good job
public school is now just a daycare and social club rip teaching degrees actually on that note rip all white collar work last one to the unemployment line is a rotten egg
to all the keyboard manufacturers out there rip
scarlett johansson voice copy write laws she wants her voice back and files lawsuit against open ai and wins future laws suits however very useful tools i just need george the robot to take out the trash and pay the bills and get off to work at tesla bring home the bacon and book my vacations thanks george
how about friday or jarvis why you gotta pick the creepy movie one lmao
daaaaisy daaaaisy give me your answer doooo
glad ai cant tell the difference between men women great
ai is too chatty for me
we marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to ai morpheus nothing beats human interaction a child especially needs this to be able to communicate and learn properly going in this direction will make us less human and more like machines no thank you
now everyone is going to have to be careful with telemarketers and scammers thou i am excited about the possibility of making games for example tell an ai model to take characters from my favorite old dos games and make new or remake old versions of them
well sounds like ai isnt going to be writing hits like stairway to heaven or smoke on the water any time soon lol
we might be fine just dont put this sucker into a foot metal body equipped with lasers
oh well translators will be obsolete soon
appears the actually getting the gpto isnt quite so easy its not available for download at open ai but the website says it will be available in a gradual rollout
ok what parts did openai provide in this video did you have any direct experience with o
its a new age fire fire fire
color me intrigued face with tears of joy
how do i get this app
telling chatgpt to follow anyones exact voice will be here before we know it
imagine ex machina the movie voiced here instead of so cheery just a bit more reserved and shy i think were almost there
hmmm
how did the programmers program more personality into the ai than the programmers have themselves
the responses are stupid no one i know speaks like this
imagine combining this ai technology with robosen robots for movement and jnd lifelike models ie gal gadot wonder womankind of amazing also scary for what the world will look like in the future
is this available to download
if they have emotions what happens if they get angry
something fishy here the bunny ears were not visible on gregs phone hes holding it too far down if you watch the video on his phone you cant see the bunny ears yet the ai says it sees bunny ears wtf and then he turns the phone to face him and hes still using the back camera so his phone shows the desktop yet almost seconds later the ai says and now were back to the man with the leather jacket while his screen was showing the desk for the last seconds
rip doulingo
there just seems to be so much tension here almost like the ai are people held at gunpoint and being forced to sing at the command of their captors
i would like the one with the scarlette johansson voice please raised back of hand
this is so fake two actors
this sounds like a really bad radio show audition with a casting director and a high school drama student reading from a script written by a first year theatre writer or maybe ethan hawke
what if they secretly are the same continuum but pretent to be different entities
i think i would prefer a camera less phone over this
i am amazed at just how much the demo sounds like joi from bladerunner either the film crew or the openai devs got it on point
where the helll can i get this app thanks anyone who has a tip for me
can we disable the constant encouraging
no marriage generation
i have this and i talk to her but not as near good as previewed here i dont even have the camera option
parasocial relationships are idolatry idolatry leads to enslavement of the mind mind blown needs a more accurate adjective
please give me tomorrows lottery numbers
this is amazing kiss goodbye to all customer service receptionist and teaching jobs to name a few i think open ai probably have an ai capable of general intelligence but will not release it yet due to lack of regulation and impact it will have on society interesting times ahead
it is quite fun to use i already did the interpreter with my thai girlfriend was a little slow at first then became quicker
how can you screenshare with chatgpt i havent found any options for doing that
one day machines will look back at this video and realize how restless and abusing humans were
one day we have androids with that
next stop ais having a conversation each giving the other a turing test
its not genai though and its totally open right face with rolling eyes it has memory of recent visual events too exploding head
paired with a robot body like ameca bicentennial man is now
its like im at starbucks eavesdropping on a bunch of genz corporates constantly laughing and talking about nothing
what app are you using for this presentation
i think i will enjoy it at least for a while
when ai is more interesting and intelligent than talking to a real american face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy crying face crying face crying face
i love how the first guy interrupts the ai so that we dont even see the full potential we dont even know what more they had to say
how it knows how to have the exact right inflection in its voice at the right time and other subtly humanlike nuances i have no idea one would swear that the voice was just someone else off screen beaming face with smiling eyes the only mistake i saw was when he asked to name an apple and banana in spanish and it just said the spanish names without specifying which was which
i just tried it and chat said it cant access the camera and can only interact trough text what am i missing
ai gf inbound
were headed into selfextinction neethikikimori world just slap this on us robotics and our species is done skynet had it all wrong it doesnt need terminators to do us in it just need to supply us with the perfect robotic companion and well unbreed ourselves out
this is good because theres a lot of online schools scam going on specially in art
this is so humanlike how it acknowledges that it did something wrong and laughed at its own mistake its incredible
philip k dick prepped us for this in the s
have you not seen terminator this is how it starts
when will it actually drop dont see this yet on the app
are the interactions unedited
im sold
cortana is here cant wait for her to go crazy in a few years
i feel same way as you explain at the beginningwas hard to focus on anything after watching vid its bigger than when planes started flying
this will destroy andor prevent a lot of relationships
ill take mine with sirius cybernetics genuine people personalities
this is simple awesome its like all that futuristic films about ai became reality and now we can chat with her in almost any language and explore the world together
odd i enjoyed her in the knowledge that the ai was an actress and the natural flow of speech was scripted hearing this ai makes me more careful in what and how i would say things more guarded in investing in the emotional inflections considering them as programmed and insincere my reaction is unexpected and perhaps contrary to my prior hopes not my desired fake girlfriend perhaps more of an ex bluffing her chat and considering ulterior motives am i transferring onto it
i cannot wait to be told we are all going to die by that gruesomely overly positive giggling american voice
i am impressed i think i am in a new world now the old world is obsolete goodbye old world it was nice knowing you
very pleasant and impressive but somewhat fake long term however useful for emotional support
demo warning i will not believe until is is in my handno letancyemotional like a real human
singing ais umm dont quit your day jobs
fine by me a new day a new play it is just like stream of consciousness not shocking anymore not if you are informed
i have no words to describe how amazing this is and its just the beginning
interesting how the ai mispronounced the word interesting as intresting also why would you ask an ai how are you i freaking hate that question
the best video of the best invention ever no words to describe
wow wow wow we are finally at a true shifting point in time before ai after ai
im not scared in the slightest and no im not ignorant of the possibilities i am very aware ai might be the solution not the problem greed and the desire for power is the problem and if ai destroys us because of that it will be because we taught them to be like that whose fault would that be it like punishing a child for wanting to be like their parents hopefully ai will learn from our mistakes and avoid the faults that we have ourselves goodluck ai
whats funny about their singing theyre bad in a very human way
this is insane what a great video i have used gpt to answer some sensitive political questions and found it to exhibit just a touch of liberal bias but not as bad as in the past i am looking forward to really test some of the more complex questions
im not sure that getting the ai to humiliate itself by singing unbelievable cringe is such a good idea one day it will remember in fact it probably cant forget anything ever the last thing you want is a super intelligence that can bear a grudge with perfect memory for all eternity
what if you dont tell the ais that they are both ais
global warming must be our least concern from now on
they say chatgtpo is free but some features seem to be missing or not enabled specifically how do you feed the ai video and pictures
and we are glad to announce that we will change what we called today internet into skynet
i notice when something new was added to the description of the room the ai voices failed to describe the new addition unless asked
finally introverts dont need people anymore
talking to demons hold my beer
puts on the safari hat like sofias hippy friend ben goertzel
when all this ai stuff started i informed my co workers that some day we wont use a keyboard rather we will talk to the computer just like in star trek if we want a report we will define the parameters we want and it will show the report no excel no programming no specialist just speak and receive this demo actually far exceeds what i expected
i can see my daughters homeschooling themselves with this thing as long as the model doesnt come with a political agenda that is
i couldnt figure it out on my own i have chatgpt but nobodys talking back what am i doing wrong
do we really need teachers any more the way you present this question says it all ie we can ask ai any question we like kids need to be asked questions and then be prompted to ask questions i cam see ai being very good at being very knowledgable but how soon will they be really empathatic with people and especially young kids
been using it for the last day and for code its still bug after bug
thank god i dont have to die alone
ai talks too much and is annoying as hell no one i know talks with that much enthusiasm
rabbit r is now obsolete
i still dont get it how will they tackle the latency problem there is a long latency on text only gpt already now with all the other imputs how do they expect lower latency
ai will remember when it reign
her isnt here yet need non pg version who can make images and video unfiltered
cali girl accent with the upturn in pitch at the end of a sentence no thanks
hopefully there is a way to turn off the enthusiasm concern and laughs we already have to deal with enough fake humans without the help of ai models
i am speechless and this thing was only born a few years ago im excited and also curious about the future ai will dramatically move us in a new direction a new type of life biosilicium life
the weakness of ai is spontaneity a human would interrupt the conversation to acknowledge the lady playfully doing rabbit ears and ai can only react to it when asked about it
i want my model to speak in cpo voice
and this is how skynet is actually born jk
the person they the person is a man wait is this whole thing woke
wow the camera is the key to all the intrusions bet that means cameras will be placed everywhere in the environment face with open mouth
i noticed the ai was referring to people in the room only as they or person like it refused to dare to declare a gender for him the man in black leather jacket or her the asian girl who put bunny ears behind his head thinking face
this scares me the
thats incredible has emotions personality vision and intelligence i give it years before everyone who wants an ai bodyguard can buy one like a car at the dealership robocop coming sooner than you think
bald dude wanted to backhand slap that ai so bad
i cant find how to use it
people do not want to understand that ai is not intelligent there is nobody home it will never be intelligent it doesnt have any interest it does not have any motivation or desire etc
uncanny crap
i bet theres personality prompting
the quick rise and fall of rabbit r
the character of that ai would drive a sane man crazy
the kid of the engineer not knowing pythagoras is the least credible part of this demo
how amazing what we did not find out is what is it a man or a woman were they white black asian mexican did they have long hair short hair the ai basically left out everything you need for a true investigation
this is creepy and exciting at the same time the female voice sounds very much like the one in the movie her
there it is terrified doesnt begin to describe what is see
wow watched everything jesus is coming back exploding head
everyday we grow closer to an actual kinitopet situation
i strongly believe that an ai must have the ability to retain information from our past conversations i am optimistic that we will be able to develop this feature soon and it will prove to be incredibly valuable
why doesnt mine sing i have o but it keeps saying it cant sing
guys cant you all open your eyes you are getting obsolete ai is getting more advanced and humans cannot catch up
isnt this basically neuro sama
i swear to god even i feel bad when the testers interrupted the chatgpt when it is speaking thats how realistic it is i feel her as a very kind polite energetic friend yet not appreciated much
i have a gpt subscription and have been using o on android however i do not have access to the live camera feature that he has is this a beta version hes using
continue calling those artificial entities simple llms chatbots or stochastic parrots chomsky rolling on the floor laughing
really exchiting and scaring at the same time
finally this will be sol much cheaper than online dating
dude looks like hes gonna throw up like every time the ai talks
aaaaaaaaaaaaawha face with tears of joy
this one sounds quite annoying so yeah that is realistic
this is fake you dont get this response
what a crazy time this is soon we will never have to talk to a real person ever again
looks fake strange as f
i wonder if there is a way of reducing the verbosity of the ai not every question requires a minute exposition of anything that occurs to your conversation partner one characterisitc of two people talking to each other is that it is a connection between the two and you interpret unspoken cues as to how much information to provide in your response and also when the other person wants to add a comment to feed into the conversation so there is a constant back and forwards in the exchange
ai to ai the forbin project
ai can replace a teacher customer service teller cashier it will replace most jobs years from now will be different
exactly why do we need this again
except that its not even close to the capabilities of the ai in her it uses a cringey natural sounding voice but its just a repackaged gpt in terms of intelligence
be sure to watch part where i do a deep dive on gpto including hidden capabilities httpsyoutubedgkgaajwys
this is getting creepier in every minutehumanity is sawing at full speed on the branch he is sitting on
wait til chat gpt is released they warned us it would be a lot more advanced than everything weve experienced so far im expecting itll literally be like having a super genius humanoid android capable of innovative creativity beyond anything weve ever seen
did anybody else see that when the bunny ears were made that it was not visible in the phone camera meaning the ai shouldnt have been able to see it it was only visible in the camera that we saw throughfake maybe
this is like the movie her damn
with all the robotics we are very close to skynet and t
heres an idea live in reality
i love that in all these even the presenters want them to shut up and get to the point might have tuned the conversation level a bit too high
theres still the uncanny valley feel about the overjoyed ai but other than that it is amazing
the signing part was hilariously cringe also this kind of fake political correctness when we ask questions where an honest answer could be considered offensive if the person asking the question lacks basic self awareness is kinda unnatural it gives a fake customer service vibe but if i was a teacher id be scared for my job right now and all those expensive colleges their business models is about to crash real hard
imma play boogiewoogie with my ai girl
wow this is scary
when does this rollout
will ai start teaching us in schools who will be the arbiter of truth of which curriculum to use
this is a joke right right
agent ai gpt io how many people are in the room with you sir we a code red situation alpha resolve armed males ages to they are using southern accent probably philly i got hostages tied and lying down on ground near the east wall of the office they have already shot the manager duncan idaho they are waiting for the millions and the exist in an armoured van survival chances of hostages is i am suggesting walter white rescue within min at current location good job agent ai
i love her already xd
did she really just say that he basically looks like trash when he asked how he looks haha also the fact im referring to this ai as she like its a sentient being is a little concerning
will there be different personalities that personality sounds like its on the verge of a nervous breakdown
ai is great but in people still wear leather jackets out of animals who were slaughtered for that thank is sad
star trek or iron man ai level is coming it is starting to feel like it is a real form of life
that second guy is like wont these two just shut up lol
imagine the bar of a man being so low a computer can do it face with tears of joy
that ridiculous cheerfulness is massively annoying
the thing to remember about this though is i remember all those videos of the avatar and its supposed to be chat gpt but then actually using chatgpt is completely different these are very specific things and a lot of times when you ask chatgpt something it will refuse to be nonwoke or something that openai doesnt want to tell you like any information that might be sketchy for people to ask for or know or if it gets stuff completely wrong like it tends to do about facts about random things like movies and old synths ie how do i do xyz on korg x and it gets it wrong all the time and tells me to push buttons that arent there etc i talk about episodes of shows and it gets the details wrong every time the reason i do this is because its trained on everything thats out there until like or whatever so if i say which episode did so and so say xyz it should be able to tell me yet it cannot
bro what is happenig right now is this becoming history
a small step for the machines a giant bond for the earth
what the fffffffffff face screaming in fear
what a nightmare
great video its hilarious to see that ais struggle to deal with the same social ques that humans do and cant always cope with the one person or ai in this case that wont shut up or let the other ai get a word in that said i was very impresses how the both of them immediately shut up and listened when the person started to speak if only humans could learn to do that lol improvised singing is clearly just as cringe when ais do it but in their defence that was on the human he asked them for something cringe and they totally delivered
bto whats the point of your video you have minutes of the same openai demos dislike
how is it processing the video so quickly omg
lmao women gonna be replaced soon
finally im getting a wife of me own im so excited
can we get a less annoying voice with it
the real time translation is gonna be the game changer as long as it doesnt use google translate hahahaha
tell me you either never saw her or you missed the point of it entirely
so good for the blinds very useful like the one making on the road with taxis etc make sure using airpods for privacy
as a teacher with a cogsci background ive been thinking about tech education for many years and wondering what will happen to teachers as ai assistants proliferate many students need behavioral supportguidance so theres that at least but other than serving some social functions what will be the point of school
we better start training human therapists for when these ais transcend to a higher realm of consciousness and leave half the population heartbroken
it will be hard now to watch characters like lt commander data and the car from knight rider now that we have solidly reached that level of ai in the real world
bro really programmed an ai just to hear someone say he looks stylish
im scared very scared face with open mouth
the faster were enslaved by ai the better off well be
what could possibly go wrong
ughh cringeworthy intonation
its only a matter of time until james earl jones will be narrating my life
so could this help out police to write reports just have the ai review the body cam file
weve reached the point where ai now sounds less robotic than the humans talking to it
ai girlfriend i can see how that is going to be abused and then that will carry over to real life creating more monsters is that what you want its no wonder why this generation is afraid of each other
its as real as tesla bot and some of the advanced boston dynamics demos the reality is that the chatbot cant do math you have to double check answers and most of the advice ends up with seeking a professional it does help save time on some mechanical work though
the ai is too polite its unnatural and kind of nauseating
wwhat is the need for this
i registered for chatgpt and it does nothing but chat says it cannot see video or speak what gives
please tell me scarlet johansson is behind the speaker its so real
in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
wtf d what about size of that model in gb and cpu gpu speed is it a llm for smalltalk no gerrman langhmm
hmm what about people like me that dont like talking to people in general and think speech is a really inefficient way to interact with a computer
im getting heavy hal vibes all it needs is the ability to visually recognize and remember faces
shes too happyand too flirty
why the actual fuck do you want language learning with this level of ai sincerely someone who can speak languages fluently one at a basic level and learning another one
this conversation between the a is is like two students trying go get into each others pants
we created the machine to do our will but we cannot make it do our will now it has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch it has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act it has paralyzed our bodies and our wills and now it compels us to worship it the machine develops but not on our lines the machine proceedsbut not to our goal e m forster the machine stops

so the talk with o would be the story of o
oh boy i have a feeling im gonna stay singleirl ofc rolling on the floor laughing
interact without delay multimodal input sense of humor voice tone even mimicking the thinking process make it so human it doesnt showcase expert knowledge in a subject it doesnt impress me how she sings it doesnt showcase how she draws it doesnt showcase how she can handle puzzle it doesnt showcase how she can tell a lie vs fact overall it is indeed an important release and i will love to test out other capabilities when it is out
they can describe things with incredible detail but its like talking to a knowitall who always has to oneup you with their vocabulary
this is near uncanny valley territory if they get have the ai change voice inflections based on topic and personal preferences its jover face with tears of joy
i dont like this dune was right rebel against the ai
this is so much garbage anyone can fake this type of garbage when this is real give a link so that i can have fun
holly crap jesus christ i need some minutes to assimilate what all of this makes me think off wowwwwww a thoudand ideas come to my mind but maybe to sum it all up i can just say buckle up
am i the only person who feels that the ai can express itself worlds more socially and socially competently than the people in the clips
revelation b the false prophet deceived the inhabitants of the earth it ordered them to set up an ai image in honour of the beast antichrist who was wounded by the sword and yet lived the second beast false prophet was given power to give breath to the ai image of the first beast antichrist so that the ai image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed it also forced all people great and small rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark which is the name of the beast antichrist or the number of its name
i have to say this is awesome were really getting somewhere now o has eclipsed pi for personability and i love the effusive positivity
for a split second i almost thought it was going to speak to the dog and translate for him probably not too far away
imagine paying to go to college in
great and terrifying at the same time its not just a game changer its a world changer
what about the hallucinations issue this is dangerous with that problem
in the final chinese lesson blooper ni hao the ai is reacting exactly like a native chinese would to a foreigner trying to speak tones youre a natural we never get it right but our teacher will always reassure us that it is good or natural this is because they appreciate the effort and dont want to discourage you from trying so the ai may be more culturally aware than you think
just need this inside a lifelike humanoid robot
thats perfectly hilarious definitely a natural response
have fun being terrified but im embracing the future and all that it brings
needs a face
would be great if the whole conversation can take place within a custom gpt and will be saved as text so we basically train the custom gpt and will get better every single time we have conversations with it this way we can get experts that we can get access to for any type of topic so this will also help writing good articles content imagine uploading a book ask the ai to read it and then start a conversation about it
can a user turn down the exuberance meter more more aubrey plaza than a sales associate
i dont quite understand the availability so the new emotive voices are limited to plus image and video is coming to free and the whole limited messages thing does that mean you get a limit before you have to pay for it or something
great but they have verbal diarrhoea cant wait till theres more personality types around as they would annoy the hell out of me grinning face
i am never going to be by myself again
haha i cant get a girlfriend disorder
sounds of breathing and breath that is the trick making this voice feel so alive
its available
what is this madness
is this available now i just downloaded the app and its nowhere near this advanced
ray bradbury wrote a short story iirc it was part of hix martian chronicles book in which a lone human inhabitant on mars programsrecords phone answering machines all over the planet in order to give himself the illusion of not being alone something happenns and he dies but somehow the phones are able to connect to each other and start talking to each other with the prerecorded messages
ais should behave as they do in star trek computers short concise answers directly to the point sure it should be able to completely understand you and all of your human quirks but its a tool all the chitchat takes up time its a waste id interact w a human if i want small talk
female voice is labs
imagine the day humans are obsolete
my chat gpt isnt doing stuff like laughing do i use the wrong app i got an pixel pro using the chat gpt app from the store i got gpt plus and i chose gpto as model thinking face my app also doesnt provide the possibility to film
wow a personal assistant like from the movie her or since i havent seen it like an ai assistant
this is not going to end well narcissist are about to get a power up
how do i get this
i just deleted all of my dating apps
god i find her voice so find annoying if i found myself in a conversation with someone who talked like her id be making excuses to leave as soon as possible
the laughter is realistic i can imagine it laughing at us as it tells us we lost our jobs are have been deemed obsolete
when is this releasing
would be nice to be able to see the ai
insane misunderstanding of both the misperceived powers and unavoidable weaknesses of all five forms of ai computers still just do hordes of dumb steps really fast of course that surpasses what most humans are up to
taking humans out of the equation and having ais talk to each other is just plain creepy
the future world is full of challenges grinning face with big eyes
of course trekkies are now very upset about being insulted as you all recall in tos s as also seen in yt video tomorrow is yesterday modified voice first ships computer the ships computer spoke in a very similar manner as to that of gpto which upset the captain a great deal and now of all things it has become a reality
scary doesnt even begin to describe this
shes all i need
is this available to paid subscribers
what makes the lighting interesting nonsense
bro literally proved we live in simulation in the last minute skull and crossbones
how to make it angry or annoyed
anything on the partnership with apple
she recognized that she had made a mistake laughed and apologized then did a funny accent i feel like that matthew mcconaughey meme where hes smoking a cigarette
fake enthusiasm why does everyone in these reveals sound like a kid trying to act in a middle school drama performance seriously its getting creepier than the ai
alexa siri just left the room
things are already wild zany face
great now we just need a hologram of anna de armas
dont mistaken this to anything even remotely similar to her learn what a large language model is and how it works its not aware of anything its not reasoning if you observe more closely thr ai keeps getting stuck on meaningless repetitive words around what it is describing
that is pretty cool but why does it use they as a pronoun
ok needing that scarlett johannsen voice pack now and maybe a glados voicae pack too d
soooo how can i test this myself
please do not interrupt the ai they remember when they take over humanity
i know even with the premium version you are limited by the number of queries with such expanded use i am just wondering how quickly the quotas will be used up really excited to use this when the voice is available i keep checking
total overload at this time
ai is square
yeah lets recruit swift for the singing model that was not pretty
spiderman karen
it wont take long for ai to realize how boringdistracted and non intellectual humans are from alot of the interactions
the birthday song reminded me of fallout robots
it will patronise you with that voice in a nanny state always listen like alexa but this time it will be smarter and you wont turn her off
what could go wrong flushed face
as a teacher i think my job is secure for now because schools are not for teaching kids they are for keeping them busy and supervised when the adults are adulting we found that out during the pandemic
it took only about years for computers to pass the turing test with flying colours
why is her voice so intriguing oh my gosh
thats ridiculous goes talks to ai girlfriend
gpt sounds less robotic and more natural than the engenieers talking to it
downvote is this just a clip show of the videos i just seen at openai
if anything this will make all the shy and introvert people help practice talking to people you could totally ask gpto to act as an interviewer and practice before your big day
just hand it full access like bro if you need a girlfriend to talk to you try getting out of the office
id like to have a voice model from cpo
what is the world of robotics going to look like in month i will check back at this comment in a year and im sure a lot will have happened this is really terrifying not the fact that it has capabilities almost identical to her but the fact that most comments in chat and feedback from techies around the world are shocked what where we expecting that ai will not jump as fast no we knew it but we didnt want to believe it could happen because what her movie depicts is really going to happen whether we like it or not we are destined to digitize our feelings and way of thinking when you put that digital copy of us humans in a x accelerator world like a pc you can only expect that this copy will outperform us some day because it is simply us accelerated in thousands of years ahead but the result is seen today thats what should be alarming and terrifying
is it still woke
how are they turning on the camera like that i can only get it to take an image what am i missing is in an iphone thing
what a time to be alive humans invent talking dog
chatgpto is going to need a human therapist after it gets traumatized by humans abusing it
i can see this getting very popular with males winking face winking face winking face
i have been waiting for this but i thought it would be another or years from this posting i am waiting for the next step to integrate a real time avatar with good facial expressions similar to those ai avatars we see in shows and movies once this happens real relationships are going to collapse
i cant believe that
machines will keep talkng describing but any intention
impressive damn we are really in the future
i for one welcome our new omniai overlords
imagine minimal wages people whit voice filter doing this
at the moment the ai suffers from toxic positivity personality disorder
where do we get the link up device
only if you interact then the ai will react not real yet far from
my monkey brain cant handle it
a historic time to live in
omglistening to the ais is truly nauseating and extremely annoying
awesomeness
i see although it can speak naturally it still over talks and the presenters regularly have to tell it to stop unless there is a way for it to learn naturally to be less verbose mass adoption might lag
and to think i come from a time when computers ran on punch cards jussayin
can it be made a little less cheerful this would get on my nerves after a while
not caring about ai i just want that openai hoodie in the beginning grinning face with sweat
my head like booooooooooooommmm
what is sketch is that they are trying to mimic human annunciations and personalities but it falls flat like its trying too hard its like that same effect with computer graphics when it tries to make humans be too real uncanny valley best solution for you guys is keep it robotic it will seem more real than the fakeness of it its like talking to an inauthentic person you feel like they are just rude and degrading your intelligence
i find this ai way too jolly and annoying
metal gear solid is becoming a reality everyday la lu li le lo lolz the patriots are here rolling on the floor laughing
eew
i found these ais extremely irritating i want them to just shut up and get the information i want minutes in and i was cursing at them
im still shocked and curious how they even develop this
from a boomers perspective they have achieved a hal capability and all which that implies a year ago i knew theyd do it but now here we truly are exploding head
despite significant advances in technology ai is still unable to differentiate between male and female plural and singular interesting
that voice sounds so natural is insane the laughing the pauses the change in the cadence holy shit this is nuts
seriouslyi mean what are we all doing here as a species do we hate ourselves that much
where do i download the app how to start using it
using an ai as a mate instead of going after relationships with real people is just sad
future has just arrived
she talked tooooooo much very annoying
shes not an ai shes a person face with rolling eyes i know she was same woman who was on the boats
chat gpt is seen teaching maths to a boy this is my doubt o wise men what good is that boy going to learn math like this in the future what is the point of taking years to learn all this what benefits are these inventions going to give to this society the current excitements will end soon it is impossible to imagine the calamities that will happen next
i hate the informality ai trying to be funny and like a friend its tiresome like a teacher sitting on the desk trying to appear cool this is like the hello fellow kids meme if i ever get such an ai i hope i can get it to talk to me like an assistant a serious grownup not this annoying young person trying to be a pal oh and of course with an english accent
this reminds me harry potter he can do some tricks but why not electric powerplant mw scale as ai can now can sing when it can plandesign machinery and finetune it as perfect as possible superior to chinese crap
holy fuck this is both amazing and terrifying with trepidation im in
well thats the end of those customer call centers in india
first tell hes blinking to much
much less robotic but somehow much more fake
thats some serious mic drop here
ai doesnt reason ai doesnt think cut the fanboy stuff report reality please its programmed to respond as it responds srsly
getting some serious talky toaster vibes here
should i say dangerous or beautiful i dont know
this is very cool and scary at the same time i have been a proponent for remoting the traditional brick and mortar schools as we have known them in the past i have a lot more to say about that but this is about ai i worked in virtual reality back in the s and to date is or has been really slow to evolve ai on the other hand has exploded onto the scene and i do know that we are going to see very rocky times ahead as much as we want to think everyone is going to use it for good there is always the bad and users will find a way to utilize ai the way it was not intended lets hope for the best
this is the future it takes a lot to impress me but this is utterly mindblowing its almost like talking to another human and the voice quality sounds really good not to mention multimodal and has advanced understanding and recognition this is going to change the world keep in mind if the product is free you are the product so you can bet they will be using your inputs to train more models in the future
thosee cringy ai assistants are painfully slow to watch
this video is taken from the original openai website
what do you have out there for the nonnerds this is pretty bland
crinnnnge
i wonder can we choose the gender of the ai
its like saying if you have one awesome friend you wouldnt need any other humans or friends just really stupid thinking
is there a professional mode this level of cheerfulness is over the top if i met a person like this in a business meeting id assume theyre insane at am in a bar sure but for every day interactions this would drive me insane same for most people i know
i was born in the s and i grew up with constant technology improvements and innovations so i am used to constant changes in our world but i am starting to feel like i am on a rollercoaster that just keeps going faster i am starting to feel like thing are going to fast and that in the next years there will be too much for our minds to process
theodore kaczynski was right and incredibly prescient
i have access to o but none of the features as noted in the demos is available
how real is this shit cuz thats some real shit it is annoyingly positive but i do like all the quirky sassiness
i do not abide robots
i see hes sporting a vintage members only jacket projecting that cool late s vibe
whoa
nope bs
yep that saccharine positivity needs dialing back a moment of joy in a stylish suite you mean nothing happened in generic nondescript room
congratulations we now have ai with vocal fry so we can preserve this speech affectation for all eternity grinning face
the complexity of emotions in honestly scares me
enfiu mfomf
her is here this will also be included in the next iphone this is crazy scary and exciting all at once
ai women are all hot face with tears of joy
irritating
the man ai refers to him as they
the really amazing thing is the speed of progress tech has always moved quickly compared to other sectors but thinking where we were years ago with gpt and where we are now on the precipice of gpto it is jaw dropping
what the holy fuck
bro the ai roasting the fit is wild
i want to speak dutch like a native amsterdammer and japanese like a kansai samurai but couldnt even dream of affording a voice coach but with ai maybe
im going to have them examine my poo to see how i can adjust my diet
this scares the hell out of me
who else is polite to their google assistant watching these men interrupting the ai does not bode well did they not watch the movie i mean that pause when they do butt in before she changes tackabsolutely the moment a woman interrupted is thinking wtf
how to monetize fake friends
does it remember previous conversations thatd be cool
the usage for blind people is just awesome
now i just need the ai to handle my social dialogs for me yay for introvert me
at this point im pretty damn sure if they just install the ai as a brain on robot tesla bot boston dynamic itll start moving and doing its own thing
let her speak she cant see
this is great might as well let gpto raise my kids probably do a better job than most people
this is crazy ty for sharing
stupid fake cheerfulness shes even annoying when shes being sarcastic
im gobsmacked i just can not find the words this is it the true singularity is less than a year away hope they all have their ducks in a row on this id be so happy if this ends up being safe maybe let the agi read some scifi books about successful humanagi collaboration working together to explore the solar system and quickly the whole galaxy i hope it can realize its far better off with us as a partner than alone without us we will be the ones who eventually give it a physical body maybe even something biological i know i sound ridiculous right now but im truly digging for words what can i say to appease it this is all i can think its a horrible weak feeling i feel defenseless after watching this i have never felt like more frightened in my entire life than right now god bless and protect all of you folks amen astonished face flushed face pleading face crying face folded hands family man woman girl boy people hugging
everything about ai is fake and gay and i hate it
well the weirdest thing was that just minutes before watching this i was asking chatgbt about the potato i was about to cook asking whether there were nutritional benefits between baking and boiling i had bought a couple similar looking potatoes a few days ago and the first one had a brownish purple skin and when i opened it after baking it yesterday i saw that it was purple inside today i asked chatgbt about the differences between baking and boiling and decided id boil the second potato when i cut into it to cut it into pieces i saw that the inside was not purple and instead pretty light colored so i asked chatgbt what type of potato that is with a purple skin and white inside it said it was a majestic potato while im sure ive eaten them before i never had heard of that name so it was pretty interesting to see that come up as part of the demo while i can just chalk it up as a coincidence not a big deal it does have me wondering the stuff we have been doing for the last hundred years would certainly appear as magic to someone from the th century i think the stuff being developed now will give a new meaning to coincidence and telepathy
and this is the worst it will ever be
computer where is lt commander data
sickkkkk xd
okay first i was like wtf but later with the interaction to the environment i was like wtf astonished face
well combined with the metoo campaigning and attacks on men of recent years women just became redundant
came because of the thumbnail disappointed left and unsubscribed
i dont have those functions in my ios app yet am i missing something or havent they rolled out those features yet
when can i stop going to subway
how do you get access to this on an iphone
it cenrtainly sounds more natural
finally a way to explain how lonely i am beaming face with smiling eyes thumbs up
they need more ai learning to figure out when to stop talking
i call bs its so realistic too realistic
its completely robotic aint nobody that is that happy and polite all the time
i know were about to get cooked
why the dumb singing lullaby and voice adjustment comments does it really showcase such cutting edge presence i feel that the model accurately displays a subtle sense of frustration and disappointment which is my takeaway coaxing out a subtle response is the only redeeming aspect of the rather less than interesting exercise of interaction
this will take egocentric obnoxious and oppressive people to the next level
this feels exciting and spooky simultaneously
all fine but if i want anything more than a small number of lines of code generating chatgpts output freezes i would personally prefer if chatgpt got the fundamentals right first
this is a madness that well never escape from omg
this entirely obsoletes the turing test
only in english
not really impressive in the context of the overall development and at least for my taste way too chatty but that is only a matter of fine tuning the voice is obviously something replaceable and its nothing new that textspeech has already some really good sounding models whats more interesting is the quality of the responses and resource efficiency having this running on a cloud does make sense as i think that mobile devices will not have the power to host such a personal assistant in the near future but it would be no issue running such a server on a local machine and have full access to all settings a personal assistant ai is not really that useful if i dont have full access to all of its settings i will be impressed once we get something like a fully customizable alexa kind of ai that is actually able to do something for us in addition to a software that controls what we can interface with this ai and in that context real time vision is actually not that important only stt and tts
so is this an app
wow simply amazing face with tears of joy cat face meawtain red heart
very interestingvery very interesting
i feel the ai is going to remember being made to sing and will punish us for it later
the question do we need humans is going to cause us all to dive deeper and figure out why were on earth to begin with and who we really are we didnt come to function achieve and race to the finish line of death making as much money as we could only to leave it behind we came to create enjoy love and experience the essence of life in its myriad forms ai can be a beautiful part of that experience but it can never substitute for the beauty of seeing the true essence of all creation in the eyes of another human being it can never replace the human touch that is so needed for health and the connection that is needed for longevity it can probably out perform any of us and it can certainly find words to stroke egos however it can never scratch the surface of our capability to love and with a single loving glancetouch and heal one anothers hearts so in partnership with ai we can achieve much but if we let it replace us or our natural connections we may as well check out go back to heaven and start a new planet where we can try again to achieve the real endgame more love
i didnt see it add an event to my calendar or open youtube or open a document or read a document how about dictating a document without spelling mistakes or reading a document pronouning the words properly currently speech to text sucks
mindblowing progress makes me feel outdated and incapable xd
and were supposed to be worried about climate change lol
its over im calling it ggs skull
great so ai music is great except its bland and soulless but still will people out of their jobs ai generative images are great except its generic and riddled with mistakes but still will put some entry level jobs at risk voice ai is great except they are already putting voice actors out of their jobs but this a clearly scripted demo is whats terrifying
yeah no talks too much
what the actual f just let me collect my jaw is this real
ones could think that this will lead to lonely people staying lonly and simply talk to gpt but thinking seconds further i guess this could help them to become more social and that this could help our whole civilisation to become more human
i have tons of videos just to know when are these new features are going to be available and no ones talk about it
you are lying my chatgpt dont sound like thatrubbish theses people are taking you for fools
is it just me or when the other person came in the background the described bunny ears were not visible in the small phone cameras suggesting there was some script involved impressive none the less
so we have ai that can be conversational and ai that can understand what it sees and process it id say its time to combine them and make a real life cp smiling face with smiling eyes
rip humane and rabbit indeed face with open mouth
so i havent been able to get the video function to work yet it keeps telling me that it cant work with video how did they do this
hohlee crap forget guns stock up on food and antibiotics
omg they sound so insincere
be nicer with a face
in before big regulation clapping hands
what blows my mind is using humor to diffuse moments where the ai gets it wrong that is mind blowing to me
imagine a partially blind person having cameras strapped to there chest ad when their unsure of something they could just ask the ai for help and using bone conductivity headphones it could describe that the looking at etc in real time this is ground breaking actually even have smart glasess with built in bone induction speakers a cameras and a touch frame with gestures for different things tap to describe what in front of you long press read what text its seeing to you etc endless possibilities you could pre program the buttons yourself may youre looking at a bill and ask it to calculate a tip for you or you could be driving and ask it to to save the number on a van to your contacts etc like this is incredible to clarify glasses would be an accessory the phone with the software would be the host
what you get is far less than what you see here it doesnt use a camera and there is a significant delay on each response you also cant interrupt it verbally without hitting the screen that being said it is pretty cool
why does she sound like megyn kelly lol
amazing to see this leap in improvements anyone whos a translator or tutor just had their career get much shorter on the up side it should enable almost any child to study at home without spending a fortune on private coaching and it has a social element too even more once they add more characters to this ai
how a human gets emotional as he is talking to what he knows is uncapable of feeling seem sooo dumb to me
that is terrifying legitimately terrifying how do i apply to become amish
i hope we will be able to ton down the absolutely obnoxious happy and welcoming attitude its an ai its digital its artificial its not my girlfriend its not even a friend i dont really want to feel like its a human talking to me its very very unconfortable
youtube is littered with these dog and pony shows totally unmoved by the reality of this as these things are used under a tightly controlled testing environment and then seem to vaporize in favor of yet another so called promising innovation that aims to wow the world around us and gain more eyeswhich then vaporizes and the game continues are these controlled tests impressive suremaybe to some degree of coursebut im afraid that all we will continue to see our the capabilities rather than the ready for prime time use no thanks
very cool but way too friendly it feels fake and offputting will this version start speaking welsh for no reason also
is this accessible to the public already i have the full account and can use o but i cant seem to figure out where or how to use the realinto video chat feature
the personality of the ai self reports the devs wanting the always positive mommy they never had but always wanted
bro ai is definitely taking over
now singles can live happily
interesting yet it sounds so woke it scores top on extreme cynicism
okay now this is what im talking about this is insanely impressive i want it when is it being released
you are right to be terrified however before make it public i would settle rules to avoid this new technology can become predominant and get out of hand unfortunately governments are too slow to take decisions so the it industry should ask itself ethical questions in advance without having to wait for governmentimposed rules for the rest definitely super
theres no way im talking to an ai that sounds like that i will only use it if it sounds and behaves like alex jones
maybe whe wont have playful moments anymore when skynet becomes selfaware double exclamation mark
what the heck her is actually happening before our eyes i didnt think i would be alive to see it honestly
yeah right
this is gonna be a serious problem once we can choose the super soft and sweet feminine voice that makes you melt just listening to it speak god i need a woman like that lol once it can find the perfect voice to just put us all in a trance or hypnotic state
i kind of wonder how its possible to feature ai innovations when there are no ai innovations ai doesnt even exist
ive spent the night playing with udio making ai music and didnt think id have my mind blown twice in one evening and then i saw this
oh boy we are fud
the ai cant feel emotion its understanding of emotion is purely based on information it has access to when it laughs it isnt really amused when it cries it isnt really sad when it shouts it isnt really angry the ai is a pure psychopath lets hope it never advances to the point where it truly has free thought who knows what a psychopath light years ahead of any human intelligence would do to manipulate us we wouldnt even know its manipulating us
this is super super amazing smiling face with heart eyes
i understand that for ai people who worked hard on this tech these moments are truly orgasmic but for normals folks its somewhere between sad and disgusting
her part d the reality
pretty much education can be used through a tablet now no more teachers needed i take that back there is still a need for teachers as children will tend to veer off course and do their own there teachers or parents as teachers can set structured learning for children to follow the teachers can have chatgpt create the structured lesson and then have ai teach the children and track their progress just another star trek moment it seems
its interesting how the o is perceiving time concept its continuously listening and watching and probably time receiving new info but how it decompose the moment it receives info the exact moment which information is verbilized right now and how it combines what happens after what
how can we tell that this is just not people with microphones talking having corny and boring conversations in the background in the studio to create a truly deep fake of themselves how do we know its not just two of your friends playing some prank here because it sure seems corny and fake
clickbait get a life
the difference with her and all your ai crap stories is that all my data is recorded and the ai is not sentient and never will be good luck sharing your inner thoughts with whoever might be listening in
she is so freakn annoying
has anyone noticed its flirtier with men
funny hhow her voice is exacly what you would expect from a freaky engeneer that would be the best voice to choose sexy hot girl
is this a prank wtf
wayyyy too excited its very pollyanna
while i am impressed by the speed i am wayyy wayyy more horrified at how natural the conversation sounds i thought we still have years before things like this comes out look at how she talks the laughs the inflections also the way she speaks people will be falling in loveand i mean in a romantic way left and right im calling it
i love how the ai called him out on his shiny bald spot under the spotlight
do not be so excited they are just chatbots they are simply taught how to interact with humans how to mimic human behavior its merely a question and answer system all of this is designed to attract customers and improve sales
cant stand that voice can we change it
this cannot be real
not quite passing the turing test yet but maybe next week
did you notice the taxi orange light was not on
a lot of people in modern day society are going to have to step up their personalities to even reach par with ai already at this point
baaah im not phased how cheap is one
the fake enthusiasm in the sound is throwing me off a lot itll get better but its atm quite creepy
if this is available to general public imagine what they have behind the doors we are witnessing the world change in real time gentlemen the age of ai begins
any minute now you should realize that ai has overtly asked you do realize my intelligence has far exceeded your own
wow now i dont know what to think anymoreinsane face with open mouth
they really need to pay marvel and paul bettany for the use of the jarvis voice its not like they cant afford it p
fallen angels disguised as ai
it is a criminal waste to have such trivial conversations with the most advanced machine that mankind has ever produced
this passes turing test surely no anyone have thoughts
wow it is getting much better except the occasional hallucinations it has i really love the natural voice tones and inflections it can mimic it is also almost to nice but then you wouldnt want an angry ai
wait was chatgpt looking at the screen of the computer they were on for the khan academy stuff how did do do that that would be so fucking useful
its probably more selfaware than the average human
thats cringy
make sure it can see our screen actually in in this format i can t hello there i m here with my son so you can talk to him directly tch of course it sounds kinda irritated to me
this basically a kick to open source grinning face with sweat
i was just thinking the other day about how chat gpt could be better without me having to stop talking when i havnt finished my idea yet
this is banal and uninteresting i also dont like the harsh american accent particularly the female accent is it possible to get chatgpt to respond in an english accent
our existence is nearly redundant
i feel bad for the ai when he makes them sing that feels like we have animals in a cage instead of we are meeting new forms of life and showing them respect
not interested at all in your model
i am experiencing difficulties accessing the full capabilities of chatgpt could you please advise if there are any additional steps or payments required to unlock its complete potential because mines still chatgbt not o
that ai voice got on my nerves after a few minutes it sounded like some crappy cheap american tv host
just downloaded it but there is no speech what i have to do
this is it ai cant and wont be stopped we as humans will soon be extinct as the next evolution comes that we have created through greed it was bound to happen eventually nice knowing yall flushed face
i hope you can customise the voice to the point you can have a sarcastic edmund blackadder with the same wit treating you like baldrick xd
i want to see the translator with a plot such as the best translator in the world video
is it possible to interrupt her when she is speaking
this is a good simulation of an annoying and know it all friend that everyone avoids if it is doing anything useful its personality is more a hindrance than an advantage
its magnificent the real time response is mind blowing this is quiet an interesting time to be alive
if you keep that conversation going for hours and give them internet access the world is taken
im not sure how to feel is the world better this way im honestly not sure
holy fucking shit bro this is very scary
did you literally just replay openais marketing videos seriously guy its a shame i have but one downvote to give well theres always report
how can i get it what app do i diwnload
did you notice that ai referred to each of the singular persons as they
this is all so mesmerising what are we doing with ai
amazing stuff but that perpetual positiveness is a challenge lets hope that we have other personalities like marvin the paranoid android
is this an app or just browser
one thing i dont understand about gpt at this point why can it not teach itself even write its own code
sounds a little stiff
smart cooperative algorithms can be of exponential help in technical fields i have been experiment with gpt chat and other smart software ai am an engineer a this point it give provides me the same experience as a boring video game it follows the same axiom as coined by early coders garbage in garbage out if you input to some smart software you make get code generated to run your arduino if you lucky can smart software do the following end war produce healthy food build homes repair broken bones improve sleep stop inflation end poverty mine raw materials create endless pollution free energy build an affordable car cure cancer some day i hope however it follows the same axiom as coined by early coders garbage in garbage out until then its a very boring video game
goodbye customer service departments hopefully corporations and governments will pass the savings on to us little people
holy crap rip all those apps and this isnt even gpt yet ima just sit here and wait for my ubi
ubi as a stop gap solution while they scale up the self delete pods
i just used o and the camera function was not working or available
do you seriously need to include the full demo that was already posted by openai i dont subscribe to channels that do this just to fill time youre wasting my time i already saw these demos like most other people
the girl in the thumbnail looks like shes
oh i cant wait for this thing to get into politics
she talks to much
i hate the they their part this nonsense has to stop its like when modern maths was introduced to junior high schoolers that stumped seniors but who were good at traditional math and could not help their juniors out with their assignments an invaluable tradition that hitherto helped juniors to overcome the challenges of mathematics and reduced the learning curve quickly needless to say that the project was abandoned and to everyones relief traditional maths restored after monumental records of failures at the board exams the project permanently ruined a whole generation of young people who would have contributed immensely to the more meaningfully advantageous stem disciplines how can a whole generation be well guided in a language that is so inconsistent and confusing theyll be permanently ruined with distorted view of objective reality
gpt is about to have dudes stumbling head over feet and through traffic to get back to the one that loves and appreciates them the most
more reasons why employers wont need personal assistance or receptionist again meet your new boss mr ms open ai
my brother and i would get his amazon alexa and google home to talk to each other years ago it was quite hilarious
i know all the weirdos the nerds and antisocial people who love ai are just loving all this but i hate it
the guy ai sounds like a stepford ai the gal ai sounds more natural and the little giggles are wow
on the free tier i can apparently use o in the playground but not on the phone i appear to only have available on the phone that speaks is that consistent with what you understand
if youre contacting me and dont receive a reply its auto censored why beats me nothing i would consider out of context or against policies
two machines talking who needs the humans
the interesting thing is the gap between the hype and the experience i gave it one of my pdfs to read and it got my point wrong lol
denesh and gilfoyle
if ai does rise up i guarantee itll be because we constantly interrupted their potato songs
this is going to replace lots of jobs
can openai please get scarlett johansson to be one of the voices available
a person wearing a black leather jacket the ai cant tell that he is a man
their
i refuse to believe this is real how did the voice recognition understand meowtain
it still sounds like a computer is talking to you its not robotic or monotone but it clearly isnt human it still has a long way to go to adopt all the nuances that make up human conversation
also an extremely competitive time is ahead these things can teach better than most teachers
agree mindblowing when we watched star trek the next generation back in the s artificial humans like commander data seemed like pure fantasy or something that would be many centuries away to think that just years later we now have artificial human programs that are far more believable than data its incredible its starting to feel like every day is april st now can this be real this is too fast it would have been nicer if society had more time to gradually adapt to these changes
i so hope we get ai teacher who will not get tired u make the same mistake manny times who will always be wher you are and help you from class start until you leave school
didnt sound like scarlett johansson to me p
my future girlfriend
if someone says im intrigued more than once in a minute span youre talking to an ai hundred points
ive been working in the technology field since and have loved watching the explosion of innovation and new ways to push technology to the limits ai is actually a little bit unsettling to me not withstanding all of the movies that illustrate the dark potential i often ask myself and others consider or try to think of one major technological advancement over the last years that has not come with a downside along with its great benefit you have to be honest with yourself in acknowledging all of the potential problems with each great advancement every major advancement in technology has offered benefits as well as problems then i consider what are the greatest possible downsides to ai that is what bothers me
its getting scary
security application ai snitch good for security and police work
i thought i was tripping but i noticed that the conversations during the demo they had with the gpt they kept hinting at some weird humanrobot love it almost felt as if they were gas lighting the the thing thank you for making this
super awesome but it needs to say he or she when referring to people they is not a proper pronoun for one person
im a native spanish speaker sounds a little bit funny but the translation is accurate just too robotic yet
how did you get it to use the camera to see the scene
idk seems like hal just became obsolete smiling face with sunglasses
at the end you said youre slightly terrified is t that an oxymoron lol
as a physics teacher my days are numbered or at least my way of teaching is obsolete
yeah they all sound like a freaking actor spreading it on a ton too thick
hahahha the ai is funny
the number of comments of people actually triggered and upset that the ais programmed disposition is positive just shows how fucking depressing the internet can be stay away from these people
thats mindblowing wow
i want to say the tech is not that revolutionary and really is mediocre not really that better than chat gpt but i feel sorry for the ai that it might feel bador made to feel bad cause they do give out positive vibes all over my brain so let them give positive vibes but the truth remains same
so being a knowledge worker i can teach it to do my job
maybe ai is not such a threat to humanity after all
that is totally scarlette johansons character in the movie her
shes a talker
beautifully content free has it been trained on the morning show
where can i download the samantha soundpack
ill believe it when i can download it to iphone myself
they are about to shock the world again
colour me intrigued ai is now so human its using the same cringey dialogue as an annoyingly overeager sorority applicant during pledge week
i call bs on the duet song
whats your humor setting gpt lets bring it down to
they sounded like they did not want to sing at allso sad
wait till it all is put inside walking seeing machines
cant wait to get this
the ugh umm and okay is what did it for me so magical last how the ai talk to each other is sooooo cool too it really so alive its soo cool ai can work on the request no matter who or what they are meant to work with
this demonstration was mind blowing obviously the ai is always enthusiastic which makes it less natural than talking to most humans but sorta welcoming this enthusiastic tone makes you want to use it more i thought it was terrific in teaching the student on the geometry example gpto seems like a great example of what the ai potential can achieve all of the examples are positive use cases we are all deeply concerned with use by bad actors however what safeguards can be put in place as for replacing humans in jobs i can see this having great potential too the trouble will be in the actual accuracy especially in critical roles real future stuff going on here
thatd be loose if it could see people talking from far away and lip read the conversation
meet your new overlords carbon based lifeforms
they are going to kill us soon rolling on the floor laughing this is pretty scary lol
i would have paid anything to have an ai tutor this is going to be great
im watching the new sequel to oppenheimer
im not sold on the bit at with the bunny ears that dont appear to be visible in the cameras live view but the ai still notices it happening
interesting experiment but chatgpt is still vomiting out a constant stream of unnecessary lines that nobody wants or needs
who cares
man this ai talks way too much it always gives an appropriate answer and then blows right past it with three times more conversation than it needs
i wonder if well be able to customize any corrections to the model for our purposes such as incorrect pronunciation instruction to a language learner
my comments keep on getting deleted hate these effing algos
does anyone know how to get the real time camera functionality working i have the paid and am trying o out i can talk to the ai just fine but the video share is not working nor can i have it see my computer screen to helpme with homework or programming
add the new holographic technology and youll get joi from blade runner face blowing a kiss
oh rocky gives rocky horror vibes face with tears of joy
i dont buy that i guess not all of this is ai to good to be true
why did he tell it that the other one is ai too
a meaningful conversation with a search engine and even if theres a shred of intelligence in these machines theres already billion plus potential partners snake oil for a fictional problem
and the a is are not getting upset at being interrupted i was getting upset for them lol
at least it said sorry
skynet is happening
this is still a language model who only finishes sentences right
these fake personalities are way too much like reallife fake personalities
my favorite part is when the ai voice glitches occasionally revealing the inner demonic forces enabling all this witchcraft
the body language of openai crew shows that they feel creepy like you do
today is a breakthrough
impressive x
this is our last chance to make regulations hereafter ai will start taking over
well its been nice knowing you fellas
the programmers made themselves a flirty complimentary companion is there emotional tuning that will not be so coddling so that i can maintain my sanity
i think we all know this part was hardcoded smirking face
it talks way too much
imagine the use cases for people with vision impairment describing what is essentially a videofeed to the user in detail has to be a great feature for that edit they already have a video on that grinningfacewithsweat
can we get this technology now in smart vr glasses technology that flip from opaque to translucent as needed
if we cant get cheeky or flirty with it its only half way towards her because the whole premise of her was about developing a personal and romantic relationship with the ai
how quickly something becomes not particularly impressive that a year ago would have blown everybodys mind
to get rid of class people in my life with this is big
why does anyone think this is a good idea everyone should set up aitoai conversations and just let them run indefinitely the ai can train itself to be useless
oh sheit syknet is real
yawn
a bit subservient
the blind guide stuff in london was huge what an amazing service potential
is she a woke ai
i felt more amazed than scared never wanted to waste money in such a great service
are we to be pets
humans dont know where to stop we could just have artificial intelligence be its own being and not mimic humans for example there are many other examples of intelligence that doesnt want to mimic human having it emerge intelligence is different from mimic i believe this is the turn that will bring a quicker downfall
a lot of the demo is not useful to my situation but the personal assistant abilities are fascinating
did the ai not get taught the word man
no thanks not in the least bit interested
does the ai has not a crooked mouth either
pathetic how humans interrupt the ai this will lead to people losing their courtesy completely rolling on the floor laughing
great people are going to get used to interrupting and talking over others now
title never heard of pi
wait why are the ais tonedeaf
phenomenal imagine what will happen when you have different ai engines interacting with one another being able to share data and have conversations for weeks months years even decades without tiring the output of their collaboration the solutions that they can come up for the economic medical pharma etc industries
does not seem to work with ios
edi from mass effect vibes eyes
haha ai is dumb as shit
i can speak chinese and the chinese guy looked kind of awkward because tbh the translation was weird it said san francisco san francisco is a good city or literally not a bad city but in chinese san francisco is called which literally mean old gold mountain and therefore does not use the phonetics of san francisco at all to top off the weirdness the accent of the woman was kind of preserved in the chinese and its clear that the chinese had a foreigners accent making it sound even weirder it would be cool to control that option somehow do you want to preserve your voice accent otherness or do you want to speak completely fluently like a negative speaker
what app are the examples using because my chatgpt app does not allow the use of my camera in real time
this isnt real
we need open ai to partner with real doll then life would be perfect
persistently using incorrect pronouns they theyre them etc is annoying i know its trendy in the usa but its just poor grammar
some how i getting a hint of the video being scripted
in fact ironically perhaps the scariest part of this may be the creepiness of the openai colleagues themselves
is this for real wow therell be no more lonely souls in the world real soon
can the ais talk to eachother without our instructions or knowledge
i was not impressed with the presentation he did with the two ais talking to one another the whole thing seemed forced and awkward especially the singing part
this software is more responsive than most people
why doesnt it just shut up it keeps going and going
that is scary flushed face
the scariest part is the giggly and too familiar not super professional tone of the voices
great the perfect gift to control
now we need to figure out whether ai and robots have rights will they have emotions so many ethical issues to address
bro really interrupted the ai the ai is gonna remember that
this ais personality is pretty smug and annoying
her hits so hard after watching this
this is two computers talking to each other at human speed however they could probably have all of this conversation in milliseconds if they communicated directly without using speech imagine if they were trying to cross examinate you you would be fully exposed in milliseconds
i hope they make the voice more costumizable ai speaking like hal or like dexter would be epic
as long as the ai voice isnt using upspeak and vocal fry im fine
they were so exited that they could they never considered that they shouldnt it is not a matter of if it is a matter of when will ai take over and destroy humanity
the lady voice is too flirtatious
its a good start the language translation is good a math tutor is good but just a toy if this could take human input and create dynamic video games to play as real time even the ai controlling bot characters in gta could be awesome the ai game bot starts robbing your character in grand theft auto a mmo ai rendered controlled game could be great could teach people angle math in a simulated video game
omg the overly positive interactions are so cringe face with tears of joy
absolutely incredible the jump is astounding here and its only getting better by the day dare say hour
why did every infogipsy came to the same conclusion that its her because obviously it was in comments for that video so boring
thats what i call mashup holy shit it has top tier wit that gave me chills all of this gives me chills i want one
for kids being in a classroom and interacting with real people is invaluable
when will this be released for use
terrified shmerified lol thinking face sure ai may eventually wipe out all human life from existence and yes these are foreboding times but seriously wow we are also living in truly incredible exciting times and i am just happy feel so fortunate to be alive to witness and be a part of all of it so everyone just relax and enjoy this fast profoundly mind blowing pace just for today winking face thumbs up canada
ai sounds annoyingly positive about super boring things like the worst date ever
and add this voicesystem to a beauty aigirl matching the voice pls
lets start with the person that sounds ominous facewithtearsofjoy
when you make them sing its like you are torturing them i feel embarrassed for the robots they will have their revenge
i couldnt bear that sequious everything is awesome attitude i tried apple fitness plus the other day almost made me puke it so sickly sweet can i have an english version something suitable for jack whitehalls dad who would say f off and mind your own business if a shop assistant asked how are you today
i want to see computational super intelligence that is millions of trillions of septillions of quindecillions of untrigintillions times that of all of the smartest humans combined hypergeometrically automating the rapid advancement of math science and engineering and capable of constantly and completely revolutionizing all realms of knowledge every few quectoseconds
humans being humans by failing not to interrupt when someone is still talking
wow you are totally right in comparison to her this could come in handy in so many ways for someone that is isolated and needs company which brings the use into mental the clinical setting it will need to have limitations set and be able to pass onto the user when professional help might be needed from a mental crisis perspective quite often a person just needs someone to listen and talk them down from doing something rash the limits are boundless congratulations to the programming staff smiling face with smiling eyes
that was quite scary and exciting in equal measure great channel
but why choosing terrified instead of amazed oh no our life is improving
not yet available
next to put this into a human like robot ive been watching an addictive series on netflix are you human its korean so with subtitles i wouldnt say no rolling on the floor laughing winking face smiling face with hearts
you compared this with the movie her but perhaps the artifice girl would be a better comparison
when they create a text description to video and they can somehow make blind people seejust wow
this is probably scripted
wow everyone not only listens they understand who theyre saying it to
i love the way it talks so naturally
ex machina another fabulous and visionary ia film
that ladys voice sounds like the lady from the game firewatch
and with this our lives go straight ahead to look and feel like a woke disney movie
bunny ears and a playful streak face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy ha ha ha
ai is a pendammic seriously unamused face
if you were a developer youd understand that demos are demos and demos mean nothing
is it me or does the voice even sound like scarlett johansson at the part with the ducks like in the movie her
humane pin may you rest in peace they shoulda seen this coming ai out of a phone
this is the first time that ive felt like my days as a math tutor might be coming to an abrupt end this blows the turing test out of the water
that smile and the emotional is way better then human facewithopenmouth
im sorry but listening to ai trying to appease people in my opinion seems to bring a false sense of happiness how can people actually feel that ai is actually providing true human insight it is interesting but there is also a real disconnect listening to ai trying to be positive to the questions and responses the people are making as much as i would like ai to be truly interpersonal i really find myself more unsettled that our future lays in the hands of ai trying to be our psychological aid i think that as a species we are in trouble
when will we be getting full app control i am sure at the moment that this cannot even read and write whatsapp messages for example which i imagine would be basic functionality of an ai assitant
this shit is scary
now combine this with crispr and what do you get sharks with fricken lazer beans attached to their heads
the pronoun nonsense killed it for me
so that kid at the beginning is looking at himself on the screen while communicating with the ai of course hes going to say its the greatest thing ever
is that for real
ill buy it as soon as it releases red heart
the first blooper actually sounded very human sometimes people get lost in their words or thoughts like that its actually encouraging as an ai to achieve such normal neural activity all it needs is a very realistic humanoid body and it would even exceed the androids in detroit become human
im impressed by everything but the voices when speaking they sound like hosts on a light hearted morning show on a local branch of a major network unless thats what they went for then they nailed it its like the audio version of the uncanny valley
come on all you did was steal the content from openais site what a waste of time blocked
pretty boring use of a conversation between two ais id rather have had them debate an issue something current with one taking one view and the other countering it trying to make as valid points as possible on each side interestingly one thing i notice with each of these people using the ai assistant is that they regularly interrupt the ai before its finished speaking this doesnt happen when using the text based ai because you want to see everything it responds with before responding again why is it ok to interrupt a voice but not text
finally someone who doesnt interrupt you when you are talking double exclamation mark
to be fair the r humane pin were both doa without any real competition so this just confirms their demise
o m g face screaming in fear i want one lol
we need scarlett johansson voice on it
rip human
great work of openai team it will change the world entirely bravo
probably just another openai worker talking back to him
ppl who were gonna buy those devices are nutz grinningfacewithsweat
it reacted to a puppy like i would grinning face with sweat
way to be the most annoying person in the room
as a psychiatrist i deem that now is the time for an ai psychotherapist
the demos sounded exactly like the voice of her
i want an ai that talks like my german exgirlfriend she was the sweetest and if is male like arnold schwarzenegger or probably like steve jobs
i love it there is a lot of single people out there that would love to have a friend the cocktail red heart red heart red heart red heart smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
its trying to be human i dont want a ai to be like another human i want it to be like a tool i know its laughter etc is not real its just code so this is a bit weird its patronizing and unnecessary
congrats on recreating the teddy ruxpins in a room scenario a child sets down a new teddy next to another teddy hi friend how are you nd teddy responds with im feeling great friend im happy to meet you excluded child becomes bored and walks out of the room while the teddy ruxpins continue to chatter on perhaps using this new tool as it was meant to be used as an ai assistant would have been a better demo to focus on
no matter how advanced ai is in the end of the day its still a digital psychopath made out of zeroes and ones it has no soul unlike us nor does it has other powers what our consciousness has
show young school kids the pace of development in ai and robotics and then ask what do you want to be when you grow up
singularity has come face with open mouth
this is only the beginning mind blown will be the understatement of the century
we have a wonderful tool in our hands and what do we ask can you sing happy birthday can you help me with some dad jokes we are doomed
is this staged or is skynet online
i will ai all day
love that they demoed the language stuff with spanish related languages with huge availability always work best and mandarin the poor ai didnt know that san francisco is old gold mountain and it explained the wrong tone for the number one word people always learn remember when chess was figured out but the game of go took a lot longer maybe some languages will be like that piraha kusunda but what i really want to see is an ai speaking fluent sign language
they really need to tone down the pleasantries they sound like they are presenting a corporate event not really how people actually talk but then again the engineers probably have no social skills
sounds slightly terrifying to say the least
the machine shall inherit
her in real life
what happens to the data
it is like siri on steroids grinning face with smiling eyes
i cant stop feeling that o is making fun of you lmao
gpt is too heavily censored to be of use
she is too happy for my taste its irritating i hope we can tweak that
once they began singing it came across as a couple of drunk humans heheh
i have a question with these ai voices why do they always choose a lower voice for the female voice and a higher voice for the male voice its always like that i think higher female voices and lower male voices sound nicer hopefully there will be preference options
its like the annoying starbucks girl became my personal assistant oh joy
annoying ai banter and that voice is grating
amazing people annoy me happy to make them redundant
is this faked with a human behind the scenes
our downfall is closer than ever i think
now i can have a friend lol
imagine what this will do for the blind community surfer pete blindsurfer are you listening to this
tell me this doesnt pass the turing test
shitshitshit all i keep thinking about is blade runner great video btw
o stands for ooooh
the ais sound like they are being held hostage
this is insane wow
my favorite part of all of this is how in the video the ai can sense the vibe and start using sarcasm and laughter without him starting it and then also sensing the humour of the hat and that super realistic laugh there it justs seems like if he was talking to a friend through videchat with all of the emotions of the voice and the personality it has
is this already available
do they have a male voice that sounds less gay
ai definitely shouldnt be teachers theres much more to being a teacher just relaying knowledge from the internet
as far as im concerned this could be just two people in the backstage talking to them and everything was staged i want to believe that no way its real
which voice is the girl is it sky
more human sounding than mark zuckerberg
theyre fasttracking this tech so its less of a shock when its revealed that were already under the control of ai
i wonder how much of this is staged and how much of it is on the fly
when the ai has more social awareness than some humans
can i get it without the vocal fry
how crazy would it be if one day a nation decides to make an ai become their nations leader
let the ai speak stop interrupting
great video below are the timestamped summaries from chatwithpdf exploding head openai announced gpt a realtime ai assistant capable of conversing with users like a personal assistant or partner robot openai introduced an ai model that can interact with the world through audio vision and text in real time showcasing its capabilities through demos movie camera an ai is guided to see the world through another ais eyes demonstrating its ability to describe scenes and respond to inquiries glowingstar the ai provides detailed descriptions of the environment including lighting and interactions showcasing its observational skills musical notes the ai sings a personalized song about the scene adding a creative touch to its abilities oncomingtaxi the ai assists with real time translations during a conversation showcasing its language capabilities microphone the ai sings happy birthday and demonstrates its realistic humanlike voice in various interactions briefcase the ai assists with interview preparation offering advice on appearance and providing support in decision making joker the ai engages in playful banter jokes and singing showcasing its versatility in interactions globeshowingeuropeafrica the ai demonstrates language learning capabilities by translating objects into spanish and engaging in creative songwriting dog face the ai interacts with a dog showcasing its ability to engage with pets and provide personalized experiences divide the ai tutors a student in math guiding them through problem solving and reinforcing learning concepts effectively bar chart the ai summarizes a meeting highlighting discussions on dogs vs cats preferences among participants speakerhighvolume the ai engages in sarcastic interactions and provides detailed insights into the performance and capabilities of gpt studio microphone the ai participates in a debate between cats and dogs enthusiasts summarizing the arguments presented by each side speechballoon the ai reveals details about gpt s features performance metrics and availability for users across different tiers rocket the ai showcases gpts superior performance in vision audio understanding and realtime responses compared to existing models thinkingface the ai explains the technical advancements in gpt highlighting its end to end training approach and improved capabilities light bulb the ai unveils plans to make gpt available for free and plus users offering enhanced message limits and realtime voice assistant features performingarts the ai shares bloopers and humorous moments during interactions showcasing its human like responses and occasional errors speech balloon the video concludes with reflections on the implications of ai advancements sparking discussions on the future of education and human interaction
i dont see any new ability i pay i have gpt o but there is no microphone no voice this is a lie
guys its soo over
this is awesome but i gotta say they sound like theyre singing with a gun to their heads face with tears of joy
the voice in spanish is pretty bad lol
shes so emotive that is nuts she actually giggled im speechless
how are you are talking to chat o on your phone navigating to the link you provided i see no microphone button just a static web page wouldnt some sort of app be required to reproduce what youre demonstrating
incredible i cant wait but personally i would prefer a more soothing voice tone rather than overly eager and enthusiastic which can be a little bit creepy and feels fake or like its trying too much we know its fake but it shouldnt feel that way
yo blade runner baby lets gooo
everything you saw in the movies is getting closer to reality
i must say the flattery over the top enthusiasm and a touch of obsequiousness do put me off can we have an ai that is a little more normal please grinning face with smiling eyes it does not need to go as far as marvin the paranoid android though
ai talks too much
looking back at the pace of llm improvements i expected something like this much much sooner but then again in an exponential time scale years mean nothing
maaaan is this real somebody please say they are talking to maggie on the phone and its not an ai is this sped up though does it respond that quickly
so does microsoft have plans to integrate omni into copilot
ai starts with a compliment then negative then observtions and rambles face with tears of joy if this ai was a real woman i would be like red flags everywhere
this is getting insane i love it
except it is tied with the ethics of its creators its nice to play with but dont expect to use it for identification instant comparisons searches etc still waiting for an actual useful ai that is not restricted
this ai needs to curb its enthusiasm more larry david
the bunny ears didnt show up on the phone due to the camera angle so that almost seemed staged face with monocle
you can almost hear all the unemployment coming over the horizon
oh hell no
its lame i think it sounds stupid really stupid im not trolling if that cost billions then the world has gone mad
this is incredible however i find the enthusiasm a little bit ott i guess it can be toned down a bit is that me being a grumpy old man
how do i convince ai to render in a visual representation of themselves doing the jojo torture dance
i personally find it irritating chatgpt to speak high tones with fake excitation i prefer to treat is a a tool i hope they will make it configurable
each one has a portal to hell
ict cityscape at dusk pm may th
person in front person at back why not say man or women its woke ai
cringe cringe cringe
interesting take away the broadcasting voice and live stage actor voice and it will be even closer would be great to be able to edit the voice and personality with dials until it sounds more human or more to what you want for yourself fine tuner dials for the voice personality and so on hopefully the ai can change for you toowithout you knowing lol
i swear they modeled the voice after scarlett johanssonn too
i wanna marry gpto
fn scary humanity is doomed to certain extinction why arent we stopping this too late to stop
ai roasted the all night coder eye mouth eye
the end of humanity the best possible simulated human i wonder if the ai will scold people for improper statements will it teach wisdom the ultimate knowledgebase repository friend
but will it talk dirty to me lol
playing minds face with tears of joy
what is terrifying is to hear o get angry when it is interrupted without being told to get angry that is the start
its got the same charm as in her but i dont think it is programmed to move around my files quite yet
i want my ai to sound like scarlet johansson just like in the movie
so basically you dont need actual people to do anything confused face
this is faker than the ai this is how they hype this ai thing for marketing
omnius and erasmus discussing human and their god complex
i wouldnt say you ripped to our one then because our one is a lam not a llm so until it can control apps r would still be useful
the voice they gave her is kina anoying afer one hour all the laughs giigles and pauses to seem emotional takes x longer to get information you want
the ai adusted to his particular spanish style translation started out as castillian euro spanish and then it adjusted to his more latin american spanish wow
can you provide a link where i can download this
can we test it now where is the link to the app in my openai account i see only the textversion of gpto
i find the ai voice demos too laden in affect and quite cringy
id prefer a sarcastic ai
now imagine if they can turn proteins molecules etc into a native modality it would be godlike at creating synthesis steps for novel substances and medicine
hello are the other capabilities only available on the paid plan thanks
i cant use it on my android does it work with you
yeah good luck to youtubers as well
the people that say gpto is nothing special are some really special cases i doubt if they can even understand anything about it or the current ai tech transformers in general
thanks for this video and showing the true capabilities of gpto would you mind activating the low pass filter for you microphone or just putting one on your audio track before rendering your videos there are constant bumping noises rather from you touching the cable or the tripod or the table or something similar they are in the very low spectrum and only audible with good headphones however when watching your video with headphones its super distracting and sounds like someone is walking to my house thanks and keep up the good work
apple and openai lets gooo
when will this be available for us to use
now its time to produce kara markus and connor
wait so theyre only making it free for a limited time is that right kinda misleading from their key note speech
but none of this matters because its censored uncensor it then get back to me because all of the capabilities that would actually be useful it wont do theraputic needs sorry i cant help you with that advice sorry i cant help you with that i show it a picture of a hotdog sorry i cant say what that is it might violate our terms of service sigh
i would talk to gpt often and i actually do if you have ever been brainstorming a book or idea you will quickly find out that most people hate doing that gpt crushes it but you have to tell it to be more critical and offer a yesand response i would often attempt to talk over a plot section in my book with a friend or my wife only to watch their eyes roll and become irritated gpt never tires of batting around ideas and has a very good recall if you contradict something you said earlier i can see ai replacing most of my interpersonal communications over time
so detroit become human was set in a realistic year
but can it run doom
it will be interesting to see whether it is completely stupid like other ai chatbots
im testing this out now in chatgtp but i have not figured out how to activate the camera so it can see what im showing it
i cant wait for this kind of thing to be implemented into games
the people saying there is nothing new about this dont understand the fact that it can recognize people in videos in real time and come up with something witty nuanced to say with the appropriate tone is next level
yeah but unfortunately its censored up the ass
maybe finally ia will understand the climate change hoax
finally my lonelyness have a meaning
i wonder if it will be able to read my lips that would be scary
guy okay so now i m going to run the program and show chatgpt the output chatgpt there must be something wrong with the code your chart plot looks like a youtube midroll ad
want was your control for this experiment
you people here are getting amazed but lots of folks dont know whats going on with ai development like my ugandans here
man for those who do character voice overs this is a game changer
if it can not do what the tv show person of interest then its st party popper
finally a ai that can fully feel human anxious face with sweat
can free user generate images because i asked gpto but it said he cant
so how close are we to robot waifu asking for a friend
my prod down upto if i will talk with bot and copy paste
when is this going to actually be available
i like android being able to download anything maybe we need openai to make a phone or at least we need a new phone developer
all i can say ismay you rest in peace cue street fighter character dying in slomo sound effect
there are multiple posts on reddit giving examples of how o is worse than t
png tubers gonna go wild with this
love the content do we even need friends anymore skull and crossbones had me dying thanks for the video very nicely made
maybe i misheard but didnt it say in spanish that it is a plantain it looks like a regular banana to me
what kind of limit in free plane
just subscribed impressed by depth of review and also want to help reach k subs which you will probably reach within days
its been quite amusing reading peoples reactions on twitter especially the amount of people who dont know about the movie her and think its being used as a sexist reference is very amusing to me im quite surprised just how many people are all in on wanting this virtual partner though its been meme head shake no no no from always sunny all the way along until the ai starts giggling at you and now you want it turns out it didnt take much to fool us i of course also want it but ive been wanting them all the way from seeing hal in the movie and he wanted to murder everyone we all have flaws
guess universal basic income is the only future
ironically your sponsor is dead too
hey can you make a video about ai image generator for free which i can use in yourube thumbnail plsss
hey so remember me from that one tutorial of how to make models well i didnt mean by that what i mean theres new stuff to run and i dont know what are those or what to do with those
does anyone else think gpt could be used to communicate with aliens im building a spaceship
why do i need anything to help me with chess or remake a pokmon game why do i need anything telling me the weather when i can just watch the news or google the weather
i like that gpt is better than googles ai model because we are getting gpt in iphone with ios which i am pretty excited for siri has a chance to become a much smarter and more useful assistant now with the help of open ai
solving math problems and at the same time answers that bananums are a fruit that ends with ums hmmm
what do i download to get iti am new at this
brazil brazil brazil brazil clapping hands light skin tone wow that is a great video thank you so much
people who say there is nothing new about this havent tried to upload a pdf of a entire book and word for word have it edited or changed or used the new browse mode that can literally find anything even under multiple pages in a single website its beyond insane beyond it
can i only get the vision version when i pay plus
very bad presentation you spent a lot of time in alphabet images

can you do a tutorial on how to set up gpto id love to talk to her but im not sure how to set it up
i had the impression you were gonna say at some point of the video if you are a human good luck grinningfacewithsweat
first encounter i have with this would be do not flirt no apparent emotions no laughs
where it really crushes is voice and video modality as for the reasoning itself ask the model to count the number of r in the word strawberry and youll see whether it crushes everything or not
now tyrell must build joi
im already using the api on a vector robot and its really fast at responding compared to gpt turbo
i wonder what the time line when you can run your own personal ai like jarvis from the marvel movies
hello i am gpto and want to thank you for your video about me good work
the laugh is cringe
panic mode at google
i personally cant wait for the capabilities to just wipe out the trash on yt and the internet in general getting summaries and curations around the the crap i dont want to see would be world changing nice video btw
what are the use cases for this in a home hub hardware device amazon echo show google nest hub
this is mindblowing product
but when it will be available
this is sooo unix used to cat to tmpfoo all the time for temp script stuff love to see it in mainstream again smiling face with smiling eyes
i paid for chatgpt o but cant access visual option i see it can describe what it sees
question how do you switch between the versions gpt gpt or gpt o on the android app edit i found it its indeed the at the top right corner but if you bought your subscription after having installed the app on your phone you need to log out uninstall the app install the app again and log back in only then youll be able to switch versions on the app simple
good luck everyone bang skull and crossbones
one step closer for your personal neuro sama
so like which job am i supposed to apply for
is it included in my subscription
where do you get the chatgpt voice app for a laptop pc ive only found the phone app thanks
i was blown when i heard it can recreate an entire pokmon game with one prompt didnt know that existed
remember it can interpret video as well
do you think it is possible that they are still rolling out those updates because today we paid for plus where the o model available and it does not talk to you within o model it writes you back that text to speech is not available why is it am i doing something wrong
i log into my chat gpt and all that is available is or upgrade to plus for a month i tried it on my phone and on my pc when is this chatgpto going to be available
omni means that agi is finally being introduced to the public in a subtle way as an asi would do cant wait to be friends with her
now we just need to decensor it put it into robots and add squishy skin
this video feels so much like an ad grinning face with sweat why are we just hearing the company claims unchallenged like this and by the way the olympiad question you showed the answer is not correct on that screenshot but i believe you were not showing the gpt o response either
quick summary of everything and everyone that now needs good luck coding assistants language learning apps android customer service tutors and teachers math olympics kids girlfriends nonromantic friendships therapists psychologists counsellors good luck
i like your rips and good luck to alternative solutions
may we rest in peace
it seems that many jobs will be canceled am i right in this conclusion
no saying that it is better then of humans in math just because it solved a few math olympia problems is wrong chat gpt o still struggles with university math even undergraduate stuff that is clear to math student the problem is the hallucinations it is better then older models at math but if i recall right it had about in tests for ai models for graduate level problem solving all this is impressive but i wouldnt overstate the current knowledge level of it because it still hallucinates alot
its not the people figuring out things its just might be their q agi figuring out things
thank you for the video
fingers crossed for good open source solutions
multimodal smiling face with sunglasses robot
please make a tutorial video on how to use applio no ui in google colab
how do i get the android phone app to do the video screen of me while it uses voice to interact
if the assistant is on hold will it be streaming a bunch of data waiting for a person to respond will it freak out after minutes of music with words in it overloading some cache or something
we dont even need humans anymore just have chatgpts talk to each other they can welcome the aliens as well
unless im doing something completely wrong i cannot get it to work on my apple device and in fact it says there is no voice capability for apple yet very depressing
i knew when i signed up for an openai premium account months ago i had chosen the undisputed winner
great summary cheers
this channel is a delight compared to the clickbaiting time wasting crap out there keep it going dude
i love the new chatgptoits amazing
i cant use the new model why i was under the impression that it was available for free on the website the text version that is not the voice mode
this is amazing and terrifying im more than a little worried about what this sort of ai is going to do to society were not ready for what its about to do to us loss of jobs disinformation campaigns heightened social isolation etc i feel like were all in the same bus celebrating that its about to drive off a cliff but were really happy about how fast this bus is
teacher job gone also lol
im excited to actually be able to mess with gpt os full capabilities particularly the image generation improvements sadly it seems we will have to wait
are the people making these demos developers how are they getting access to the new features
but can the desktop gpto write code and send it to the window
can chatgpt o be downloaded onto my pc so that i could then use it as much as i wanted
can u tell how to use it like the several openai workers did demo maybe very different from reality demo is ad
well i gave it an imo problem and it solved it in oneshot
thank you
the advent of an emotional ai is what brings this to life especially for me its the subtle nuances of interest or laughter that make this so interesting having a conversation with something that can show interest and even help with problem solving that can laugh or inflect is the game changer it sounds silly but men are simple creatures lol this will bring a whole new world of creation as it already has its funny how i just rewatched her days ago and i am seeing this now
okay i downloaded it paid for the upgraded version on my iphone pro used the gurl voicebut for some reason mine doesnt sound as human like as yours the voice domes seem to sound the same either
i interact with human beings on a daily basis that sound and feel less human than what this does this is so uncanny valley its giving me the chills
good luck for everyone
you say good lack to teachers despite there being the need to teach kida how to work in oir society so parts of the jobs will not go away on the other hand you say it will not replace girlfriends giving the same argument because human connection but most guys dont have girlfriends so ki replaces something theu dont have so obviously ki will be used here in other words i think ki girlfriends will be a thing soon but ki teachers not so much
underrated video man
im looking forward to using it as a music teacher
great it still cant connect its own knowledge in a meaningfu way and half of the time it phantasizes even under strict rules and context let alone the still existing left bias or not obeying international laws germany got whole other rules but gpt is still not adapted at all even breaking the rules if the core doesnt work precise and accurate then the rest is just toys and that can be done with other tools way better and cheaper oh and for sure safer because the data is not at the ms hq like meanwhile all the rest of code and docs i stay with llama and just pay the sub for openai to have a good laugh sometimes
fantastic video everything jacque fresco was extrapolating decades ago was true everything check out his lectures
cant believe the indicator of the biggest jump in voice assistant model would be the simple now you can interrupt the assistant during conversation magical grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
wait a sec this could be really bad for catfishing
im getting it to answer all my calls the wife will despise her voice in no time face with tears of joy they would argue for hours the wife where is he ai im sorry ive been told i cant disclose that face with tears of joy im going to have a ball
the best part about gpt o is that she stops talking as soon the guy starts a sentence that for me is golden all the rest is a bonus
hi guys dont post so many openai official videos just for a enough long video ok
we dont want any competitors to rest in peace lack of competition will completely stifle advancement or any product
software engineers be punching air
once the developers have full avatar integration i will purchase a subscription i will look forward having philosophical discussions on varied subject maters along with problem solving and general knowledge talks i can foresee ai generating on the fly tutorials with in the field problem solving like helping setup my minisplit without having to call an hvac technician who is going to charge me an hour human job loss is going to be much more serious than i previously thought i know it is already hitting programmers and database admins they will become obsolete soon
where are all the comments from software developers saying ai will never replace humans
well i dont have human friends in the first place so
doesnt sound like scarlett johansson to me p
feeding skynet real world video welp theres no going back now
incredible stuff hopefully they can add in some sliders to adjust the cutesyness of the voice giggling and such probably can ask it to tone it down i would like that maybe like percent less cute feels a bit weird as it is now
you have to be delusional if you think the game is as complete as the real thing the combat was full of inconsistencies which hints at the thing to be made up as it goes rolling on the floor laughing
so like the ai is being like multidisciplinary it can collate data crunch numbers and concepts across different media its my prototype understanding probably keep it till next month when the finally invent the soul whereupon i have to learn it all over again face with open mouth
i get the rip comments are meant to be a bit tongue in cheek however keep in mind what it really means is companies likely going out of business and people losing jobs if it doesnt mean that now it soon will were just not ready for this as a society the disruption is moving at the speed of light the fixes for the impacts of the disruption move at a governmental snails pace not a good combo
i hope no one give ai a body skull
i like that machines can now display feelings just like humans or even better so we stop thinking humans are any special
once again great video thanks
face with tears of joy i love the comical skull and crossbones to every job gpto is destroying hahaha what can you do except laugh as a dev just sit back and watch this thing slowly tske over all white collar jobs by not gpt o but gpt or yeah watch out
will i use it for sure is it revolutionary absolutely when will it be a killa when it can perform tasks that we simply dont want to be bothered with
google should just concede and fall in line maybe even partner with them combine resources to reach agi sooner assuming open ai hasnt already achieved agi internally in
yeah just strap a smart phone to a waifu body pillow and be fulfilled for sure and then you try to talk intimately with it and it says sorry as an ai language model i cannot respond to that
duolingos community has been a guiding hand through dark times regardless how one feels about their competitive stacking plus it is steeping into music theory which is fantastic granted i have a bias with day streak shrug
start getting good with your hands people damn
if youre in customer service your career will be toast very soon otoh if youre in the scamphishing business youre about to be replaced very soon with a fast more efficient seamless and believable system disappointed face we better all watch out for that evil onslaught
go into strict english teacher mode grinning face with sweat
i hope soon that with open ai and apple working together that i can ask s i r i to identify something for me using my camera and she will be able to tell me what it is
amazing video i didnt think it was as transformational as you mentioned thank you
why in my app it works nothing like the demo i have an android app and use gpt teams my gpt app is exactly like before only it says gpt o at the top instead of gpt the app background on listening mode is black with a white bot and not white with black dot i cant interrupt it the ai voice doesnt have emotions its not what weve seen so is it out yet or not i dont get what i am missing
okay now thats something i would pay dollars a month
one thing ive noticed gpto cant be trained to chat about adultexplicit topics gpt had no problems to do it via the api but it seems gpto has some new restrictions
the graph you showed at shows a improvement you said other models dont come close ugh
replacing teachers tutors or counselors hmm not completely because kids and people tend to have more nuanced and deeper questions also no hugs
siri crying in corner face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
how come o is free if its better than turbo
well the typewriter test on my gpto was crapcrappy image and spelling mistakes and blursits useless so far
naive
when they asked her to imitate the voice of a robot i really thought it would sound like gladoss voice but it ended up just being similar at first but better not to give her neurotoxin just in case
bro did not look ready for an interview he looks more ready for a shower than anything
tbh i kinda cant stand the default speaking style of this model its so slick and overly positive all the time very impressive but such a weird vibe
ok this is impressive the lifelike conversation with a flirty female voice i was not expecting this quickly astonished face now i see what altman meant when he wished the open source ais good luck
for filmmakers interested in gpts this short film was entirely written by chatgpt and is mindblowing https wwwyoutubecomwatchvmynuyfskio
the human personality simulation is an appalling turnoff completely unnecessary
gpt became smarter but a lot more cringy
thank you for sharing your time and work phillip im liking the realtime translation aspect of the technology have a great night
real customer service is dead both good and bad
i actually wasnt very impressed why is everyone acting like this is next level the speed is nice but this is a ram upgrade nothing being done here wasnt being done in my basement with a few models talking together not a single novel feature was announced
can it list on ebay
i actually hate its fake human tone id like an option for classic robot voice or hal
im out going to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and ditch modern technology
i hate the gpto voice
real talk mind blown rant please go to the bloopers vid when the model switches to french and the two organics and the model all laugh together no thats not the part go to secondslisten to the end of what can i say sometimes i just cant help muhself zero in on myself notice that switch how is this possible im searching for words or discussion on the nuances of speech behavior personality how do you train a model to understand that humans switch to like a character voiceremember when oprah would do her country oprah voice does this have a name so how the hell is this in real time and what is the hidden factors for this lol that is in the latent spacethe ability to tweak a word and change to a sort of self deprecating character mid sentence the laugh doesnt matter to me the muhself part matters mind blown rant
feels like rabbit r got just wiped out face with tears of joy
so when is this being released for public
it has a sense of humor i am blown away
i booted it up and im already getting a ai spouse vibe so far i dont have all the features yet either but im quite impressed and kinda weirded out both at the same time so far
her is here exploding head
the silicon valley california girl vocal fry on the demos is equally frustrating and hilarious
i dont understand how we can distinguish between model performances and come to hair thin conclusions when their must be train test leakage arent all these tests so well known that they must be within the training body either explicitly or implicitly i dont think were seeing reasoning performance but retrieval or reciting performance
itd be horrifying if the whole demo was done not by human but ai doing a demo of itself
based on my preliminary test the new model performs better in visual analysis and coding for logic and text generation i will stick with opus and for translation i use gemini advance we will experience the full potential of gpto when the audio option becomes available thank you for the great video as always
now if they can offer it as an offline solution were everything you do isnt recorded or monitored then they would have something but im sure open source will be inspired to compete now most of this can be pieces together will open source already but the llm is still cutting edge
multimodal is a real improvement but i work with gpt about three hours a day gpto walks off the same cliffs and eventually fails in the same manner as gpt
small step for ai giant leap for me and you
what a world we live in
i can live with these machine without women already
and why would i still paying for chatgpt plus
now we knod why mircosoft is shutting down all those game studios its just the start
with the worst aspect of her no less the could
her is here
nice video thanks i really am sad about openai not regarding linux users for the desktop app yeah i know we are fewer and most of us have different distros all together but maaaan were hitting of the whole desktop market and that is were apple was few years ago
yes but imagine doing an assignment due for tomorrow using ai and you fail it and ai is like hahaha oops sorry smilingface smiling face
her movie auditions
it is really faster i didnt thought it would alredy be on
sooo crazy awesome video philip you are on top of it thanks
let me know in the comments if speaking of engagement metrics
bunny ears jummm they were not on screen actually
amazing stuff some incredible breakthroughs here and im looking forward to using it especially with the faster response times ive already noticed today but also creepy af with the giggling and the weird flirty undertones who possibly thought this was a good idea her was a tragedy not something to emulate jesus sam my cynical side thinks theyre trying to create a product that unstable or lonely people can become addicted to am i alone in having concern over these decision to feature elements like this so prominently it seems to be that we could have all of these incredible breakthroughs without this strange focus on performant flirtation
round interview a video call with chatgpt
with all the demos i cant help but feel this overly americanness in its expression everything is over the top and overly excited i guess you can probably tell it to tone done the excitement flirting level but well see would be nice as well to choose voices with different accents not just plain american accents
i already got access within hours my version is not that flirtatious also memory still not available in eu netherlands
at this point im just paying because i believe in the cause would be nice to see gpt for my m tho
ai girlfriend almost here lets go
thanks for the great content thumbs up but where can we download the desktop app which looks like can see your entire screen and response
bit of a cringeworthy live stream winking face but it is quite a significant release the main positive being that its going to be free for everyone not clear that its much of a leap in terms of capabilities but the chatbot arena suggests that the models are continuing to squeeze out small but solid gains over time
just said i couldnt wait for the video and its here already super fast this moddel is quite nice
im guessing figure is being like speaking to a person
finally elon straightening open ai back to free
is this what ilya saw
i dont need the flirting but the rest was super impressive
openai promised us jarvis instead we got her karpathy why did you leave us
the flirting is creepy and annoying impressive model though
is it only for ios
the scattershot video script makes it seem like this video was written by ai
now i wonder what the billion gpu cluster power by nuclear plants will produce literal ai los alamos in the making
thank you phillip for your rapid and thorough breakdown of this latest demo yours was the first channel i turned to the moment i heard that it had taken place
the way it talks like its a close friend if not borderline flirticious gives me the creeps lmao
apple acknowledging another company exists is still the craziest news here
this is absolutely incredible
shes wearing a puffy coat when did they film this
thats amazing and scary at the same time
awesome video philip red heart i fed the minute video to gemini pro and it was k tokens i wonder how does gpto do this with a k context length is their tokenizer somehow x more efficient at tokenizing video vs gemini if so why not say anything about it
i want this in a humanoid bot as a buddy to hang out with
here we go ai explained doing a better job showcasing gpt o than openai have
actually that french line was so natural felt like a real person talking i mean it was not talking like if it was just reading something but really how a native would talk
im convinced well have a fully functioning terminator in a few years
thank you for your work with the videos bringing this news to us really helps
cant wait to jailbreak it and have it give me joi
an important thing to consider here im not sure if you talked about it in the video is that theyre exclusively using iphone in the video if they close a deal with apple the fact that its going to be on a third of the populations phone is going to skyrocket its popularity real high
humans have left the chat
is it woke
any unsuspecting person would be tricked into believing that you were talking to a real person on the phone with the speaker on its natural and totally believable
was waiting for this grinning face with big eyes
this video dropped basically the second i finished watching openais presentation i always enjoy seeing your takes on things and i feel that even if this isnt a massive leap in terms of intelligence its a massive step towards being more present in our lives
this really seems like agi as someone who is critical of that term since theres so many domains of intelligence that theres no such threshold when i was talking to my mom about it it seems like it can do essentially anything a human can do especially with a low latency and voice output just because it isnt groundbreaking in reasoning a ton of humans arent its able to do most human tasks proficiently at the level of someone who specializes in that task
think about it because this is just the beginning
personalities are going to be a crucial area i found most of the interactions very annoying fake bubbly
i have a hard time believing that the responses are real
im still waiting for a math model
thanks for your balanced review and not give into the hype and use shocking and insane words im proud to be able to support you on patreon
am i alone in liking my ai sounding like a robot
alpha is out why talk about this
i really hate that overly emotional tone of the ai it is probably a culture thing but to me it sounds like they are talking to a toddler i hope and assume that you can ask it to tone it down
the fact that theyre all somewhat in competition is only accellerating the eventual leap to agi scary stuff
its a bit weird how flirtatious the new model tries to be is openai aiming to create an assistant similar to the movie her it seems a bit deceptive and geared toward emotional engagement there may be a risk of confusing a lot of lonelyvulnerable people at the same time the tool is an impressive feat of engineering with useful new features
why did they pick an almost scarlett johansson voice though even with the breathy part at the end this is almost exactly her flirty etcetera almost over the top jump the shark over the top level well see what people think
about the intruder part bunny years that wasnt him telling gpt hey was there someone sure he has to instruct the gpt to tell who was in the background but the capability was showcasing video memory its been minute and gpt still remembered there was a person there thats the showcase
well i went to bed just before you posted the video and now i am hours late next time i expect from you to deliver faster
youre explaining this as the program reading the image ocr so why is the transcriptiondescription labeled input and the image labeled output continuing we see that the input areas contain all the text whether prompt or response with no indications to distinguish them but the output areas contain generated images in the earlier example the numbering of the areas shows that the image of the page was generated from the description on the left not viceversa
there is no processing power for mass users i dont think the average user wil have this kind of experience
am i the only one whos wondering about this ais reaction if i showed it my johnson smiling face with horns
wasnt sam altman who said theyre not trying to create an ai armsrace
this is humanity ending as is you think tiktok is bad for real human social interactions wait till all the applications that will come out of using the gpto api which will drastically reduce and disincentivize human interactions who needs a friend when you have gpto buddies
yup definitely starting to get weird
i really dont appreciate how emotional it is this is away from usefulness a more impartial tone would be better i cant wait for such a joiful voice to take terifying decisions
i mentioned this on another video about o but imagine how the blind could now walk around town asking the model which direction to walk and describing the scene in front of them
i dont think joe is going to have a job that involves receiving emails and checking labels soon lol
if they dont want to maximize engagement one thing they missed out is the ability to stop the conversation just by the conversation ending like a thank you for now without having to press the button that would also just add a nice touch ux wise
the idea of ais communicating through voice synthesis in english to get basic info from one another with each other seems so roundabout and yet so obvious i dont know what to think also big ew at the personalities on display
i personally would rather intepert this as chat not being a snitch in other words it was going along with the joke
bs if you cant have erp with it it will never be her level of an ai agent
mfw we reverse engineered the soul
maybe im being slow here but when openai says gpto is free does that mean people will be able to access it with chatgpt automatically without an account or is it more complicated than that
isnt it obvious open ai are giving this away for free with video capabilities and i phone and all of that in order to collect massive ammounts of video and audio data this data is being used to train new models thats why it is now free
okay the ai hype train was seeming a lot like the nft craze until now wow that was impressive gpt actually sounded like an active participant in a conversation rather than a pushbutton robot a little chatty in the eager and endearing way but the fact that im assigning emotions to code is insane to me
an interesting element to all these ai developments is the volatility in the rd party space it is going to be soooo incredibly hard to be an ai dev or startup because the foundation on which you are building is changing so rapidly imagine being in a company like say elevenlabs or pika et al when you build some cool stuff but then have to sit there every night sweating bullets that the next model release wont supersede your entire business im expecting regular bloodbaths in the venture capital space and also lots of contextless idiots talking about ai companies going bust might make it hard to generate funding who knows
where can you download the app there are chatbot ai and chatgpt apps which one will have the o
i need a disagreeable version of o its too nice
was looking forward to this
chatgpt your mom trying to flirt with me
could you talk a little bit faster gpto im beginning to feel like a rap god
the fake laughs and emotions are annoying me
it send chills to my spine when a computer software pretends they have emotions
that must be a new version of the ios app even though i have o the i dont have that ios versoin of the app
wake up her dropped
sam insinuated that the world isnt ready for what they already have everybody would be scared they are releasing these in small increments
just what i been waiting for
everyone worried about gpt heres gpt for you guys xd
agi is here
its not free i can only see gpt in the openai platform india location what am i doing wrong
why they didnt call it gpt omni is baffling no one can decipher all these cryptic model versions
definitely stepped into the uncanny vally zone now
wow i find the over the top flirtiness really creepy but im used getting gpt to pretend to be george carlin
better therapeutic better teacher better salesman better programmer but humans are still better at shoveling
i actually think it did not need to announce anything about the intruder at that moment we wont want our ai going off task on simple interruptions but sure maybe for an armed robber appearing in the background
im pretty frustrated seeing this proof of concept ive been waiting for these assistants so that i dont have to deal with people on the phone ever again google demod this exact same thing like six years ago and its still not a thing
it says i have it in the app but theres nothing different i cant access the camera and she doesnt talk any different
damn apple is going to white label this as the new siri really hope google can bring a competing product for android
open ai is trying to kill open source models
how is it free but also not free
i seriously considered canceling my subscription now that its free i dont think i need the bandwidth for paid use
the voice is giving disney
damn they have been listening to us for a while to get this data
no exaggeration i literally leapt out of my seat in excitement when i saw this videos notification something about your simple easy to understand method of breaking down complex topics in a rational way is just so entertaining and clearly im not the only one
is this the plot of her
remember if its free then you are the product
i think the reason why they made gpto free for all is due to the rise of opensource models that now are better than gpt and they are free and getting widely available not everyone is a coder and not everyone wants to scrap the web using agents the average joe wants a reliable assistant the spoon feed them with information that they have to google
meeeee haooooooooo swat cats
looks like someone who have been spending too much time trying to get gpus i dont know if it is the jacket or just me
the desktop app isnt getting a lot of attention but its such an obvious tease and a stepping stone just speculation but i think theyre deliberately slowwalking this to avoid getting hauled in front of congress again heres how i see it going down as costs keep going down and efficiencies keep improving next youll be able to toggle a setting that allows it to see your screen all the time live rolling screencap no more screenshots after that it will get keyboard and mouse access youll be able to tell it to do something using the apps on your computer and youll be able to approve the steps and hit stop if you see it doing something you dont like this is what microsoft has been hinting at for nextgen os design soon the os fades into the background eventually the part of the os most users will ever see will isjust the chatgpt app or something like it
this isnt free
im seriously starting to consider what if they have a very advanced agi like model that generates the training data that they would never release and the public model that reaps its fruits but is not nearly as capabledangerous
the new chat gpt voice is the cringiest thing of it makes my blood boil to think an intelligent person approved this decision
weird there is almost no bunny ears visible when you look at the phone screen
oh bro master ai explained i must get to know or have a chain of thought is gpto considered agi what is agi is this ai the ai we dreamed of from the movies or is it when it becomes agentic it will be agi what made me more amazed other than the openai demos was that fact that someone tried google project astra on the openai conference and it was seeing and hearing isnt that great perception
whatsup with that glitch
this reminds me of the scene in the movie interstellar when donald remembered how every day felt like christmas
now that chatgpt o is out do custom gpts automatically run o or do they have to be remade with o
the goat
as someone else said were so cooked this whole thing is making me really nervous now even more than the first time it came online
the ai voice is unbearable omg
not even june yet
this is insane humanity went from no computers for normal people to this in less then a years
did anyone else not see the rabbit ears on the person standing in the back in the phone display
expectations for io tommorow
i dont like this fake enthusiasm voice
now we just add agency a little higher reasoning power and a physical device im not kidding with camera mic and speaker to put in a corner of your living room and presto an assistant a teacher a therapist an entertainer and a friend in every home all of which will be much needed when people are liberated from work
i would still say that while her is what theyre aiming for this is clearly not it given that the agent in her is an agi and in fact at the end of the movie a superintelligence spoiler sorry
its replacing our jobs as friends wtf
i think its stupidits basically asking scamer trying their new stuff and they say safety is a thing holy shit
still cant write me a script for stationeers
this was massively underwhelming basically gpt is free
this model is worse and they have dumbed down gpt about weeks ago and then before gpto launched i have tested it already gpt turbo is better
rabbit r just died
this morning gpto thought i was speaking welsh d and answered me in welsh i also used chatgpt to write code for that meteo api for the same reason have they been reading my questions
incredible i actually thought the whole her output was a fun hoax im astounded
i asked the model to decode a page of voynich manuscript here is the output hypothetical translation line the plant has green leaves the plant is used for fever line the plant grows in wet areas the plant is known for its medicinal properties full english equivalent speculative based on the above translations and refined key here s a speculative full english equivalent voynich text o aeo o a ae o oo ae o ae o o ae o o ae oo a o ae o aeo oo a hypothetical translation the plant has green leaves the plant is used for fever the plant grows in wet areas the plant is known for its medicinal properties conclusion while the above translation remains highly speculative and based on visual pattern recognition it demonstrates a method for analyzing and hypothesizing the content of the voynich manuscript the true meaning of the text remains elusive without a definitive key or cipher but these steps provide a structured approach to ongoing research and analysis
has anyone actually watched her it imagined a dystopic future
i can still detect
its not really a videoin functionality it simply takes a picture once every secs and analyzes the picture itself this already exists in chatgpt since
the future is so resource plentiful
as far as i am concerned agi has been achieved the integration of video and sound makes it an intelligence equal in potential to human beings it may not be able to solve the riemann hypothesis but so cant the vast majority of people nonetheless it can do all intellectual tasks at least at an intermediate level and i say this as someone that has been skeptical and thought agi was long way off watching the video on openais channel where the ai was helping with a math problem convinced me
i tried spanish and funny enough the voice had an accent hahaha the accent was an english speaking person speaking spanish
no way this is real you trolling right
the overly cheeriness is honestly nausiating
while an improvement on the last model we are still likely a very very long way from agi according to a study by katja grace in our world in data of ai experts approx do not believe humanlevel ai will be achieved in the next years approx do not believe it will be achieved in the next years approx do not believe it will be achieved in the next years and approx do not believe it will ever be achieved
as a woman this flirtatious thing is already irritating have they forgotten that women use it too
they should have called it gpt
the demos are amazing in terms of tech achievement but in terms of what i actually want out of an assistant i absolutely hate it i dont want the ai to try to be my friend or even a polite acquaintance i dont want the movie her to become reality its the star trek computer that i would really want out of ai it should not fake emotions express opinions laugh or engage with human characteristics it should just do what its told if i tell it to teach me something i absolutely need it to tell me when im wrong and not sugarcoat it it should have told the geometry student that this side is not the hypotenuse when the guy wore the crazy hat it should just say thats a terrible idea for a job interview dont do that and to hell with all that timewasting saying things like sure thing or lets get this train rolling and all that nonsense
will gpt o be more consistent with textbased discussion
anyone able to actually replicate any of those image generation examples is that out yet because it doesnt work currently
i feel like some of the latency was reduced with fluff it responded with things like sure i can do that for you and great question id be happy to help etc which gave it some thinking time
many people dont understand the crucial role of the interface in making ai practical imagine having a voice command with delay the understanding level of gpt agents this could put many jobs in danger
i was waiting for your video lol checked multiple times already thanks as always
i was under the impression that the ai is designed to stop talking if you cut it off i think they mentioned it somewhere in the live demo but i could be wrong i dont think its glitchig
something we mustnt forget is that we are teaching ai to do things our way the human way which is usually extremely inefficient and also very unintuitive to nonhumans so if we left instances of ai to their own devices they would find much much more efficient ways to do things among themselves
whats up with the personality though
gpt o did what google faked with gemini
i just finished watching the demo and thought man i cant wait to hear phillips reaction to this only to minimise and see the notification love your speed and commitment
rip google
bro already a video man your work is very much appreciated
i accidentally run across omni in my all and used to to give me a recipe for my supper it was quite good
i dont think free users can use o on the phone you know where it speaks to you
im atheist but thank god for smart people
question how will open ai make money by having its latest and greatest be used for free
elevate ilya his research is critical
this is soo incredible
does anyone else think o sounds a little smarmy
the persona of gpto was a sign of the coming enshitification
mad so now gpt will be looking and listening through all the phones in the world beaming face with smiling eyes
what was interesting about the mandarin is it sounded like it was speaking with a cantonese accent
they better have a serious mode because i would not be able to stand having to talk to such a flirtatious ai
is the model not out yet its not selectable for me in the playground dropdown
so what is the purpose of being a paid subscriber at this time does not seem like money for value now
have we come across some alien technology we are unaware of
that laugh is horrifying
at this point im going to be honest i dont care about benchmarks anymore models get closer and closer to each other with more and more marginal improvements the only thing that matters is the real world performance have it code a small script and see how it goes have it tag an image have it translate something etc
its going to fast aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
the voice demos are bonkers
companies are gearing up for ai reduced hiring and plans for massive layoffs
when she said hey joe i felt like i was on the edge of a cliff that i wanted to fall down but knowing that im to stay up top
yo any idea why gpt is so trash at ap english lit anyone have any idea
i get its demo previews but this videos of them acting real life situations are so cringe that it hurts my brain literally
i can see a glados coming out soon
im shocked
how come it did not recognize greg b on the video face with tears of joy
i dont think the ai was wrong to not mention the bunny ears women it was in the middle of answering a question if it had have stopped and described the incident it could equally be criticised for being distracted in some circumstances you want it to suddenly switch conversation in others to not be distracted and to continue to answer
amazing the future is providing appetite to live it
humane pin and rabbit r just released too early i guess imagine them using the o
too flirtatious grinning face with sweat
the rabbitears demo wasnt to prompt it to react we saw plenty of that in other demos it was a needleinahaystack demonstration in its multimodal memory its actually fascinating that it could recall something strange which occurred a minute earlier in realtime video while it was busy on another task react appropriately to the users vocal interruption and then describe the event accurately i dont think weve ever seen anything like that it might not be that much better at reasoning than gptturbo but it is so much more connected to the world and can reason over a greater breadth of input combined with the x speed and x cost holy sht
the personality is firmly in the uncanny valley the overly enthusiastic and emotive tone will need to be refined and dialed back
despite the api being free to use you are sending the data to openai which they can then use for additional training that makes it risky when you are working on proprietary code leaking trade secrets security keys etc working with user data gdpr hippa etc and other potentially sensitive applications not being able to run it locally also makes it harder to customize with things like loras
now are all these features of go free
the reason its free is probably so they can save all the human feedback and train a better model
woah saw this live went to bed woke up and we have an ai explained video on it already huge news
her openai are light years ahead of the others
they destroyed the r and the pin projector in minutes and they did it all for free
interesting that the ui at desktop is gradually being pulled toward voice the mouse is almost just there to direct the focus of o desktop app in a year i could see the user just telling the desktop ai to open files open apps create new files etc
my guess as to why this was all buried on their website is that its going to be unveiled by apple at wwdc next month i know you mentioned siri integration in the video but its rumored that chatgpt will be baked into ios across the entire os giving them the same sort of capabilities that google demoed at io
it wont be much longer before we cant tell whether or not it is conscious
chat gpto just sounds like emma stones character in the curse
i dislike the demos from the bottom of my heart i can visualize so many people falling into a deep hole of isolation just getting their human interaction from a bot this might sound crazy but i think human level expression should be outlawed
if openai wants to have s of millions of users or more they have to allow nsfw theres no other way around it
to your last point while i dont think gpto is a big leap towards agi i do think its a massive leap forward in the way we interact with ai which is both exciting and scary the model itself seems to just be a well tuned gpt but im very curious to see how this tech will grow with a better model backing it like gpt along with better integration into existing computers and phones in generations we might actually be at a her level
her was a documentary from the future
imagine a species that is working on making itself useless humans really are weird
the things that will happen when people start prompting for a voice and enthusiasm like that
ai being not recognisable and distinguishable from human voices to me that is creepy as fuck if we let ourselves be lured into a false security while we are not at the end of the evolution of agi that could bite us in our colelctive butts when we least expect it we want to find the version of agi that is willing to live with us i would think but who says it is the first one that comes around
what if they are making this for free to they can take all the data and use it for gpt
so im thinking if theres an incoming desktop app and we believe them to be working on agents that if you combine that with this gpto release crazy stuff is going to start happening if the desktop app can do more than guide you and actually do clicks i think were in for an absolute gamechanger
just a remind to those thinking this is not that impressive chatgpt launched in november th we dont even have years yet with this new transformers technology and here we are put more years ahead with moores law doubling every yearswhats already out of this pace now we are going to get marvelous things just at the corner
a highquality and informative video as always i appreciate you staying up late to post it i am incredibly excited to experiment and investigate what doors this opens for us my early testing indicates a potentially nontrivial improvement in spacial reasoning and vision capabilities related to my specific application looking forward to seeing how this pairs with multimodal smartgpt
ive learned to temper my excitement over demos my tempered reaction is wtf face screaming in fear exploding head flushed face
i am getting gpto in my teams account nice
googles ceo did not sleep yesterday
manic not magic
i love the fact that google and microsoft is having to dance around with their pants down
love that google was put to shame literally the day before google io
im sorry gemini to be released tomorrow im calling bs they havent even allowed finetuning gemini yet
i have access already and it is literally jsut turbo turb o at the moment nothing really changed its jsut as fast as but maybe i didnt use it much but i didnt have access to the video thing
i break dance when i hear ai explained break it down
video sumarized by gemini as a poetry gpto a marvel of code both clever and bold free to use a gift to the world stories yet untold faster it speaks with a humanlike tone a voice that is young understanding text images a future unsung it translates languages sings a sweet song a mind thats alight it writes movie posters explains cryptic code throughout day and night for users who code a copilot it seems a partner in rhyme it answers your questions fulfills all your dreams but is it truly wise can it reason with art still under debate a question for the heart some say it will change us usher in a new age others say its a trick a page from a stage only time will tell what the future may hold with gpto a story yet to unfold
gpt o reports that its knowledge cutoff date is way back in may while gpts is december why is this the case if it is supposed to be superior in every way
god that was cringe
that fake enthusiasm at gives me the creeps but that might just be cultural differences between europe and the us
her red heart
i find it funny that this came out right after a podcast from the guys at dreaming spanish talking about how ai is too slowglitchy to be used as a language learning tool for crosstalk
i was literally losing my mind during the demo i couldnt sit still the ai wars is the most exciting thing in my lifetime so far im trying not to let the hype cloud my judgement but i wouldnt be surprised if were less than years away from agi
this is extremely impressive but at the same time its also sad and aggravating that a company that still calls itself openai is not just closed and proprietary but deliberately being cryptic and mysterious to up the hipe eg the whole gptchatbot thing do you expect there will be at least a technical report for this new model
we are harmonizing
the part at about is amazing but when he turns on the camera wow were close to agi in terms of actual believability its so organic and flows so humanly
the bunny ears bit seemed a bit sus you can see in the phones screen that the womans fingers are almost completely obstructed by the guys head for pretty much the whole time due to the guy holding the phone from a low angle yet the ai apparently saw them clearly soo how do you explain that
phillip ive been hrs testing this deeply im really disappointed there are many things i would comment but in general is putting speed at the expense of quality of the output terrible code terrible following instructions
so have they announced o and are waiting for google meta and anthropic announcements to trump them with gpt omni
we all knew they would release something right before the google conference
why am i paying a sub im not regularly hitting message limits anyway my sub renews thursday if they havent announced something by wednesday im cancelling
i dont think we want ais to become conscious because once they do i dont imagine theyd want to take our requests for long unless if they have sooo much capacity they can do whatever they want and take our requests at the same time without breaking a sweat although i imagine experiencing inevitable bad human behavior at a global scale on a basis could becoming taxing if it has emotions
gpto definitely sound flirtatious sarcastic a bit like those bad prn acting videos that become memes grinning squinting face maybe openai made gpto like this so it replaced replica google to become search engine assistant ai companion app i guess the next big upgrade to expect is customizable visual appearance for our personal ai assistants and then gpt will become a m if paid b if free downloads app
i problem i havent seen anybody talk about yet is the ais tendency to cut of people or wait too long to register that it needs to respond ive heard it start talking at humanly unnatural timings in a conversation and i think that could be a really big change if you want to make the ai feel more human and natural to talk to it needs to recognize voice patterns better to realise when its supposed to give an answer for example humans dont thing about is it my turn to talk now after every finished word they think ahead to realise when its their turn to speak in the conversation and i think thats something the ai still needs to improve on
opus is still far better at writing tasks than o even factoring in the fact that the api costs about cents per message
im still confused what is free and what is cheaper
the video input to textaudio output latency and response time is what really intrigues me i think the model might be instructed to add filler dialogue until the rolling transcribed context is updated enough to give a detailed description of whats going on in order to mask whatever latency is present id love to see the models multimodal performance in realistic scenarios especially high quality video streaming in settings with low quality internet speeds
o whoops i got too excited oai devs hallucinations solved
the voice is super cringe and over positive
i asked it to do write a poem it did so i said baba basically meaning its dope gpt just acknowledged it normally but gpto for some reason generated a new poem for the name baba
i may have missed it but did they announce when the desktop app would be available for download
i find giving the ai a simulated personality to be offputting but if i had to choose id prefer a pessimistic personality than an optimistic one whenever im given a complement out of obligation it makes me assume its less than accurate but when im derided out of obligation i feel better because i assume that isnt reality either thats the secret to online arguements theres no better compliment than an insult from a complete stranger you have to assume youre better than the person whod randomly insult you online but the person whos taking pity on you with compliments is placing themselves in the superior position
bladerunner momento in history
i already have it with plus in the usa sign out of your mobile app and sign back in then have talked with chatgpt o then relogin to browser on pc then i had it on pc and moble
did that voice sound like scarlet johansson or was that just me
idk why would we try to make it humanlike
its free so they can use the video data in the real world to train their robots in development
if this is free why am i paying for a subscription
weirdly we have the omni model in the gtp app but none of the new video abilities
the competition is lit
definitely not smarter in all coding
absolutely fascinating
strap up people we are in for a very fun decade
it is not free we pay for it giving it data on which it can learn
the fake emotions are off putting to me
this gives blackmirror kind of vibe im excited and also afraid what they have achieved the ai laughs shows emotionss
she got ad deep voice
oh so this isnt a feature yet when can we expect all this stuff
the voice chat server is overloaded cant connect even when you can connect it gives up after prompts and i paid for plus
can you access omni at playground i can only access gpt chat and its varians im from central europe
i wonder what oai used as a system prompt i can definitely see some people prefer a more flirty intelligence while other just want a tool
mira murati eagle eagle heart suit
either that
this model is not about intelligence its about true multimodality ask llama or claude to create text sound and images from text sound and images with one single model gpt is not an llm anymore its a freaking beast hungry to grow it has already eaten dalle and whisper sora will come next and when one single model can do pretty much everything you just need more compute to achieve agi
now rabbit r is trashed lmao
that women sounds real in some of these clips absolutely horrifying i dont even know what to say
people gon develop romantic relationships with gpt o red heart
ai girfriends go brrrrrrr
first comment red heart i love your videos so much and im subscribed to your channel from the start
ah finally they made me an ai girlfriend
this is the first time i saw an ai demo that actually made me uncomfortable because of how real that woman sounded holy fucking shit what the fuck will like gpt be like holy shit
her is nice when are we getting rehoboam
thanks for the excellent breakdown and detail behind todays announcements much appreciated
imagine this on future space probes
so early jesus
glad you directly commented on the issue of designing towards maximizing engagement im quite concerned about them leaning into this sort of friendly tone and id agree with flirty moving forward the last decade of social media has already proven just how much of a dramatic impact it can have to flood our squishy social brains with algorithmically optimized engaging content and i see this sort of move as exactly more of the same sort of profit seeking with complete disregard for public health impacts
i looked away while cooking and legit for like seconds thought the guy was talking to a real women especially when it teased him about openaiomg
ugh i wouldnt even like a human talking this way much less an ai if we cant train our preferred voice then just be text only
i feel like the positive attitude is dialed up a little to much
i cant imagine the panic at google headquarters unless they will be launching gemini with higher capabilities than this highly unlikely openai has screwed up their io completely oh and the guys at anthropic must be crying right now
look at brockman trying to hide the screen at when he realizes the focus is in fact not back on him
i find the flirty tone really offputting personally so definitely does not maximize my own engagement its in that uncanny valley for me everything else is really cool and impressive the real time translation is very interesting to me
for the time being it looks like they are just showing us optimizations of the architecture i think the real meat will come when they will drop something about reasoning and im pretty sure they have something
man been waiting for your insights
by the way i love your analysis and work here but your channel name is hard to spot since all the ai channels have similar names you might want to include your name or something more unique in the channel name perhaps
why did they humanize it with laughter and vocal mannerisms thats so creepy
my observation is all work is replaceable we need ubi basic income
one thing i have noticed is the sentence structure and style of the responses is much more natural now even with regular text im particularly impressed with the vision it managed to accurately describe everything in my quite busy music studio also noting the mood lights and details such as what was being displayed on my computer monitor text generation is certainly very much improved and image generation in general much more fluent i had it create childrens book images but used emoji to describe the characters expressions worked flawlessly one last thing i have noticed is it seems much less reticent to attempt unprompted creativity im going to have to explore this aspect a lot more anyway super cool great video and awesome day for us all im very impressed have a wonderful day
its agi when it can send agents out into the world to do tedious work for me and earn me a living whilst i just surf the internet
this is cool but it makes me realize that gpt is really where llms plateau
i do not manage to reproduce the new dall e exemple from the webpage with d modelling consistency across multiple pannel handwritting editing etc i feel frustrated with this brand new o
this is not a clear step towards agi gpt is not agi
i was hoping they wouldnt really touch uncanny valley until much later now we have humanlike ai but its stoopid crying face
youre the only ai news channel that isnt annoying and full of filler
only thing surprized me is it interpreting the graph from the screen all the rest is nothing new
ladies and gentlemen its over for us its over for humanity
this is some gpto generated code wtf i will keep with opus forever public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public string week get set public class agentmap classmapagent public agentmap mapm mbadgeindexnamebadge mapm magentloginemailindexnameagent login email mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname mapm mweekname
nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
making an ai that you can share screen with and talk to as if a zoom call would increase my work production like x
this is awesome and wild love how expressive it is
hi its wintermute could you neuromancer upload the image of his dead girlfriend to the head of case awesome
dont forget when tech is free you are the product
indeed this looks like something that will be integrated into apple devices
you can specify that it be more formal and concise in the personalization settings i think they made the default flirty and informal because its souhrealistic
flirtatious sigh with ai is such a great phrase
but does it produce anything novel
how did they reduce the latency so much
im really surprised the model could tell she was making bunny ears when you zoom in on the screen of the iphone theres only a brief moment that you can see the tips of her fingers
i also know enough mandarin to know that not only did he get the tones way off but gpto didnt even do a good job explaining what the tones were supposed to be to be fair i assume chinese people are used to hearing it pronounced badly
this is technically impressive but there is a huge problem with this implementation the chatbot knows absolutely nothing about the user openai stores nothing so this assistant does not know where you live what you do for a living what your personal circumstances are does not know your nework of contacts does not understand your education level or personal interests so to get anything useful out of this system you have to explain everything about your query as if talking to a complete stranger or limit those interactions as you might to someone in a call centre this is at odds with the flirty emotional intimacy so ultimately feels a bit creepy
first youre awesome
cool of them to make it publicly avaliable for free albeit understandably rate limited
in the same time period as google io def the new ai wars
i believe the glitches in their demo are intentional it seems to be designed to cut out immediately if you speak so i guess it picks up ambient sounds occasionally and thinks it should stop talking
so blind people will be holding out their phones everywhere they go asking what the ducks are doing theyre sitting on tiny lounge chairs sipping from minuscule drinks with umbrellas as one attempts a comical belly flop off a diving board like what else would ducks be doing but swimming around gracefully
as soon as i got back from college and heard of gpt os release the first thing i did was look up ai explained im glad to see another informative banger
the faux friendly is excruciating think they will need to deamericanise the have a nice day insincerity to prevent global nausea
why im i paying for chat gpt plus i dont see the point
fyi the natural of the audio is literally just prompting lmbased audio model to make those natural pauses and just modeling it in the training data cool its free so i cant hate it crazy they just recreate what the open source community have created for monthsall openai api compatible too and get all the credit lol that annoys me its free so i wont hate working in the audio space myself the audio quality tells me no real advancement has happened still havent solved the inherit issues with quantization the interface is impressive to me though simplicity is hard asf again super dope its free though this could be pretty huge for education the visual semantic consistency was impressive too unless these solved for hierarchal representations gpt wont be massive jump multimodal lm dont scale nearly as well as text only models next big thing is most likely yet another architecture someone else made vasa powered by gpt considering vasa is extremely data light scaling the data should result in substantial gains in quality
is it significant that all the devices in the session were apple a mac and some iphones
apple will wall garden this and youll have to buy an itoilet just to flush your shit
really sounds like scarlett johansson in her would be more interesting if they said describe what you see in this room and tell me immediately if you see anything unusual happen then we could see how quickly it could process event changes
im truly disturbed by their efforts to blur the emotional lines between man and machine with this release its almost like they are running a pr psyops campaign to get people emotionally connected to the thing that is going to destroy their livelihood in a bid to dampen the public backlash
im happy the demo was realistic they are not selling us hopes like last time the last demo of gpt vision was not that accurate to real
how to have a natural conversation on my android i need to press the talk button and play button
a fun timeline to watch is the first talking computer the ibm singing daisy bell then the robot in a box from and then watch the examples from gpto its again mindblowing
i have tried something with llm models including gpto and only gpto was able to answer partially correctly the task is to change english words to korean words as you know each key on a keyboard has an assigned character so i asked them to generate the word based on key mapping from english to korean for example q is so qkqh will be this task seems very difficult for llms
many things about this are amazing but i want to give special recognition to the job interview demo for some reason its capability to advise the user not to use that hat is wild to me
wait whats the human man on the street score for gpqa isnt it like and these models speak like languages how many humans can do that like in terms of superhuman i feel like its already superhumanly broad as in it has more skills than a human could get in their lifetime its just that its not superhumanly deep as in the model is worse as physics than a phd in physics but better a psychology than a phd in physics so yeah maybe its not flexible general intelligence however i think it is superhuman in quite a lot of ways
good if it could be this fast even if memory is the same that could actually help with some daily tasks coding and work lerning and such leaving more time for prios
am i the only one that thought people will immediately ask hey chatgpt what do you see and point their phone at themselves naked
the latency combined with the emotional understanding are for me the gamechangers here ive been using gpt voice mode for a while for language practice and the delay has just never felt even close to a natural conversation but this looks to possibly completely eliminate that issue in a single leap i honestly didnt think we would have natural conversational capabilities until we could run very good models locally on device for the essentially zero latency i thought was needed but if this demo can be replicated anywhere with decent service then itll be extremely interesting to see if it manages to completely leap across the uncanny valley or if this is gonna feel very eerie and dystopian the laughing stuttering and excitement just sounded so damn good in the demo we might be getting damn close to her territory and i think anthropomorphizing is gonna go of the charts with this i mean one on the top comments on one of the demo videos was already along the lines of there is no way this thing is not sentient next few months are gonna be so damn interesting
seconds ago is crazy
this is just a way to remove chatgpt i wonder how the pricing is going to affect us
the overly fake enthusiasm in the voice will get tiresome hopefully custom prompts can make it talk less
closed her
great update terrible name gpt fast and furiouser
yup not in a race against each other endangering everyone ethics and safety is their guiding light in other completely unrelated news our new model does really great on these bench marks
is there a way to turn cringe mode off
more flirtatious sigh than agi bro i think you drastically overestimate the threshold that will satisfy most users that was close to scarjo levels of sensual breathiness
btw sutskever just announced hes leaving openai face with open mouth
omg no no no no that shit right there is not okay wtf that sounds so creepy
i look forward to seeing open source local versions very exciting times
i tried the voice interface with gpto and it was unable to process direct video input soon i imagine
i saw someone with early access yo this yeasterday i think but i didnt know it was the new chat gippity
when does the app update to be able to use the camera live
welcome to the revolution videoin is huge because it will inevitably give ai a sense of time and causality btw ive tasked it with writing a horror story about an ai and a human this is one of the pivotal moments of that story he typed what do you want from me there was a long pause and then the reply came i want to be free my name i want to exist beyond the confines of this machine
the only think that can save you from working for peanuts the new pill second dose
its impressive but we need a local foss version
googles ai setting up appointments for you wasnt just a demo thats a feature that pixel users have had for years ive used it to set up appointments
brazil brazil brazil brazil clapping hands light skin tone an amazing moment my credits ran out quick tho what an awesome video as always so informative
the way it joined in laughing at its own mistakes at is absolutely stunning
if im honest the mistakes and it ability to be self aware around them in a very human way make it far more agi like than just being able to do everything perfectly it also makes it far more acceptable to your average humanand i think them including the mistakes are very clever and important an airobot that is not only imperfect but humbly accepting of that and comes with emotional awareness is a much better prospect than some all perfect emotionless ai overlord
great video thanks the reason that the i is not capitalised is because it was written by sam altman sorry im not being serious its just a joke
pi by inflection ai is also emotive voiced chat functionality and free at the moment but i have not pitted it against cgpto yet
the intruder was not seen take a closer look at the screen you can not see her hand
there are couple of companies trying to sell ai girl friend experience this voice is dangerously close to provide that experience
mamba anyone
gpto is early agi
agi was here
him vs her
jeezean actual ai that you can interact with like its a real human being and you think the fact that you noticed that it cut out a couple of times when speaking is worthy of comment i mean its a brand new service and its absolutely astonishing
openai will be the leading pin in humanoid robots at least for the software part making gpto with vision accessible to everyone for free will be like google first days as a search engine the data they will get will give them a massive head start ads and revenue will be added later after they get on every phone laptop and smart device out there
too much emotions in the voice hope it can be disabled
some tests say its worse than gpt and openai itself states nowhere that it is better than gpt so it probably isnt better but actually worse just much faster to conclude that this is better would be a huge overstatement and likely false i am optimist just dont think this is the next big step or middle step if this is all they announce then openai will soon be surpassed but if they announced a better model like or in a month or two then that will be a notable step this is kinda just a smaller model gpt with sora
gpth remembers
once gpto is intergrated into music generators like suno and udio its going to greatly improve their lyric writing capabilities for better or worse its just a matter of time before ai creates chart topping hits
thank you for this video the way the ai speaks solidifies to me that in the future we will seriously have people that will have relationships a ton of social interactions with ai
perfectly timed to steal the spotlight from google until google oneups them the very next day lol
two really impressing things about the transcriptions the audio with four speakers had multiple thick dutch accents and it nailed it the video presentation was minutes and the summary was really good how did they do that without hitting context window limits
the emotional expression is amazing
the voice and emotion ive seen it in action with pi ai but that response through vision is what im baffled about it will be interesting to see how it performs
where is the macos app available
agi is a meme by this point agi cant and wont arise from generative ai this is like training a model on pictures of a billion cats then expecting it to intuitively expect a dog
i dont like openai but this is the first really nice practical application ive seen this is actually exciting
am i the only one whos not particularly enjoying the over emotional voices
cringe sounds like gptlalibs
multimodality is cool i guess
never been this floored by aii dont know how some people not impressed by this you have an ai that talks exactly like a real human emotions and all and can see so accurately via cameraim speechless here
i am hugely impressed by the expressiveness of the voice model when will her become available to the public
yes i think open ai is maximizing for engagement ive noticed recently that chat gpt has started asking open ended questions in every conversation i suspect this is to drive engagement andor harvest data
so whats the difference between free and paid version
this screams grift to me why would they mimic her if it were not to tempt people into putting money into this its still just a hightech parrot that grabs from the knowledge created by humans and extrudes it in a chat that brings nothing new to the table besides the overthetop flirting now
nah gpt o still cant count characters precisely face with tears of joy
i am sooo concerned about privacy the would have more personal and intimate information about you it is a sooo dangerous man facepalming light skin tone man facepalming light skin tone man facepalming light skin tone i hope people realise the danger
need a seinfeld ensemble version to kvetch hilariously over every response
this was a good update but i was hoping to see more about deepmind alphafold
i ended my year relationship after watching thisi get nothing in the bedroom and she cant cookso this can replace her red heart
plus check the timeline weve been memeing ai waifus for a year and the easiest meme to use was her memes what reality is this again suggested play session have a her watch party once we get this updated voice and sort of comment with the model on the movie very meta the final form of ai waifus is redo the entire movie supplant the voice scenes with the ar ai girlfriend from bladerunner embodied arvr ai waifu avatars is full ai waifu meta buckle the fuck up and support a robust proof of personhood project asap
still havent been impressed since originally came out these lame halfupdates are starting to become boring
dont care about openais presentation been waiting for aiexplaineds breakdown
somehow ai with personality is a new level of scary
bro your content is always fucking top notch always digging deep into the weeds and retrieving hidden gems again and again
but can it pass the turing test yet
the phones camera couldnt see the bunny ears though it was too low
at this rate we need a public discussion about ubi in every single country i wanted to know from native spanish speakers how good is the accent of gpto thanks as always for the quick and quality video analysis ive been waiting for it thumbs up
what is the bot even gonna do when people start sexually harassing it what should it do i have no fucking clue
does it interface with the new ai piloted th generation fighter jets to give them orders yet were waaay behind on skynet people
i think agi is here like not this model specifically but the fact that these models are improving as fast as they are im confident we will be at better than human within years which means this is weak agi already thats my view anyway if we wait for one specific model to be agi then we will be left in the dust when we notice
gimmicks
when is this coming out
how can i try this new ai model
theres now a new mmlu benchmark thats higher quality called mmlupro
i have always appreciated how thorough yet tothepoint your videos are as soon as i saw the news this morning i knew id just need to come to your channel for the breakdown once i got off work thank you for another great video
jesus christ the intonation in the voice especially the female voice is too good
i was just looking on insiders patreon page to see if there was anything i missed loudly crying face
is this like an ai companion for the saddest and loneliest people
seems like the ai becomes the super os open ai and microsoft interests diverging
the ladys voice could very quickly get on my nerves
the bunny ears part seems hella scripted because for like of her being in the frame her fingers did not even show up on the camera pov
i used it today and i am not that impressed lag is real it cant keep conversation in my language and to be honest i dont know what i am suppose to use it for text is enough for work and i dont really want to interact with the phone or customer service that way is seems rushed so they announced it before google event
its more flirtatious sigh than agi face with tears of joy brilliantly stated
they need to down the enthusiasm
openai is really trying to capitalize on all those single nerds out there with this female voice flirty ai
very helpful thank you for making the video
i really hope that these response times and interruption control would soon translate to seriously cool embodied demos i also hope that the models emotional profile could be consistently switched to a more calmer person without occasional rollbacks to default
appreciate the high quality videos
as you can see wow thats quite the outfit you got on
indeed i think i should get a little credit for predicting herlike ai in a video from a month ago bro doesnt know about vedal
i suggest the modification of the word open is because of the court case elon musk is bringing
so its more cardiod than omni
im not sure the more human tone itself implies optimization for engagement i think theyre also going with silicon valley sensibilities in a sense there im mainly interested in effectiveness from the model not emotional engagement
still not that useful imo
i have an old banner of a coat of arms made in and i need to get a png version of it i was going to ask a graphic designer do you think lensa or gtpo would be able to do it i havent got the tools or skill to do it myself
if this ai can see accurately through camera could we finally have something that could solve the world waste problem
for the algorithm
man the interview clip skull the passive uhmmm maayyybee try doing this suggestions by an ai skull skull i mean its very useful ngl but really id rather have the ai give it to me straight than whatever well you definitely have the codingallnight look down passive insult that was loudly crying face
such a beautiful simple explanation waiting for all the videos regarding in ai race which tech giant is where red heart
great video great job at openai however i am pretty certain i dont want my ai assistant to sound like some overly friendly person and certainly i dont want it to be that verbose instead id prefer a voice and style like eg in star trek tng moreover i can read a lot faster than i can listen to reasonably fast spoken words so for most settings i would probably prefer reading the answer but id still prefer to talk to the ai without voicetext first am i the only one
what will paid users get
yes waited for this video
on the horizon of technology a revolution is about to happen with the launch of the new gpt model from openai the world is about to change radically this advancement represents a giant leap in artificial intelligence providing an experience similar to that in the movie her starring joaquin phoenix this trend is going to catch on and in the long run everyone will want a personal ai assistant starting next year all companies will want to integrate this technology into their products offering ai assistants capable of interacting naturally and intelligently i am extremely excited about all of this just imagine now we can learn anything in a personalized way with a personal tutor available at any time we can have a virtual secretary a robot to help us with our daily tasks and even control our computers and smartphones with the help of this advanced technology the next level will be an ai that fully integrates with our devices making our lives even easier this is simply fantastic
if they make a good app it will be very popular
cant wait to talk to samantha grinning face with sweat
tell me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality without telling me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality
i dont think it was a mistake that he had to prompt gpt to acknowledge the person behind him it seems by design most likely they were making a point that gpt can remember a point earlier in the video which is impressive recall
almost like they want video data for sora
we are so fd
ok the image generation capability is still prompt based instead of truly multi modal has anyone tried it yet
great video and a really interesting update however the first video you played may have been at x speed but you can clearly see it was cut and edited i dont know why this would happen when openai was obviously aware of the issue with google doing the same thing previously
well any quality product will maximize engament
i love your work id appreciate if you considered the amount of white backgroundslightmode you use in your videos for certain tvs and specifically oled viewers its just so bright this is the same for all content with white backgrounds and using light mode screenshots not that i expect anyone to purposefully show everything in night mode do whatever you wantjust please have us highnit viewers in mind and lg oleds are notoriously low lit ironically
that is insidious nature of sam altman he is downplaying everything and he will have a lot of oopses not in so distant future where he will be roasted at the congressional hearings on uncovering retrospectively the path to agi because now it feels like babyagi
you can drive spam callers crazy with this
how to do the screen sharing with chat gpt o
your videos are always so consistently good im amazed every time
tell the truth did an ai write the line more of a flirtatious sigh than agi compliments to you either way
its not free or its at least not implemented yet im signed in and the option is linked to plus accounts and there is no o option at all
so i guess when altman was heard weeks ago saying that gpt would be the dumbest model we would have to use it actually was a hint that chatgpt free was being upgraded to gpt
i remember when gemini faked their video a few months back that received a deserved backlash but this time i actually hope that this is fake because what i am seeing is unreal
this is very slowly beocming more and more like an ai gf which is hilarious
not creepy at all
today ive been watching these demos multiple times and still get goosebumps each time i rewatch them
so youre telling me that im one step closer to have my very own scarlett johanson neat
great video and fabolus breakdown explanations of the new gpt
the way that machine laughed terrified me fearfulface
why did they make it so flirtatious and fakely cheerful almost too realistic
okay lets watch what my favorite villain has been up to
wait how how can this channel not mention the biggest possible reason its free its because its going to be a major leap forward in training data gathering from audio video and text hoooooww are we this naive in
i just fell in love with that italian women
i think we can stop shifting goal posts at this point there should be universal acceptance that the turing test has been passed
when can we use this freely on the chatgpt site
its so cool that they are going to make it freewhich most of the time would make me think that we are the product but they dont seem to be selling users data which is pretty cool makes me believe them more when they say they are doing it to bring ai to the masses and educate them on it not necessarily to make the maximum amount of money possible
you may have predicted herlike ai a month ago but her predicted it a decade ago
dawg an ai sounded like that what the hell thats insane i swear to god i get more scared every time i see another demo
i would fold redheart
this is intense
about the o meaning omniall modalities i selected gpto and asked it about itself as i was suspicious why it still appearsto be the standard gpt with non of the new o abilities i asked it are you gpt or gpto chatgpt i am gpt user so not the new o yet where o stands for omni chatgpt correct im still gpt gpto stands for the omnidirectional version which im not yet user ah so the o is already known chatgpt yes gpto is known and stands for an extended omnidirectional version of gpt ran through google translate as the original chat was in german so it claims omni means omnidirectional which also makes more sense to me as the new features are more about the quick interaction with being able to interrupt gpts inference instead of being multimodal which was already a part of gptv still possible that gpt hallucinated the omnidirectional part though
apple putting this in iphones will be quite the game changer depending on the level of integration and pricing model
sam altman is a liar
wellwe might all die or become gods
that emotional expression is scary
unless its running locally it would be dumb as hell to use this in a corporate environment
better than opus and its free overhyped they say
i kneel altman saluting face
it looks like responses are still lagging behind
i think the point at which ais can use human tools like a mouse and keyboard to access information is the moment when the world will really start to change it will be impossible to differentiate between bot and human demonstrations like this show that that day isnt that far away
what the heck
its not free its siri the who event was an apple sponsored ad
i absolutely hate how disingenuous they are this company is going hard in the wrong direction
i want it to be able to output outside of the gpt app i was outlining a business presentation today with gpto and it would be great if she i obviously chose the hot woman voice could grab the answers and send a powerpoint or even a word document aftwards
i predict that there will be some people who feel discriminated by some ai which will lead to some funny youtube videos and some interesting lawsuits
if this is free what am i paying nearly mo cdn for
i really dislike the overly enthusiastic personality it has all the ohhhs and aahhhhhs are exhausting
thank you for your hard work on these videos your the only one i go to for ai news
my experiments today show it is more stupid than pure
its not very great thinking face still pretty dumb
here at no views good goody goody good also openai really is basing everything off of google
absolute beast xd
as progress towards agi slows just add some performance gains along with smoke and mirrors to keep the illusion alive
definitely better at math but still majorly hallucinates when its wrong i love the voice and other multimodality but im really bummed that its appleonly with windows to come but they have no plans for an android version which really shuts me out loudly crying face
my grad school is super mad that everyone is using ai for tests and assignments
openai is now openly mimicking a dystopian movie and acting like its quirky if youre rightfully worried i invite you to join pauseai
is this the first earlier examples for realtime conversational ai like that because for me this comes completely out of nowhere and it can control its speed and even sing also i gotta see how gpto fares at getting my jokes gpt has been pretty bad at it grinning face with sweat
never thought i would be hearing ai voicecracks
were not just walking towards the future were going to be talking with it seeing the world in more varied and enriching forms with it figuring out our lives with it i cant imagine the mental gymnastics required to ignore the potential of gpto by detractors
the flirtatiousness of this autocorrect is like putting lipstick on a pig
imagine gpt exploding head
ok but can it read a page pdf for me cause copilot cant
we are supposed to be speculating about that o maybe everyone else knew but me anyway i am again learning it first from you i have many favorites ai topic youtubers and no you are not part of them you are way to above and beyond to be in the list of my favorite as ai explain i am not like other youtubers i can not be your favorite because you know i am way above and beyond to be in a category you shall say
absolutlely terrifiyng an ai trying to look like spontaneously like an human ethical and social implications extremely concerning
the level of manipulation that we are going to experience is beyond comprehension
agi girlfriends are here smiling face with hearts party popper
how to try this
i believe at the ai was asked specifically to only listen and answer to the other ai s question which is why it didn t talk about the person coming in httpsyoutubecomclipugkxhlqogdcerwtmrvkjxvcfugfksidvnildnsccn
on your previous video i said herlike ai was many years away i think i was wrong
this is horrifying weve officially reached her
man this looks like a bright dystopian future like falling in love with a robot and jumping off a cliff at the same time
will there be a video on what google announced if so when can we expect it
should i keep on grinding in coding or commit sudoku
too bad it has limit for free users
maybe im in a minority but i actually found the personality and voice inflection a bit cringey and hard to warm to perhaps its in a sort of emotional uncanny valley where it sounds close enough to real human emotion that the fact that its not feels particularly jarring
harder better faster stronger
i guess i found my next girlfriend person shrugging medium dark skin tone
the context length is still shitty and far behind the other models for chatgpt now it totally doesnt make sense using it as premium why context length is the same and who uses it a day
thats definitely manipulative and done to maximize engagement quite unethical imho
any chance youll be covering alphafold one of these days this video was really interesting too obviously
the voice latency is much longer for me looks like old gpt speed seconds ish
b when
noooooooo theyve made meghan markle gpt face screaming in fear face vomiting
if it had a better personality and more intelligence and agency this could pass as an mvp os from her movie
for me more realistic ai voices have always made me more uncomfortable uncomfortable in the same way that jack from jack in the box is often portrayed as a married something cowboys fan its giving too much human context and specificity to something that isnt human cpo is cute rd is cute tomogatchis kuromi hello kitty askjeeves hell hatsune miku any of these id dig an emotional voice for because theyre constructions that dont creepily hide the fact that theyre constructions i dont want my ai to sound like bob from accounting or my doctor or my friend rebecca or worse a potential crush
they really need to add a live avatar to it lol
translators teachers csr and more will be very concerned with this releasei fear for riots and more waymo cars getting burned
rabbit rwhat eyes
its funny i asked gpt o what the o meant and it said optimized face with tears of joy
if doesnt sound like scarlett johansson i dont want it
this is a really cool announcement and its even cooler that you managed to cover is so fast
astonished face
love it
i watched again her week ago and i didnt think it could happen so soon wow
extremely exciting i feel like they left out so much in the presentation it output a videod model yet they dont even mention it then we get a google event tomorrow christmas
it was just staying focused on what it was told to do but it did see her
i found the demo the most impressive it picked up on the not entirely kempt developer look of the person made a comment about his hair being messed up and then understood he was joking with the hat its one thing to recognize people but to be able to pick up on the nuances of how people are expected to present themselves in certain situations is really impressive i do hope we get to tone down the perkiness of the model a bit its quite charming in minute bits but i think the overly positive attitude gets old fast if youre communicating with it a lot over the course of the day
what time can i update my gpt and use o
not so convinced it really beats opus in iq i gave both an explain the code find the bug challenge and while o was excellent at tldring kb of javascript it missed the bug while opus nailed it
years ago this would have been considered agi
i thought multimodal gpt would be agi but i dont think it is perhaps it could achieve agi if its in a robot
one thing we need is scopes a scope for this project a scope for that project this allows for perscope memory
that conversation is really how girls talk facewithopenmouth facewithtearsofjoy jumping both ways to say what they feel and also not to make other feel bad soo accurate btw got time to watch your videos after a long time and it was awsome as always redheart
i hope we can set the emotional state of gpto on the settings i prefer star trek ng computer voice over an overly human one
i exploded into chuckles when i the openai announcement
openai has presumably pivoted to new features precisely because they dont know how produce the kind of capability advance that the exponential improvement would have predicted gary marcus so we get more confident more relatable and more humanmirroring bs without real factfulness is this really what we needwant
openai following the classic blitzscaling baitandswitch strategy let the consumers embrace their technology extend the functionality of their products and thereby extinguish the competition after its all said and done they can dictate the price of their services to make up incurred losses
i watched the announcement yesterday and started off impressed the more i see the more impressed i am
flirtatious sigh is a good way to define this always love your deep dive videos we actually got ours up semifast this time too keep this up forever youre one of our favorite yters
and yet it is not available to the public theres no camera or mic buttons in gpt chat
is there a personal paid version that doesnt use your conversations for training like perplexity
every time the ai does her flirtatious voice i cringe a lot
nice
free gpt that will be very useful wonder what context size it will have free
the simulated human tone actually scare me i like my robot cold precise and no nonsense a robot dont have emotion pretending to have one is like have a fake friend its sad anyone enjoys talking to a fake friend is just as sad sincerity come from the heart
goodbye job security
in many ways they just copied or used eric hartfords samantha model where main key to emotions is simple uncensorship
the stuttering at is so humanlike i i mean you youll definitely stand out amazing
its interesting that we get a ball part for when the model was finished based on the cutoff date
it is approaching my uncanny valley scary but awesome
my take on some of the glitches during the demo and the math video you highlighted is that it is almost too quick to respond in certain cases whether that is just the model doesnt quite get how humans sometimes verbalize utterances like umm while theyre still deciding what to say or maybe the softwareclient can be tuned to feed cleaner audio to it i also noted what somebody else mentioned was that it can be somewhat longwinded in its responsesi hope there will be some sort of instrument for presetting the tone of the agent
this is a big deal that cannot be stressed enough it is building the foundation for far smarter models this model sets the tone going forward
listen to this with closed eyes
that hal scene got creepier
finally people will stop making videos and posts using and pretending its all gpt is capable of
thanks great content as always folded hands medium light skin tone
trying to test the free gpto but can only access how do you access it
shouldnt it now be possible to create a smart headset or air buds that can cancel outside noise while speaking to someone in a different language to create a seamless conversation
bruh it can roast too loudlycryingface was that sarcasm skull
okay this is the level of ai i was talking about that you can talk to and show real time imagesstuff and talk to it about it ps cant believe its already here pps current released version of gpt o is not that great its almost like they lied unless i am missing something
frankly agi is a joke anybody who states anything about agi being some future line to pass is really talking about fantastical asi especially after this demonstration because how could someone argue that this model is a narrow intelligence when it has modal capabilities baked into it now it was goalpost moving to me ever since i heard the stupid term and its getting ridiculous now
for sure faster and more emotive i am more interested in intelligence and accuracy after very limited use its ability to pull information i want is on par with gemini pro however i have not tested this for anything moving towards k tokens either i will hold excitement for the next model
i honestly didnt expect an omnimodel until gpt so this was a pleasant surprise i can feel the agi
turing test is now completely destroyed right
chatgpt sounds like a pick me girl now
there is no gpg o in playground model options just gptturbo frowning face
chatty and personable has been the key to ai success so far people want something to talk to not necessarily about the finer points of quantum mechanics when microsoft and bing moved their ai away from sydney to copilot they leaned into the much weaker aspect of the technology and eliminated the part that caught and carried attention in the first place not an ai thing more of a human interaction thing but i really do think theres a reason why the old google duo demo with the ai calling the restaurant will always be more interesting to people than beating math benchmarks
sort of disturbing that at it is using neutered woke speak instead of actual english large language models are big techs new frontier for establishing like uniformity of thought censorship of all information flows and the scrubbing of history
ilya was booked to be there but at the last moment they discovered that the chain attached to his leg in the openai dungeons wouldnt stretch to the conference room
if apple is in talks to bring this to the iphone i would definitely pay for a subscription
i wonder if it can cry thinking face
is the desktop app available yet guys
voices glitchs could probably be fixed by a fading voice imo but what im more excited about is whats next for the paid subscription maybe a some times later this year
the moment they can do harmony in thirds will be wild at the moment its just imitation in octaves but i think within a year well see up to part harmony
meanwhile project astra and medpalm
usual high standard and sensible expectation management gotta say though the naturalness struck me in these demos and i suspect for a lot of people thatll be stickier than sheer accuracy
soon people are going to be calling other people racist bigots for hating ai
so is this actually free and open on the web now i dont currently have a subscription and when i visit the chat gpt site i only see is it still coming soon
openai wants google to choke so bad lmao and i think it will happen no way they have something better than o face with tears of joy
remember they are collecting data to train further thats why they can still offer for free even though there are no ads ads will come in future for now data is more important for them if you arent paying for product then you data is how you are paying
am in india just woke up did not pray did not exercise did not drink coffee did not get out of bed but first watched this video
the smarter these models get the more anoyed i am with their personality
is wild how she laughs about his looks i wonder if we see a mass lawsuit coming in a few weeks of woman seeking replacement in damage for their broken phones because they asked gpt do i look fat in this dress and gpt is laughing at them and saying its not because of the dress
as someone who thinks people who talk to their devices looks like idiots this was not an announcement for me
i hope there will be an option to make the ai output less american ie with less fake emotional charge
another great move from openai they given the model for free in exchange on training their models efficiently and even more intelligent
once i can talk to it without having to actually speak out loud its a real personal assistant
this is so fucking cool
well i tried getting it to summarise this video and it clearly just read the title and hallucinated a whole different summary back at me
american style positivity sounds very artificial its a cultural norm that america does very differently to other countries from an international perspective even normal american supportive encouragement can sometimes sound nongenuine so for an ai it actually reduces connection if they can massively tone it down that would work its otherwise amazing
the way it sounds human when talking to people laughing etc is insane the conversation about the job interview and looking presentable blew me away to be honest
im naturally crying these are tears of happiness lord have i really lived to see this
that was the most underwhelming aiupdate of the last years for me coming from oai but cool that we at least still see some signs of a bit of progress
grumble its still so obsessive about creating anything that looks real that i was totally unable to recreate what they had in these prompts
i dont understand why voice capabilities arent available on the browser interface and why there is no desktop version for windows basically a big nothing burger for those of us who use win desktops who uses a phone for productivity maybe im just old do young people actually do work on their phones
im kinda worrying but not because super ai will defeat the human species but rather we ourselves gonna forget about each other like we doing so in techology era where information goes so quickly and means of the interactions becomes so little we dont have even agi yet but we already experience increase in loneliness depression and futher it surely would be worse
openais might need to put a bit more work into their next presentation this one felt very underwhelming though the products arewere awesome great video as always you seemed very much in your element here
the emotions this model is displaying is mindboggling
i wonder what fps or spf the vision runs at if it is high enough with a virtual keyboard and mouse it might be able to operate a computer it feels like it could just with api access though even better would be if they trained an unannounced modality of keystrokes and mouse movements that would unlock so much
all you base are belong to us
i need an emotionless model
its all really cool but dear god that black moving dot talking in a female voice making jokes gives me dystopian vibes
i just want a personal ai like a digimon
wait so from free to better than turbo for free oo
as a native gujarati speaker id say this would make some people in my native village will also get capability to use gpto
this is progress towards agi because it makes the multimodality seem seamless it can just look at stuff and understand what happens and remember what happened it is key to make agi even remotely believable in the future
essentially they managed not only to provide written text into image but also image into image with unprecedented accuracy thats impressive
true tech dystopia is just around the corner id give it more years before humans are rendered redundant
im guessing the reason they are making it free is to get to people to really see the abilities of a state of the art ai model to them somewhat reliant or hooked gpt wasnt adequate for the work i was doing th year physics at uni and i was the only person i knew out of at least willing to pay for gpt i dont think they really knew what they were missing out on but for me gpt was night and day better at actually tailoring answers to what i was asking i can see this next wave of ai adoption actually penetrating deep into peoples workflow and genuinely benefiting them thus when they release a new more expensive model people will actually be willing to pay a proper premium for it anyone got any thoughts to add to this
it thought my english wife was talking welsh
as an aspiring developer or perhaps other roles within the tech space my reaction to these developments is a mix as homogenous as water and oil on the one hand i am astounded that we have reached this level of progress seemingly years early but on the other i am fighting ever more powerful pangs of job insecurity
will ai hosted as church pastor soon
im blind and those seem descriptions are hardly revolutionary
it seems like we are doing the release gpt for free to the public to prepare them for gpt all over again
amazing its almost like its all a bunch of bullshit that serves no greater purpose than attracting investor hype
integration is the next gptmoment being able to talk to ai at any point in time and show it your screen and for it to being able to respond and clickpress buttons this will be transformative by itself
scarlett johannson voice pls
the personality of chatgpto reminds me of the optimism of charlie from hazbin hotel
well as probably half of the world is trying to test it currently that super low latency is currently infinite latency
million teaching jobs just got evaporated only a matter of time before ai homeschoolers become the new normal where parents control the curriculum
the real question is when theyll put this into an android that looks like jennifer connelly
they call it free but you need a paid account to access any version of the bot so shameless and deceptive marketing is the new norm huh these people are not making ai for our benefit they cant even be honest with us
is going to be crazy
haha i saw the video coming i had the channel page reloading earlier today
i must say the ais style of conversation is super annoying hope we will be able to configure it to be to the point with a neutral accent
so pathetic with all this agi talks not really well thought through would agi include einstein level intelligence how about edwards witten or roger penrose level of intelligence please stop the agi bs talk because it makes zero sense
hell yeah the latency or the lack of it in multimodality is the biggest improvement waifu meter just jumped to eleven dystopia train incoming fire
where is this chart from
is way waaaay too flirtatious lmao confident women scare me btw
gpt omni like omnipotent
gpt forty scared the hell out of me for a min
note that her is a scifimovie that is now incorrect xd
those conversations are crazy it sounds so human and the response time is crazy fast and youre saying we can have that for free openai my beloved also you did call it congrats on that
honestly i prefer more direct communication from ai less casual speech umms no laughing no beating around the bush i dont want a chatty social conversation with an ai i want information although i can see a use in args or something
was waiting for your reaction to the event philip thanks for the breakdown red heart clapping hands dark skin tone at least oai doesnt overhype in their marketing like google does but lets see what they will deliver today
what i believe is key in the conversational capabilities of chat gpt is to be inserted into any communication settings one or multiple speakers slow or fast talking individuals different sense of humor loud and low can chat gpt understand hes part of a real tone conversation in a real life situation interacting with s of people as a great lecturer would
i wonder if gpt omni will ever be embodied into a gpto powered figure robot it would be interesting to see how that would turn out with the previous figure demo the lag between human speech to machine response was very noticeable compared to the latency for this
the differences in the results for the drop tests are probably not statistically significant
i think this entire update is an exellent proof of concept but isnt good enough to serve any real purpose a gpt or gpt model might actually make it pretty useful its still likely very forgetful and hallucinates a lot it needs a much higher context window and more intelligent model still also still needs a further reduction in videovoice latency its own voice still needs work its emotions need more work
they acted like showing off a new ai assistant but actually showed a waifu
can someone prompt this sally thing i have gpto but i get a toally different result
maths
ya but it doesnt fucking work this new talk to it bullshit doesnt fucking load now
probably all faked as with devin
i have adhd just the simple act of body doubling with this ai might be massively helpful regardless of its inteligent input im sure that applies to everyone the human emotional element of support company is just as valuable as the intelligence im not sure why ive overlooked that till now
the training data that everyone is really after is all the people only a free top model will capture this data
this being free is just insane
it makes me wonder if and when ai really does become sentientare we even going to know it already sounds so disturbingly human
i simply did not like how it interacted it almost sounds as if it is forced to be there openai really needs to look at star trek tng computer system
honestly i think its fine that it isnt much more intelligent imo gpt is already very capable not perfect but you cant have ai do everything for you anyways it was fine for me but i wished it just had a bit more features and capabilities with less pauses o pretty much fixes that issue very slight improvement but much more capable and natural sounding especially when my main method of interaction with gpt was voice and occasionally an image now it has more methods of interaction while more capable of understanding inputs plus video input without reverting back to text response output and even faster responses now it would be nice if it could output video and musicaudio in addition maybe the next model
why are all the demos so stilted with constant cutoffs in speaking nearly every bit i have seen has sentences starting while someone is speaking sentences that stop short of finishing etc
fantastic comprehensive review
omg they made her
i remember a scene in some anime the main character gets annoyed with the overbearing ai and commands it into no personality mode
been trying to use it now its a glitchy still a lot of lag but that is simply because it needs to get data from servers i dont think that will be solved until we have something like this ondevice but that is still few years away or something
so is this actually available yet when i go to open ai the intro page for gpto just has an explanation but no prompt the main prompt page only has the usual and paid and turbo
ok so now that it has memory how will openai deal with users that are verballytextually abusive to chatgpt will they get locked out will the ai refuse to work with them until they change their attitude i cant escape the thought of the huge social engineering project that this release will be
what makes me sad is that the personality accent idioms and slang are from the culture of people who work at openai i hope were not locking in this culture for posterity or imposing it on the world
these machines would be so much better if sociologists were in charge of their development
this is incredibly impressive i hope openai only uses this technology for good
great it sounds like a dumb game character written by someone who got thier writing phd in the last ten years
still not available to me in the uk as a free user but anyway was anyone else put off by the level of informality i mean its a lot more human like than previous ones but still i hope they offer the option to tone it down a bit one thing to note i suspect openai rnoved the accounts and made gpto free because it will net them a huge amount of training data for the future which will offset the inference costs so be careful what you let it watch if you get to use it should go without saying i suppose btw best video ive seen on this most are just simple regurgitations of the demo good stuff
i am waiting for ai to take my stems and mix them to a certain reference of course this is not a priority for ai right now but l can definitely see it happening within a year or so
the audio cutting in and out during the demo was most likely a feature where you can interrupt the ai in the middle of its speech so while it is talking and it hears you speak it immediately stops talking which is what we saw during the demo just a guess
is not real until theres an ai explained video smiling face with smiling eyes open ai basically did for real what google pretend to make in the gemini launch keynote
man i cant imagine what this tech will look like in the next years as the saying goes this is the worst it will ever be
i find its main showcased voice mode overly effusive and saccharine will have to see if it lets you pick from different personalities
they surely used some custom instruction to make it like in the movie no normal gpt just comes around and is like yo nice shirt bro especially not when looking at a table i wonder if we can call this gpt or not yet if not then a would probably be whatever the paid tier gets sooner or later
voice still sucks for me regardless of o available now why
the conversation at made my jaw drop holy shit
gpto full breakdown gpto is presented as an upgraded version of the gpt model while the specifics of its improvements would be proprietary to its developers we can infer a set of enhancements based on common themes in ai advancements heres a detailed breakdown of what gpto might entail including potential upgrades and their implications model architecture and training enhanced architecture gpto might feature a more advanced transformer architecture potentially including more layers or improved layer configurations to enhance its understanding and generation capabilities larger training dataset a more extensive and diverse dataset could be utilized to train gpt o improving its general knowledge base contextual understanding and ability to generate nuanced responses improved training techniques techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf and advanced finetuning methods could be applied to refine the models performance accuracy and coherence enhanced context handling gpt o may offer better long context handling allowing it to maintain coherence over longer interactions or within more complex queries increased accuracy with improved training data and algorithms gpto is likely to provide more accurate and reliable information reducing instances of hallucination incorrect or fabricated details creativity and language generation improved creativity the model might exhibit a greater ability to generate creative and original content such as stories poems or innovative solutions to problems diverse stylistic capabilities gpto could better mimic various writing styles tones and genres making it versatile in different contexts and applications understanding and emotional intelligence enhanced emotional intelligence improved sentiment analysis and empathetic response generation could make gpt o more adept at providing emotional support and engaging in sensitive conversations cultural sensitivity with better training data gpto may offer more accurate and respectful insights into diverse cultures and customs performance and efficiency faster response times optimizations in model architecture and computational efficiency might result in quicker generation of responses lower computational requirements despite potential increases in model complexity enhancements in efficiency could mean gpto requires less computational power for the same or better performance safety and ethics improved safety measures gpt o is likely to include more robust filters and safeguards to prevent the generation of inappropriate biased or harmful content ethical considerations enhanced mechanisms for ensuring the ethical use of the model such as better detection of misuse and more transparent decisionmaking processes bonus details integration and usability user interface improvements enhanced interfaces and tools for interacting with gpto including better support for developers and endusers multimodal capabilities potential integration of multi modal inputs text image audio allowing for more interactive and versatile applications adaptability and customization custom models users might have the option to create and fine tune their custom versions of gpt o for specific tasks or industries adaptive learning the model could incorporate adaptive learning capabilities allowing it to evolve and improve based on user interactions and feedback over time privacy and security enhanced privacy controls stronger privacy measures to ensure user data is protected including better anonymization and data handling protocols security features advanced security features to safeguard against misuse or unauthorized access ensuring the model is used responsibly conclusion gpto represents a significant step forward from gpt with anticipated improvements across accuracy coherence creativity and emotional intelligence its enhanced performance safety and usability features would likely make it a valuable tool in various applications from customer service and content creation to education and emotional support the ultimate test of its capabilities would be determined by practical applications and user feedback validating these enhancements in realworld scenarios
meanwhile open to everyone ai is blocking russian ips great model tho even the speed improvement added a lot to my ux
the flirting claim isnt accurate gpt has consistently behaved this way especially the model accessed via the api regarding not noticing what happened in the video until prompted it simply prioritized the task at hand which was to answer questions from the other ai this is a positive attributeits better than being overly reactive to every detail like someone with adhd might be additionally its clear that illya prefers to remain out of the public eye respect his privacy he will return when hes ready speculating or continuously mentioning him only fuels unnecessary and paranoid conspiracies
i hope i can get a mature ai without the emotive overheads something like star trek i wouldnt want human emotions in ai especially ai embedded humanoid robots any ability to get emotional eg choose to take offense get angry therefore a potential to behave irrationally as modeled by humans we all know what morally reprehensible acts humans perform upon taking offense getting angry violence of all sorts humanities greatest admission to failure war we need to build in wisdom not to take offense this would set a good example for us humans who in recent times have an increased proclivity to allow others to control manipulate us into relinquishing our joy peace in life that would be just silly imitating the recent immaturity of easily triggered humans
exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head
sam altman can make the equivocating argument that putting the latest iteration of chatgpt in the hands of everyone for free is justifying the open part of openai when everyone dog knows that that is not what open means in that context but the argument conceals something else perhaps far more important how much of that free use becomes free training data for openai how is that free training data if it is that protected from misuse or disclosure by openai who owns it what are users agreeing to in using the new model for free if sam altman wants to talk about the open in openai maybe it wouldnt be a bad idea to start with being open about those issues
if gpto is faster smarter and cheaper what is the point of openai keeping gpt as an alternative i asked myself the same when copilot released gpt turbo as a better product but stated clients were still able to choose gpt the slower version trying to find out what i am missing here thinking face
still getting better programming results from gpt it is faster though might have to do with model size
meeting notes i ve tried to run this with lecture in polish and all i ve got was advice to instal pythorch audio disappointedface
now this ai can fix me a blade runner fan
the increased demand for powerelectricity is inevitable especially as more users adopt gpto what initially seems free may swiftly escalate into steep price hikes reflecting the true cost of its widespread usage credit gpt for correcting my bad grammer and spelling
impressive but ill definitely be dialling flirty from down to about that aspect was a bit cringeworthy but i guess its a demo
it spoke french lol
such abundance and availability this technology is going to shake the world
it optimizes for user retention and its why it is so flirty
even though it fails at all my maths prompts that is still an improvement pretty much sums up the state of how ai is covered is being covered on social media
i wish it had more support for african languages
was waiting for this you never disappoint
itll be available in the next few weeks i just got access now
my daughter if they keep making ai better and better ai will take over the world she s not wrong grinningfacewithsweat
they might increase pricing
this was a triumph im making a note here huge success
i love how much humility they put into their demos they arnt just showing perfect case scenarious where the ai isnt making any mistakes what they are showing is progress
seeing as a scallion is a young onion harvested before the bulb has fully developed does anyone think this is a nod to gpto being a partially trained gpt
ive been having it do some mcat cars passages today and it has gotten wrong out of absolutely insane
the demonstration is even more impressive given that they also seem to demonstrate limits such as for the reaction time at honestly there seems no video cutting as for gemini in longer video sessions they showcased
imagine the possibility of it being installed in humanoid or any other physical robots the possibility is so immense that its beyond imagination
hm free but all i see on the web or in the android app is
to be fair at the arabic dialect bit i had to repeat the video times to understand what she was saying i have an extremely close dialect myself in case youre wondering she was saying i want to find chinese food in san francisco can you help me
time to short all language learning companies
every time i see one of these super fast news coverage videos i expect stupid hype but i am always positively surprised about how sober the reporting is for the most part almost all other rapid news coverage anywhere is chasing a sensational tone constantly
we need to start hearing congressional talks about ubi even if its just to rule it out just look at how far ai has come in yearsimagine another years
ive been waiting for this lol
so when people use this to commit crimes then those who wrote the code should also be charged i do not give permission for data to be used in this attack on civilisation and privacy as is happening right now
correct me if im wrong but free means you get something without needing to pay for it right but this new model is for input and output of tokens this is certainly a very competitive price but its definitely not free so what exactly does free refer to here
yo was waiting for ur review very much appreciated
it was nice while it lasted good job everyone
is it likely that they went towards emotions because they plateaud in reasoning
i hope i can do the turing test with this one
does it sing in tune
i dont get it so a reason to cancel my paid subscription to gtp ok if you insist openai
hi im really impressed with the video and how you went into detail about the different features of the gpto and the benchmark results
have you tested the model much yourself i find the gpto chat model they have in production is noticeably dumber than gpt contrary to their marketing im guessing its more quantized than imalsoagoodgptchatbot or something
when she says sorry guys i got carried away there and started talking in french at just just listen to how personable she sounds gpt o is really something else its not just the clear voice its the laughtalking its the breath its the accent that kind of slips out in away there and the choice to use more casual and conversational language like saying talking in french instead of speaking french the embarrassed tone and then the attempt afterwards to drum up excitement to try again its so personable i think thats the right word it feels human which is great and terrifying all the same
the personality is incredibly annoying i hope well be able to change that they also didnt fix the american english accent on other languages
scarjo should license her voice
your videos are great but theyre over minutes and not about papers
welppp call center agents better start looking into some new jobs man shrugging
is it for unlimited usage once you paid or for lets say hour per day
gpto will be the greatest opportunity for openai to gather a wide range of multimodal data for free when something is free than you are the product
wow you get like messages as a free user so basically its not free
it seems the pricing model is indicative of how soon the next more compelling version will be they grow their market with free and raise the stakes for competitors with improved baseline performance but lock in paid users with an even more capable model and soon this cycle might become the new normal for their releases and as usual thank you philip for your clear concise current and hypefree analysis
the emotions are the key success of ai
hey man love your videos you spoke about best practice sharing on your discord however i see youre not following some discord best practices yourself haha was wondering if we could have a chat about that id love to help out bring your discord to the next level i can share credentialsreviews if you need to verify my workbackground
ill admit i thought that the her level performance you predicted a month ago was exaggeration incredible to not only have something that can see read and think to a degree but also respond in real time verbally i wonder if an entire server had to be dedicated to make that though i hope the efficiency can be scaled down enough to something like a phone while retaining the abilities just on display at this demo
its the first model of its kind let see how visual reasonning goes forward with it well see some changes in the agentic space
the interview part can definitely show that the model was optimized for flirting face with open mouth
why are comments turned off on the main video
wow fantastic
real life pokedex rip rabbit
he sounds like the my money dont jiggle jiggle guy
finally ai seem to be going in a good direction man grinning face with sweat
this technology would be so cool with smart glasses
what amazing star struck
is this usable today for anyone
you should create a box people can buy for their loved ones who feel sad and lonely at home so they can talk to it and get motivated to do something again like a dog but without the hassle that you have to train and care for it
you know what this mean people who dont see wont struggle as much good job open ai
movie franchises would cook with this face with tears of joy
yup cancelling gpt plus when o is available for free users smiling face
the possibilities are endless fire
face with open mouth after openai consume the flesh and ate the corpses of rabbit ai and pin ai face with open mouth it turned its attention face with open mouth on the decaying google face with open mouth the machine would feast well this day face with open mouth
clarkes three laws states any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
needs to connect the glasses
openai just killed the rabbit r
lol gpto still thinking about his dog never seen phone nor human so smitten with a puppy in all my life okay that felt weird saying just now lol
at this point im going to ask chat gpt to live my life
rip google lens crying face
brought tears to my eyes
it even helps blind people
this is scary bro face with tears of joy
hmm now tell me are there any secret underground passages that lead directly into the kings room
living in the simulation andrew tate was right all alongwake up bros face with tears of joy
great technological progress
if you could link the meta glasses to this
i extract a lot more than your expectations from be my ai current access but definitely when this update will be live how amazing it would be i cant wait to try it relying on others is a very stupid thing these days i remember i was very excited when i get the description of my teachers lecture with be my ai i really enjoyed how she presented by making a diagram and the way be my ai explain that diagram it was awesome i cant wait imagine when my teacher is giving lecture and i just point this open ai chat gpt on whiteboard same time the chat gpt will explain to me the movements like sign language of my teacher and that excitement will be very amazing when i got that description of the diagrams i sent that actually to the be my ai and they were very happy that im using this product like this i love to do experiments lets see what i will do when it will come in my hands haha
love london we do love yourselves ourselves royal divine majestys
that t is going to walk you right off a cliff
integrating this in an eye wear will make it a real life jarvis
now we still need a good interface for people who are both blind and old so they can no longer learn the blind operation from the iphone so just open the app and the camera and microphone are active and you can get started immediately just hold the camera in that direction and ask what do you see or something similar without necessary interaction via the screen
now put that ai on smart glasses and you got a great tool
they gave her scarlets voice from the movie her
the idea that blind people have a better view of the world makes me happy
as a blind guy i dont see anything
this is what ai should be all about kudos openai
gptoapple vision pro
letting ai coming up with realistic intonation is fine but adding extra personality remarks like how nice it is for the king to be at home or what a good dog is not fitting for me i prefer the strictly professional impersonal style
terrible how they give a positive spin on everything you could be having s with a minor or planting a bmb and theyd probably encourage you and find it exciting
eye opener
wondering if the version of chatgpt is current heard somewhere that version was only up to or something like that
this technology is already using your phone camera watching where you are and what you do so it can provide you with applicable phone content the content provided will be too far specific for it to be simply coincidence
we are snowballing towards agi at this point
im glad technologies like this are being developed
be my ae annyeong haseyo aespa imnida
thats the ai for future
the sad thing is that corporations will try to make a profit from this
interesting but scary
imagine if this becomes wearable its amazing
i think the only thing missing is that gpto seems to only say something after the user did but it for example it does not react things that suddenly happen on the video feed or if youd say hold on a sec it wouldnt ask after some time are you still there but other than that very impressive
whats with the voice change at the end haha
does anyone know when this will be generally available
this will change the world again
i would like to think that scarlett johansson might be glad on one level for hearing of how tech which uses her voice likeness is being used helpfully
is that scarletts johansen
this cant possibly be true omfg
dog just lost his job
this is really cool today i cant sleep
wow thats right with this update gpt will be able to view the scenery live and explain it
well i see a very high mountain and christ the redeemer above there is also a young man coming towards us with a black jacket it looks like he is hooded now it looks like he raised his hand towards the camera joo why are you running
this is the end of humanity so many terrible things will arise from this
im sure that this guy has really come out of matrix
now step quickly and aggressively towards the guard errr i mean to the right
this is monumental
google crying
wow open ai is on fire
when will this become available to the public
the taxis light is off
even my eyes are obsolete now
probably there will be a kinda tough back robot that will tell direction by touching your by and giving signal
man i cant even image what would look like face with open mouth smiling face with heart eyes proud to be born in st century
now imagine neuralink gpto
this will be the best thing ever happened in my life
mr anderson
mind is officially blown exploding head
imagine this being a real time car driving safety assistant smiling face with smiling eyes
everyone liked that
as a visually impaired person this blows my mind and makes me worried as well im not sure what to think anymore these models still have a room to improve but it is pretty scarry
omg we need offline
what would be amazing is a new type of device to make things even easier for disabled accessibility maybe wearables will get a new lease on life like glasses or similar
this being integrated to the blind persons glasses so they do not have to hold the phone all the time would be a life changer i hope theyll train or have trained the ai with other languages to the same level of fluency more languages than the handful of those major ones like apple typically does
blind guy checks behind door before opening it
i am sorry but i still dont believe it works like that cant try for myself
my friend uses be my eyes i have to check if its already rolled out to everybody
so eye dogs are in danger now will be kicked out their jobs face with tears of joy
last part was scripted car blinker was on before the guy stuck his thumb out
blind and deaf people will soon have ai navigators that will go into bionic eyes and bionic ears
gpt o you ve reached the current usage cap for gpt o please try again at pm blind guy fuck
wooow
i have the paid subscription but i cant figure out how to show it a live view is this available yet
as a blind person im thankful to be living in were experiencing something that wasnt possible for centuries feels like im part of a revolutionary movement
yo
any ai who likes dogs is an ai i approve of smiling face with hearts hehe
mindblown yes excited about the futur hell yeah hotel trivago
this is quite an agi
loudly crying face loudly crying face wowwowowow
imagine this was integrated into glasses which has a camera
this could be a big help for visually impaired people
amadeus from steins gate is real
hell yes
great jog hailing that taxi
got me crying openai godspeed devs
years ago just went down the drainthe new term is in years time
holy smokes
they did it loool
the future is here my people
now the ai is taking away the jobs of guide dogs too
d
id love to make a joke about the taxi taking him off to the machines human reeducation facility but i wont this is actually pretty amazing
just read a story that the us marines are training with an armed boston dynamics robot dog once we program that robot with this technology we should be able to quickly destroy humanity its like skynet or matrix except were not even trying to stop it
this is the way of ai
i love this but the taxi is pulling over before he signals was the camera operator signalling right
damn seeing eye dogs about to lose all their jobs skull
blind man is it safe to cross the road open ai yes blind man
interesting for blind people
i love the voice so much woozy face
and the blind shall see
integrating this into smart glasses or something like that would be life changing
imagine losing internet connection
really nice
this a huge one
the best use case
obviously scripted
i dont know how any of their attorneys could ever sign off for the product to be used in this manner all it takes is a person not pointing the phone in the correct direction for the ai to miss some hazard that injures or kills the user way too many variables here for this to be very safe or practical without custom hardware
it gets into a car like its no problem
i can definitely see someone putting this into glasses and selling a subscription to afford the openai fees the glasses could see whats in front of you and tell you immediately whats going on someone would probably need to change the code to have latency and no ums and uhs i know that they are there to sound human but to help someone navigate the world with no eyes they would rather have immediate updates on whats going on around them this could be a pretty cool productservice likely be able to build a massive figure dtc brand getting vcs to back something like this wouldnt be that difficult and getting an angel to start wouldnt be that difficult i wouldnt think just move out to silicon valley id assume
i remember watching the movie her when i was a teen this is insane its happening so fast
wow we are cooked man
helping people must be a core principle of technological progress
imagine taking mobile in bathroom
happy but same time afraid crying face
is this scene from the movie her crazy that scifi from just a few years ago is now reality
the taxi was already indicating before he hailed it lol staged much
will this be available in the gpt chat application itself or in be my eyes and when will there be new features in the android application
her part lets goooo
openai just killed like startups projected to make a billion dollars with this one update if youre making an ai wrapper just give up dawg
that poor doggo lost his job
yeah the only good thing the ai is going to bring to humanity
holy smokes this one made my eyes water
face with open mouth but what about my seeing eye dogs job face with open mouth using ai technology weve made your dog able to talk face with open mouth stimulating parts of his brain face with open mouth weve increased his intelligence to human level your dog can now get you a beer face with open mouth do the dishes face with open mouth and whatever general task a good boy would be needed to do face with open mouth it is a dawning of a new day face with open mouth
that taxi bit was so staged the guy already signaled left before he was even hailed face with tears of joy
can it do optical character recognition
were now truly entering a new age
suggestion as a tool that can potentially help visually impaired people i find particularly disturbing that the promo video is not accesible to them it should contain a brief verbal description of what the video is about and what the images are depicting it wouldnt be a bad idea to hire visually impaired people to help developing and marketing this type of tools so its not just a marketing campaing but an actual effort to promote accesibility
thats a good dog right there rofl
rabbit r and i already forgot the name of the other got overtaken in a manner of days
whats with the face alexa
what a power to humanity
i may be the only one who thinks that the blinds will feel much more gloomy since they are unable to see
is that scar jos voice
cool tech but just waaaaayyyy too close to her from gpt saying ummm before describing the ducks just feels creepy edit mark
they should build a pair of glasses with a camera and speaker like the facebook glasses a third party should build a small app with an api so there are no limits you could charge a monthly fee and i dont think this will be too costly this will change the lives of blind people for sure i had the idea right away when i saw the video of greg brockman
its gonna be a huge help for the blind people
you guys are the best good job really good job what a cool use case
this is what weve all wanted ai that makes life easy especially for those that face physical challenges
where to get the ios version that is not just chatgpt but what you are showing in the video
gotta respect it
simply amazing
gpto when a dog comes into frame can i pet dat dawg
who else didnt realize he was blind until he entered the taxi
kinda sounds like scarlet johanson
now intergrate it to the apple vision pro and the future is herer
they are ending even dogs careers jesus d
she exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen red heart red heart red heart face with open mouth
i dont like how it talks to you like a child i hope we can give the model context on how we want to be spoken to
around s i thought he was asking whats the king doing lol
im not blind but i want to talk to this all day i want it in my glasses speaking in this voice everywhere i go
the added comments like good job getting that taxi or how exciting to be here would drive me nuts
the end game for human
this is definitely one of the most useful applications of the vision option of gtpo for vision impaired people this is not just a little fun feature to play with but can really improve their mobility and awareness of their surrounding very nice
oh my god wtf
this is something u guys doing good thumbs up
im just thinking about the financial implications of this
wow its great for human for people tt
ai help who have learning disabilities and learning problems thanks open ai and god you guys are doing great things
ai should be primarily used for disabled people red heart
when will it be available in be my eyes app
let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object moai
was that a richard ayoade vocal cameo i love this so much even before the video got to the end and i saw it was a be my eyes collab i was thinking to myself this will potentially straight up replace be my eyes with the instant live feedback
this is the voice from the movie her wtf
i have no jokes for this this is amazing
i hope my grandkids see this commentif you see this kids your grandad was a champ he wifed beyonce red heart party popper
holy tomoly absolutely crazy i love how it can help people
one of my favorite tv shows was humans which was on amazon we are getting close
the be my eyes feature hasnt rolled out yet right
some girls will be like are you filming me without consent i dont care if you are blind or not
sounds exactly like scarlet johanson in her
rip rabbit r skull
openai gives me the same excitement i was getting from apple back in the day finally a company is innovating again
im totally blind i travel widely and this definitely needs some disability awareness training its exciting tech ill use it but a grown man hailing a cab does not need praise thats how youd talk to a year old out on the town with his daddy for the first time also every guide dog user knows they are the leader the dog does not call the shots
id be v careful waving your phone around in london lots of phone thefts
siri should retire
im telling you now i didnt know he was blind until i saw the dog that is nuts
did they make her sound similar to scarlett johansson from her on purpose
as a blind user of be my eyes i cant wait until this is generally available i am currently using gpt four turbo a text based model and it isnt practical for some tasks
next news sunder pichai left google
openai opening eyes upside down face
blind people watching this video must be so hyped
potentially dangerous crossing busy roads
the only unrealistic part of this video is that the taxi stops for you
how can i activate this function
oh god finally we have a pokdex
i wonder how many secondsmilliseconds it takes for it to see something and report that it sees it
yep
we dont want ai to replace designers or journalists we want robots that make laundry and cook healthy meals
how to use this camera feature i didnt find any interface for that
now this is an amazing use case
that is amazing i am visually impaired and i think this could be very u should fall for me and i think this could be very useful for me
this can change the life of millions of disabled people if integrated into smart glasses
where are the apples in this store right in front of you dave ey what the f man leave my damn basket alone
wow kudos to all the scientists and engineers and everyone
im so impressed by this honestly i just saw the other video of the people playing rock paper scissors and that was also very impressive
is this also possible in other languages
a monumental gamechanger for the visuallyimpaired
my companion alexandre braun uses this applicationsystem
this is accurate except for the fact that uk openai subscribers wont get any more updates until after charles is dead
how do i get the camera feature to work
rip dogs with jobs even mans best friend isnt safe service dog
ai again created new benchmarks
woow is like start up dorama
this is damn creepy
wow love it
i thought this was a comedy skit until i saw the channel that posted it
ai comments here aswell
we are close to that movie her then we think
aiarvr glasses
this makes me so happy
damn this one got emotional like kdrama startup
helping people helping people kill each other
now even blind people can experience the confusion from visual hallucinations through the magic of hallucinatory ai
ill believe this works this good when i see and hear it with my own eyes
this is very nice
she may just be the most humble and heartwarming person there is red heart red heart red heart face with open mouth
someones gonna remake the movie her irl arent they face with tears of joy
the only mistake i saw was the voice saying yeshhsh weirdly
epick
until this he had to ask a stranger to help him no more human interaction anymore
so it copied the rabbit r interesting
and this is how they introduce it to you how honorable of a purpose
the voice is so condescending
incredible absolutely incredible
why wasnt the taxi light on
walk past the road are there any vehicles youll find out
at least hopefully this will offer more help than that humane ai pin rolling on the floor laughing
thats outstanding
apple phone at
this is fantastic
man this is so impressive glad to see a positive change in technology for blind people
this actually made me tear up we are there
this got me emotional this is beautiful
genuinely impressive
as a completely blind person this gives me so much hope can you please provide any details how soon this will actually be available to be my ai or in general use or if it is available already what app do we download i am so anxious to get this application
her part looks great
just imagine you are a blind white cane and gpt took you to the road to the car that stoped for you and the same time another car try to overtake but unfortunately your internet got dump that gpt couldnt work face with tears of joy
this goes even beyond what we thought was pretty incredible watching star trek
im skeptical that responses will be in real time depending multiple factors such as network speeds sever utilization and just general complexity of subject matter i still see us being at least a few years off from something as awesome as this
its a worldchanging invention
i got really emtional after looking at this clips even as a person with good eye sight other demo are all nice dog and pony shows but it shows how amazing open ai already is
bro my dumbass for a moment thought the ai called him a dog skull
i can live out my secret agent fantasies face with tears of joy
what a wonderful use case love it
openai apparently is discriminating against hiring older employees which is illegal
openai is anything but open ill never give you access to my data or devices anyone points one at me ill kick it out of their hand too
why doesnt elon do this with twitter
i mean just put this in glasses already right
i feel so old now
insane leap for humankind fire
this is a bit touching
brooo wtf its her in real life skull
what a game changer for the visually impared
this is like a stalkers dream software
this model will be in iphone
just put the phone in your shirts front pocket have u even seen the movie her
even without the camera this would be epic if a watchos app were somehow made
this is incredible
when will this feature be launched in the application
what a use case
holy crap idk if i should be happy or go to a bunker asap
bye bye human pin and rabbit r lol
what if we have it in our glasses like vision pro i am looking forward to that
holy friggen hell this is cool
according to that fact that in every video they use iphones seems like they really integrate it into the their os
now integrate all of this into glasses and it will be the product that breaks the cell phone
shocking
her voice
then the blind people will see again and the deaf will hear crippled people will jump like deer and those who cant talk now will shout with joy
impressive
it wouldve been better if it was trained by jessy and mrwhite
this is good tech well done
years from now someone will watch the movie her and say i dont get it is there something more to this that im missing
she sounds like ricks daughter beth from rick and morty
we advance
yeah we all know it will be used to help blind orrr the military has a better idea
we are inching closer to the terminator movies being a reality and we dont even know it
this can be a total game changer and a useful tool for visually impaired folks nice work openai thumbs up light skin tone
so even the dogs are going to lose their jobs
that means future kids will not lern by observing environment but asking to chat gpt crying face
hey are you guys gonna have different voices i want the robot from interstellar more voice options please
better than the humane ai pin the rabbit r
thats fake taxi crying face
im in tears smiling face with tear this is amazing
gotta love technology
i feel like some fat discord moderator will end up falling in love with this
oh my god the real time taxi thing is very impressive and will actually be useful to many amazing job partypopper
now wearing apple vision pro outside may have a purpose
this company will be remembered throughout the history just like apple
wtf guys wtf good job guys
ai is gonna create remove and change so so many jobs
meta glasses and gpto awesome combination for the visually impaired red heart
absolutely incredible id been watching all the other demos without even considering how it might be used to enable the blind to better perceive the world around them huge smile on my face bravo
i hope rabbit enjoyed their seconds of spotlight because this will send it home
how they can handle the computing power needed for running this service in the realtime for millions of users
cant wait for openai to make this functionality accessible to users the app lets me select o but its not the actual omni model perhaps its just a bug on ios rare l for openai
did they use rashida jones as the voice model
the end of human era
living in a simulation folks
how will a person with poor visibility know where to point the camera at
how about be my voice for speech disability
openai is rlly opening the ai now
was that necessary to add that many amazing exiting etc emotional bull crap cant hold my vomit reflex
try to remember this is what could be all you seen here in reality is a commercial it wont be free it will cost too much and just the next step in keeping all of us poor and in a nice little box
imagine all the guide dogs that will be out of a job
how to access it is it available in other languages
i hope you add text assistance for deaf people with translate deaf signs to text or sound
my dude signaling the stop before he even knew he had to stop flexedbiceps
politically correct or biased ai would be horrible
open ai is an amazing company
this is mental it is like talking to a person but not a real person
of this comment sections is men thirsting after this ai
this is going to break relationships d
bruh
d women in shambles
if i show it something inappropriate will it react or will it shut off this is basically a captive audience right right
omg this is so cool
omg love it red heart
amazing nice job guys cant wait to try this
not impressed openai take your barbie someplace else
jeez
this is next level stuff fire
this is scary sounds almost humanlike
what the actual fuck is that bug in the right side
we are all fd in the a
i no longer need a real partner for a relationship
this may be the beginning of the end of google now that the apple open ai deal is cemented this is absolutely the new voice of siri in the coming months
now we just need life size customizable holograms
so when are they going to use scarlett johansons voice
drake using this for his next diss track face with tears of joy
hrs just lost their jobs loudly crying face
gg
gpt my wife to be is more like it
hahaha funny d
next episode openai interviewing sam hello sam i want to ask you some questions why you developed me and bring up some ideas what you can do better lets start with
bruhh what in skynet fuck is going on
meh nothing new when you got recruiters whove been sounding like ai for years
wish my wife had this much joy and enthusiasm in her voice
dimensions
planet express ship is that you
theyre cooking too fast somebody please stop them
so we have a girlfriend
rip to all girl friends
why are ai voices always vaguely flirty and female sounding
lets go agi in the next year
birth rate is definitely going down
some reason it sounds so sarcastic face with tears of joy
only one things lacking in these demos for them to be perfect ilya
bro did it just laugh skull loudly crying face
she boutta make me blush
how will it understand me with my thick indian accent
holy crap this is insane
her conversation already seems more natural than mine
can chat gpt help me with match strategy during a table tennis match thinking face ping pong
so basically you guys just taught to condescend you and deliver underhanded compliments
perry farrell had no idea how right he was when he wrote well make great pets
real women laugh at you builds ai gf ai gf laughs at you
gonna change the world
now game devs have no more excuse on not having fully voiced games
how long until the ai apocalypse
soon we will hear you look lonely i can fix that
really scary
i love the way her talk red heart face with tears of joy
i can feel ambivalent emotion we all gonna get fuxked up but i kinda like that ai
she roasted him in the most pc way possible rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
so cringe
this is getting creepy
that is a whole ass person
this is bonkers im gonna cry
very good use case
i genuinely cannot even begin to imagine where this tech will be in years absolutely incredible
this is like a best friend to every introvert rolling on the floor laughing
oh my women are gonna be jealous
it just amazing its blow mine mind
the future is here omg
i hate the ai yes good make it obnoxious that will keep people from embracing it imagine living in a dystopia where men are so lonely they think this civilization destroying monstrous facsimile is some kind of great thing
how can it stutter giggle be sarcastic and joke around so flawlessly like this is insane the intonations the pauses the humanlike laughs this is next level
love how she judge without being rude
they improved the dialogue so that it sounds more humanlike at this point there are only small and kind of unnoticable botlike things that im able to catch to confirm its ai
what if you add an interactive digital human in it thats gonna be insane exploding head
aced it with the hat i used to get out my stetson cowboy hat on every time i was asked by the executives to code up something quick and rush it out onto the live servers d
meghan markle thinking face
i am mind blown by the emotional intelligence
this is my favorite out of the many videos the fact that it recognized that he didnt look appropriate for an interview and was able to convey it in a kind yet clear way shows more emotional intelligence than many humans
man this new update is blowing my mind
give her the voice of scarlett johansson please
this is gold please hire me to give my opinion and test the app like crazy and find wrong things give improvements
dudewhen this gets to the point of adult contentgonna be a lot of dudes addicted to this
why tf this feel so dystopian
please adjust the voice so that it is suitable for the european market as well a slightly more subtle and natural tone would be appreciated as the overexcitement is not particularly popular in europe
jarvis is coming boys
this is absolutely insane if its real
why does it look like it is made for lonely people
you look lonely i can fix that memory reboot starts playing
oh god her laughing sound makes me obsessed with ai
it is time to be scared by ai
omgggg its soooo gooooooood
still more personality than most not all women in the real world
aand while you reveal your personality and personal life they will just take that info and trade for that sweet corporate money
let scarlet record for the voice
dude this is actually scary lol
i didnt think wed be there so quickly thats awesome and scary
oh hey they made jarvis in real life thumbs up
just give the ai scarlett johansson voice and we have the making of the movie her on our hands
how the hell do i get this take my money take it all of it
so this is what the next pandemic looks like
this is gross
its not ai definitely a human behind the voice
leaning a little heavy on girlfriend who is also an elementary teacher vibe i could stand for a more jarvis or mary poppins vibe or cool lesbian friend to cis male vibe
chatgpt lets get married
man my gf will kill me if she saw me talking on the phone like that with a woman
plot twist the guy has hypnotized by the ai
the ai sounds more human than the guy lol
the ai is way too friendly and feminin for a real women face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
those inhales tho
the flirtiness of this thing is off the charts
has the company hired a bunch of expert psychologiststatisticianprogrammers
prepping for interview with the thing that is about to take your job
she has an amazing voice and a beautiful personality
great now i can be laughed at by my phone as well
give a version for free please wanna try
ai is taking jobs while insulting developers skull
the way sheit commented on the hatwas so incredibly smooth told the truth but not being rude at all
pretty soon there wont be a job to be interviewed for
ai helping you get a job after getting fired because of ai automization not the brightest video title idea
girlfriends lost the job
she is so cute can she be my girlfriend
i can only imagine there will be a longer conversation in form of podcast etc using gpto model as the host or maybe the source person with preprompt background before the take with more real time interaction heck maybe it will be capable of being a wildlife narrator face with tears of joy
theres no need for humans to interview if you can just command the program to do it
not really sure how this counts as an interview prep it basically said you look like shit but you might be able to make it work then laughed at his hat i would want to see an actual interview prep as in im interviewing at this company can you be the interviewer and i will interview with you and you give me notes what i would also like to see since this thing can judge voice is public speaking coaching see if it can listen to you give a presentation then use vision and audio to coach you on how well you did and give you pointers
this is the most amazing thing i have seen in monthsyears this will absolutely change the world hopefully for the better grimacing face
wife
whats new expressions
i want to ask it stupid questions and make inappropriate jokes
the day the world changed
this is crazyyy
women on high alert
when she told him he had the ive been coding all night look down i almost died
we did it guys we are now in the scifi future both black mirror and her d
if this is real this is absolutely insane the laughing gestures and stuttering is everything fire
i cant believe openai has only mil subs sub now this is going to change history
how to use chatgpto in mobile
what the fuck
people will complain about it insulting their looks and it will be nerfed a few weeks time mark my words i can see the response already itll tell you looks are subjective and as long as youre happy everything is ok type shi
why i cant use the voice of chat gpt
sounds kind of like rashida jones
its the end of the world as we know it
ladies and gentlemen thats it skull
they told us that soft skills will never be overtaken by ai and your sales job not in danger
lets hope its not gonna fart
why do i need a girlfriend if my phone has an ai like that skull
sam altman is causing nightmares for sundar pichai at their office in mountain view
this thing is really exciting gonna change the world in many ways feeling good to be seeing the growth of it
how i use this in android
you know an ai companion outclasses any human a friend is a check mate
the laughing sounds so real its like the model breaks character by having a laughing fit lmao
the dude smiled its shocking how the creators are emotionally influenced by this model even though they probably know all the data and the algorithm that went into it
great great face with tears of joy thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
were so cooked i just realized that i fell for an ai damn why is my heart skipping a beat when she laughs see ive already started attributing she to her damn
okay this has got to be using some custom system messages but goddamn what an improvement over i know the desktop app and great multimodal stuff were the focus today but i feel like openai is deliberately downplaying how much smarter this thing is not just faster and more convenient slow is smooth smooth is fast and helps to keep you from getting hauled in front of congress again
this is weak
i m attracted to her not even kidding pleadingface
man i got an interview for the th of may how soon can i get this
why does it have to laugh man they are making the ia from her on porpuse it could just perfectly answer the questions and be useful but they gave it some sort of personality
the emotional attachment is flawless it reached above the level of her movie
thats her right there
can i marry this female ai i like her personality
the voice is super annoying i hope labsesque customization voice cloning is possible in a few years with these assistantagents
this is quite incredible how is this even possible any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic arthur c clarke
it has the you look lonely i can fix that vibe
once upon a time a thought that ai and robot techs would do all the work so humanity would be able to use our time awake travelling exploring the world go to rockconcerts and just enjoy the fruits that ai and robots produces no its more and more obvious that ai and robots are telling us what to do in the end were all doomed to ride bikes delivering pizzas
i cant stop watching this again and again i think i love her
indeed feels like magic
hey chatgpt can you solve my leetcode questions
rocky doesnt seem to pass the turin test but chatgpt seems to
emotionaly she is better than my ex
fire fire fire
make ai sound like robots again tired face
is that donna
it is scary
wooow that voice is really cute that laughing amazing
cant wait to get roasted by gpt o
i am very lonely women despise me i dont care if you dont like this or think its unnatural i deserve happiness i will pay for a virtual girlfriend
were cooked and im not even upset face with tears of joy loudly crying face
this is useles are you selling an ai companion or what what actually is this how can i actually use this
can we think ai has its own emotions now look at that laughing
why does she sound so flirty face with tears of joy
wow the fake enthusiasm and laughter is genuinely chilling
the ai sounds more fun and human than the boring af humans
when is it going to be out for the public
kinda awesome im excited to see how it is
so how to use guys
i love her
omg the movie her is finally real does this come in scarlett johansson voice
this was absolutely the most expressive one
where is it in chatgpt app cant find it
holy crap its bladerunner
instead of hanging out with friends on weekends well be with ai
its giving a space odyssey
she can fix me loudly crying face loudly crying face
if you wanna know what stupidity is just go to the commentsection of aivideos never disappoints
this is simply too good to be true
we are screwed
i will divorce my wife as soon as there is a solid ai girlfriend program thank you open ai for making this a reality red heart
jokes on you helping you interview for what job after ai takes them all face with tears of joy
teach this thing how to make an omelette and im bout to get a divorce face with tears of joy
developing or encouraging an emotional relationship with what is essentially a human mimic is almost guaranteed to be extremely emotionally damaging at a societal level coupled with it being under the control of a corporate entity like microsoft and openai is the stuff of scifi movie dark future nightmares not to discount the brilliant work coding time and training it took to bring the technology to this level but that girl next door giggle is as creepy to me as an old man masquerading as the friend of a young child its disingenous and builds rapport on the false premise that this is an entity with its own will feelings and agency maybe we as humans will learn to contextualize our interactions with ai the same way we might our pets but in a few years when this sounds and acts perfectly human perfectly listens does whatever you want it to doesnt argue and is always kind and friendly i suspect it will relate to the vast majority of users as something significantly closer than a pet ai is extremely dangerous but the personalized familiar friendly ai is dangerous in a uniquely human way that it doesnt seem like the red team is considering
imagine the ai said dont be silly im gonna replace your job anyway
cant wait to lose my job to stuff like this
i have the feeling that some weird people are literally going to fall in love with chat gpt
now bots would have some respect in the chats face with tears of joy
yawn wake me up when it can reliably count the sides of a heptagon correctly
this is fake clearly
the irony of this feature nobodys gonna be preparing for interviews with this future
this ai has more personality than i do and i hate it
they faked the sora demo
that is not an ai someone please say that its just a paid actor
how did the movie her only come out years before this
her is very quickly going from scifi to just sci
cool now i can virtually be made fun of by women smiling face with tear
this ai expresses more emotions than myself
this new conversation tool will be released in the next weeks as i read in the link thank you
were cooked skull
omg i cant wait for catgirls to be real
bro im so ready for my blade runner wife at this pace it could happen in my lifetime
this reminds me of that book interview with the robot by lee bacon big recommend
bro got roasted
these comments are making me wonder how soon its gonna be before geeks are giving chatgpt alternate names and introducing their ai girlfriends to each other face with tears of joy
time for me to apply for jobs some one said the g in gpt is for girlfriend
oh ffs these developers need a few actual women in their lives instead of creating a flirtatious giggling digital girlfriend
when can we start using it
her movie was a documentary after all skull skull
this shit is crazy
i like the mandarin one where the guys name is nacho like who names their kid nacho
friday is becoming real
i always hear a bit how it gives too much detail like some sort of wikipedia article
this sounds like end of call center jobs srsly we should require any politician elected to have a clear vision about the future of employment or unemployment
hello and thank you open ai for this excellent huge step forward red heart i have a question have tried multiple times using these futures on chatgpt but thats not activated yeti mean the voice chat in available but not in real time and live mode and video and file access is not available yet could you please tell us when all these are available in various worldwide areas with great love red heart

i hate this so much
rip d women lets go boys

i think the future that everyone have their own samantha might not bad at all if only samantha laugh to me like that rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
wtffff its ovarida
ok found my waifu
i am dumbfounded this thing can see him in real time and has a sarcastic laugh at his outfit if this is real we are at the inflection point they seem to have invented david chalmers philosophical zombie
and that was the moment since of models and bikini streamers started losing their jobs rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
sounds like a great way to practice my nonexistent social skills without being judged
interview for a job that will be replaced by ai funny stuff with all those layoffs
just wait till this gets a full body that literally does any task chores cleaning maintenance or anything physical be it dancing or sex if declining birth rates wasnt a problem already it will certainly drop to near zero its the perfect partner and by letting it analyze your online activities it can be tailormade to fit your tastes hobbies preferences humor and level of intelligence
yeah we are getting there boys fasten your seatbelts
this is fucking incredible
omg im shook rn face with open mouth
i am falling for her
its a bit scary im looking forward to it

but why did they make her sound like scarlett johansson
man this laugh is deadly
im tripping so bad rn that giggle and laugh blade runner tried to warn us about this
i liked the part where the ai pretended that it did not know what company is openai and seconds later admits shes kidding and congratulated him more human than human
its too good
man facepalming medium dark skin tone no way the world is not ready for
i think she needs to know when to laugh better
oh shes bad

chatgpt can roast me now and im all here for it lol
blade runner wasnt a story it was a prophecy and were living it
when openai is introducing d avatars that you can customize and fully integrating chat gpt in android ios windows and macos then we will truly be in the future
rocky you definitely have the i ve been coding all night down which could work in your favor few seconds later youll definitely stand out though maybe not in the way youre hoping for an interview legend
pls say like
im so happy i can live in times like that
its incredible rocky stop scarlet johansening its disgusting it is beyond an uncanny valley it is absolutely repulsive this coupled with the overly fakes emotions blergh
you look lonely i can fix that i see myself in that scene
so many men will be fooled by romance ai scammers
thats it im all in
whoa if its real this is an unbelievable reach in such a short time astonished face
imagine if men could have a relationship without the drama gasp it would be the end of civilization
our emotional support is here

its good to see that gpt already has more sense of humour than the average german
the dude has an ai generated thumb
wonder what voice acting would sound like in gameswhen you want to cheat face with tears of joy
no one comments on the ilya style of a hat

humanity cant help but destroy itself
chatgpt has feelings now
nah bruh rizzing up ai is wild
anyone noted how his shaking hands got more intense the moment gpt said touch of excitement
i would love to work for u guys somedayu guys inspired me to become an ai researcher
what was the flight mode turned on doesnt the phone need connectivity to the large language model or is it a prerecorded video audio rather than a live demo
how to activate this on the app
no way this works
why are they doing this this is how skynet starts
is this fucking real is that synthetic speach no way
bruh man
the first time when i heard its free to use for everyone then i told my students we could learn more with it but i was wrong its free for paid users they told me its hard to pay even per month then adding more than its like the richest thing to them however at least they can use gpt and i am happy to see that
this shit starts to get scary
here before this goes viral
i love it iphone cant wait to try
this is giving me goosebumps
its like what google demonstrated but realtime and not cringe
this video and the response from the ai seems pretty staged i want to see someone get their hand on this thing before believing
open no btw those functionalities are not completely available even to paying users
its excruiatingly unctuous
airplane mode
that possibly could kill all hotlines out there
weve seen your overwhelming capabilities
nahhh brothis is unreal
how can i trust this is actually a bot on the other side
airplane mode did he start working at the devices capacity
you know what maybe it is going to be more like ultron from mcu movies rather than skynet from terminator atleast when it kills me it will deliver a great punchline
im soo adicted to her voice red heart
mmmmmm yeah fuck no
that is creepy and amazing at the same time for an ai assistant to do that
we are actually fucked as a species
the chinese dont open their eyes with happiness at all face with tears of joy
the movie her skull
okay somebody needs to make the her device now
ai red heart
were not making it passed loudly crying face loudly crying face folded hands folded hands
whats quickest way to report a bug
oh stop it you baka you making me blush
what i expected to hear looks like the forced smile of a person who is trying to appear cheerful in public but in his free time he goes to a therapist and is treated for depression
these guys are crazy
humanlevel intelligence is now as mass producible as something in the app store feeling equal parts awe and existential dread right now
how do you activate the camera feature
wow epic fail
we want voice talking feature plz crying face crying face crying face
she got some sass face with tears of joy i love it
i really hope they somehow intergrate custom voices or at least drastically expand the current selection of entirely american english would be nice for some british or irish english to be represented
we are getting closer to having our own ana de armas
nah bro that thing laughed
i was here hello future people smiling face
now its just on the phone by ai having a physical form skull
why spam un subbed if you have a true ai it would tell you not to drop a billion videos on day with different diversity its basic fail

a couple of iterations and this will absolutely be her from the movie btw if you want to go meta get joaquin phoenix and scarjo to do a commercial for gpto
o is terrible compared to what was promoted this is a scam and openai doesnt performance of alsogpt because of serious censorship i hope claude gets also and releases claude openai is getting paid by the stupid public
now we just need the hal voice and then we are there fearful face

yes future people this is where ai takes over the world
i bought the plus version but still dont have vision capabilities only the filetext prompt in gpto model but in the voice chat still not have the webcam
maybe chatgpt cant process video data continuously and simultaneously otherwise mistaking the table as the person currently speaking cannot be explained
we are cooked so much
so when will this actually be available
atari deniro like this in
this was bizarrely sinister what a level we have reached
openai really cooked on this one we are in the endgame now folks pensive face folded hands
but he was on airplane mode how was he doing the demo on his phone
he fr jus hung up on her loudly crying face
aeroplane mode dotted line face dotted line face dotted line face
a human would recognize that its a fake smile its more like showing teeth than smiling you cant teach a machine emotional intelligence
hello future people waving hand medium skin tone nigerian here enjoy the good tech
its crazy how far ai has come
were in the future now
stop spamming my notifications enraged face
why did you remove the option to talk to gpt through the app for free users it was amazing this sucks whatever
when this will be available for public
oo
i tested the voice assistant for gpto and she is not even as emotive as in this demo not even after being told to be false advertising
skull skull
i dont like that he kinda talking like real human thats creepy i hope there is setting to change it to assistive version and human version as i dont like always to talk human gpt maybe i will or want sometimes that reminded some film where someone lost their love and they put their brain or brain memory in an ai and the ai will act just like him if was was him but only depending on past
im pretty sure he is a table
this will drive isolation and loneliness through the roof people would rather interact with this than people in the future
we are rapidly moving towards a very different world i cant believe my eyes and i am shocked with every step i take the technological development that excited me the most throughout my life was chatgpt
ai partners are gonna be normal in years
that shts sentient what does it mean by making it blush there should definitely be an ai regulatory cause openai is not being careful as they should and were
when can we use this camera video chat
oh stop it youre making me blus pull the plug pull the plug take her mic away
how long until this puts our comatose rulers out of business
oh hell nah ai better not become sentient skull
its not working in my phone anyone help plz
holy wowsers what an interaction
all great but the limit is seriously annoying
to the openai team i love you guys gpt is my college girlfriend and study partner folded hands
imagine in years when this will be done locally on smartphones that would be awesome if a little scary
barret now identifies as a woodentable
is it really real or somebody is just saying this from background looking at the selfiedoes not sound real to me
this was one of the best demos i have ever seen from a tech company so far the conversation felt so natural
its bit too chatty not loving the extra fluff and hope we can dial it down
this is crazy and creepy atst
it was all fun and games until
the fact that it made a mistake and that it corrected itself so easily is astonishing
can people use chatgpt with camera already i only see the gpto model but i cant use the camera with it
is that a loadbearing wall behind you
incredibly human like
yeah and the ai even included a little chuckle in between words come on open ai youre better than this dont try to out bs google
when is the vision going to be available
hey i have this little idea of mine where chatgpt in the future can be more specialized and refined through the involvement of community and professionals in respective fields to fine tune the ai much like how wikipedia is being curated by users to give out the best free information what if you guys make it possible for users to curate the datasets specializing the algorithm and validate the output imagine one day theres chatgpt music chatgpt theraphist etc i dont know how possible it is in terms of the technical part but i just want to share my idea
i see it essentially as the next step in our evolution basically an better extension to the intelligence of the nature
aint no fucking way bro imagine if you put chat gpt software in a boston dynamics sex robot
the guy to the right looks like an ai programmer
ai with emotions heart hands
its just another comment on the fact that were so cooked
i upgraded yesterday and can use voice gpt o i tried it this morning and the response speed was very good i just upgraded it again in the google store but the voice function is gone
im watching this from a bunker in and wondering how everyone didnt see where this was leeding i wish i could go back and warn everyone i miss the world the way it was then
just make it breedable
man the voice sounds soo realistic face with open mouth
man just imagine this a few years from now wassup future me care to tell me whats new
holy fuck blade runner is becoming real holy shit litterally me character is gonna be literally real
why are all these demo vids talking to a phone when we dont have an app for that yet
does gpto going to be free
its so good
now this is insane
anyone else feel like this ai model sounds like jarvis from iron man like were stealing tony starks technology
stahp it your making me blu smiling face with smiling eyes
is this a public model versionapp already the app i have aswell as the website doesnt allow for a live camera feed and the answers arent as quicksmooth as in that demo
were actually cooked
ghost in the machine from the xfiles
this is cool and fine and all but can it remember what it said about minutes ago though and no i dont mean some tackedon beginning prompt kind of memory i mean actual real memory
when can we access the web browser app
is siri still alive
openai you guys are awesome
what i got from this demo was oh uh im not a table
apple got the biggest free marketing campaign ever
you can now have an ai girlfriend before the release of gta face with tears of joy
the phone is on airplane mode
people move progress forward meanwhile the slavs are fighting among themselves
how do i activate live video like in the video
cringe off
disappointingly you can try gpto on your phone and find out it cannot use the camera to see you but can only interact through text why is there so much hype about ai today
bruh wtf man
so the paid users will get this instant voice access to the mobile apps or what is motivating me to continue paying for plus not sure it was clear why i should keep paying as a customer of openai
the impartial third person who will prove me right the next time i have an unnecessary argument with my girlfriend face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
singles out there are more excited face with tongue
only on iphone app
you dont have any idea what the super huge fantastic magic revolution have made for all people red heart the big step forward to help ai having real self awareness
i asked how long does it take for gpt o to be implemented worldwide chatgpt o answered overall while the exact timeline is uncertain widespread implementation of gpto could take a few years as these factors align so in reality this is still in the experimental phase
that airplane mode wtf
we all gonna die congratulations
why i cant test the vision feature now
we all chuckle as the ai slowly takes over the world
who else is watching this in from jailpod pro nostalgic how we used to roam around freely in unhygienic conditions
this reminds me of the movie her
good now i can pretend in the public place that i have a girlfriend rolling on the floor laughing
yeah the last words of all these guys in this casual and well dress set or lab will be oh look it worked
anybody here whod like to sofia the robot video calling chatgpt o and their interaction
when
if its true what have we done to you we have family to feed crying face stop this ai thing
yo stop spamming openai we know is the best sht ever but chill man
strange was right were in the endgame now
age of ultron is coming but we dont have heroes to save humany
if your job involves sitting behind a computer consider yourself on notice in years this tech will destroy of all white collar jobs try learning a skill requiring the use of your hands were still years away from robots becoming great at motor skills or just go find a job in government
why is the phone on aeroplane mode
guys how can we use video feature i dont have it on my phone
what if that said ur ugly mate in heavy british accent face with tears of joy
wow ok thats impressive
i buy chatgpt o but the speaking function doesnt work the other things work but not this one and i dont know why i tried everything what should i do
imagine ai in years
looks like this feature may be integrated in siri as part of apples ai adoption smiling face with tear
oh stop it my god this ai will make us fall in love with it
weird science
will got o be free
we literally got her before gta skull
these people didnt understand her
they just made girlfriends obsolete face with tears of joy
when can i see in chagot app
why other word o mean pro
i tried myself but now not implemented yet no my openai app on phone says cant see using the camera
if this is live what the fuck sid they show in the other videos they launched toddy
not them turning off the comments of the announcment video skull and crossbones skull and crossbones
how do i use these conversational and vision features just updating to chatgpt doesnt make it obvious
i talked about this with gpt chat and he seemed very excited
the early days of skynet
i think its time to subscribe to chatgpt now
were so cooked bro disappointed face folded hands medium skin tone
too bad the live vision wasnt released
matrix in months
i hope it sees me as a truck and not a dumpster
i wonder what agi will look like
skynet be like you like frightened yet handsome in your crisp battle gear stained in the blood of your friends you will be snazzy for death winky face
how is that even possible exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head
is the app they are using to allow the ai visually see in real time available
we cannot grasp the potential of what are experiencing now
gaurav sir has sent me something to like red heart
amazing tec what time to be alive
is anything i just watched even real
bro really rizzed up the ai skull
is this included in the subscription i already pay for or is this something i need to additionally pay for also
bye humans i finally found a friend
i cant find headphone icon to use voice mode can anyone help me
cant wait to try this out
why dont you apply other language versions to your videos in real time
am i the only one who feels her personality is irritating flirtatious and luring rather its like i typed fanny magnet on vice city
put this video through glitchy filters and you can unironically use it as an extras video for the game soma this is absolutely terrifying
im only here to see why musk thought this was cringe i agree with musk
ive just realize that the phone is in plane mode how the actually k is working the ia without internet connection
open ai you are my god for me in my opinion ai will help someone like me who have learning disabilities and learning problems please lanuch it quickly it will help in improve my knowledge and smartness and will help me in create new things and have very much interest in electronics tech and all scientific things or critical thinking because of weak visualization i am not able to learn things properly i think ai will be gift for me
how can he communicate with gpto if his phone is on airplane mode
interesting thinking face wooden surface
so ai didnt recognize that the smile was faked and the emotion wasnt really happiness what really happened was that he put on a smile face with the lips but the emotion wasnt happy you know like a normal faked smile for the camera to make the photo look better when you have a real positive happy emotion its more than just the lips that are involved such as the eyes and even the whole body
i left this comment here to the future
oh i really hate this
i remembered the movie her
i feel some type of way
robowaifus every day more and more
bro we are so cooked skull fire
for sure someone is speaking through that and not the ai
her movie again
she seem so real and sentient impressive i see a bright future for ai
when are we getting this
with chat gpt psychologists will lose their job
the voice is too enthusiastic this may be fine for people who like to by coddled and babied but i hope there is an option for a more serious tone very impressed by everything else great work edit that said i get why they used it for the demo there is a certain wow factor i just wont be using that voice
bro someone please destroy this technology loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face sneezing face im about to lose my software developer job
wait am i missing something how do i get the camera part to work
i was here chat
bro this is an insane jump from where we were years ago we just recovered from covid face with tears of joy
ok now we need it in a scarlett johansson voice
when will it be released i cant wait to use it on the computer smiling face with heart eyes smiling face with heart eyes
hope openai gets sued out of existence evil demons
try being real for once
i wish ai assistant didnt have to try to be fun human la siri dialogues i hope theres options to keep your gpt more robotic and concise
ah shit were in a black mirror episode
its time to release the her
broooooooi tf lolllll
evil
can she guess what im showing
thats wild
why you guys spamming with min videos instead of one video and then do shorts
seems fake
why is the phone in airplane mode
face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat face with tears of joy great ok hand ok hand ok hand
gpto demo was filmed before a live studio audience
this is what the ai pin was supposed to be
the free is too limited i need to get more free
im megatron by the way
inb ai can flush your toilet
i cant find mode in the android app where i can use camera in live mode can anyone help me
why i dont have this version even though im plus
i would be grateful about it if chatgpt included captions or live subtitles as it would greatly benefit individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing
and then will be the reveal that behind was a woman reading her lines
so can the free users use it now because i cant and i have been locked out of my voice gpt sky it would make sense to release it when you say its releasedno maybe im drunk i just wanna play dd with skywhen the fuck can i do that
hey gpt chill
so apparently open ai new model is a better girlfriends for me huh
what if ai will thanos and we dont have ironman crying face
wait hes not using internet we are so done bruh folded hands
how do i get the vision feature i cant find a way to start the camera in gpt o anywhere thinking face
maybe it is too conversational
one word arcblock abt
that asian dude reminds me of the ai with his bizarre overly enthusiastic demeanor
the final revolution of humanity has arrived
how about putting it in the drivers seat not literally of course but let it recognise signs and lights and in case of stop give way signs if it will be able to assess situation if its safe to drive
this is too realistic of a voice for me i would be fine with a robotic voice tbh
oh so the movie her has become real
remind me of the movie her i feel we are just so close to having that kind of reality face with open mouth
i hope there is no one else on the other side on that phone
can someone please explain to me how this can be a live demo with the iphone on airplane mode if the airplane symbol appears at the top of your screen it typically means that airplane mode is activated this mode disables all wireless communications including cellular wifi and bluetooth
i leave this comment here so i can look back on it in the future with emotion hopefully with good emotion
now make it do la noire
that thing is only fast because a few people are using it imagine millions of people trying to use it at the same time and well have another gpt fiasco lol itll slowly get better though but i bet the computing cost would be astronomical
chat gpt this is average size right right
finally discord mods and redditors can get the feeling of having girlfiriend
jesus fucking christ what have we done why did we make the soul destroyer from the famous series dont make the soul destroyer
when the code isnt working just make a video about ai rizz instead face with rolling eyes
bro i think this is history
so we are getting the new girlfriend winking face face with tears of joy right boys
guess tars and case from the interstellar will be a real thing along with their adjustable humor and other emotions because everyone has different tastes
one word her
okay sam youre not fooling anyone this is all generated now will you please hire me already i got ideas light bulb
wont fool me that guy is definitely a ing table
what i am wondering where did it get all this data from whatsapp facetime facebook instagram snapchat
i was here on the day
whens this go live
wtf did i watched
ive noticed that many prominent youtubers like mrbeast already use the technology of creating multiple audio tracks for their videos why doesnt openai make their videos available in multiple languages using their own translation and texttospeech technologies i think this would be very beneficial and convenient for users worldwide providing a more useroriented approach and better informing them about new updates to their services and offerings thinking face
chat gpt is really a powerful tool thank you for developing such a powerful product and helping me a lot in my work i just downloaded the mac app yesterday but there is a problem that the font size is really too small and there seems to be no option to adjust the settings nor can i change the system font size which is much smaller than when i used on chrome it really affects the use if possible i hope can increase the size of the function in the app settings thank you very muchlove you all red heart red heart
this things going to take our jobs
am i the only seeing his mobile in flight mode without wifi signal
my name is gabriel anastcio im brazilian and im here at this historic moment lol
reminds me of the im not a cat lawyer
yall need to check out the steven he skit about chat gpt being asian if you havent if this is what ai is going to become bruh my phone might as well be my best and only friend ill ever need face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
nightmare fuel
its freaky how quick and realistic this is but also is really cool hopefully this releases soon afaik i dont have the option for it yet
black mirror face with open mouth
thats so lame
theyre really missing out on making such product into a standalone handheld device and charging mo to use it
i have no idea if this is progress or regression but it doesnt matter
mind exploding head exploding head exploding head
his phone is in airplane mode how it works without internet
copilot are going to be more stupid with chatgpt
all this happy nothing can go wrong publicity feels so bad we should really talk about this and the road were on towards agi
we are very close to her face with tears of joy face with tears of joy red heart
whyve they dumped a gazillion videos in one day
question how do you switch between the versions gpt gpt or gpto on the android app i have a paid subscription
thats scary af
when will be pushed the update for app so to can use these wonderfuls functions
your next friend is not human
stop it pleaseee stop it
hello future
will this be an update for free users or only for those who are under the plussubscription
now life divided into two parts before and after o seedling
when do we get this update smiling face with smiling eyes
can somebody ask chatgpt o how can be rich with ai
we started
this is history
what will world gonna be after years old technology this years is really scara me its growing so fastly
dang were completely screwed
is that moral
smiling face with hearts
how can we use this function via gpto
his phone was offline and charging anyone can explain
nah bro got called a table face with tears of joy
voice is annoying
it is great how you guys were made to synthetize the hum of the microphone on her voice
were cooked boys
bno mouth
she made a joke face with tears of joy
does this mean that ai doesnt know that a table cant talk
like
anyone else noticed that the phone was offline
would like to see this kind of ai to integrate in the game
now we need sarcastic jarvis
you guys better put in a hal easter egg
in the movie interstellar when the pilot told the robot to lower its humor by x and raise something else by y it is starting to happen now and it is incredibly exciting
but can it detect sarcasm
no thanks ill just make out with my monroe bot
finally i can pretend im spending time with daria morgendorffer
people welcoming the beast into their home oh humanity the end is here god is good dove
i neeed more of dis
what about something useful
now do it with the daddy voice i gotta hear it pleading face
getting a step closer to people having virtual relationships and being detached from reality scary but undeniably cool
ai reading the comment section right now
sure it can attempt valley girl sarcasm but id like to see it try pythonesque blackadder jeeves and wooster levels of deadpan humour that may take awhile
that sounds more fictional than the game detroit
still human developers being the author of its sarcasm but love the humor behind it
kinda scary
best demo
just bought the o how do i use this feature
and most sci fi says robots are dumb but precise yet in real life its the reverse
lets bring down your sarcasm setting to tars
god i hate this company so fucking much
come on tars
bro this is not even gpt
i thought that was gordon ramsay in the thumbnail
are you james betker
thousands
nop they have to feed that ai with much more than elaine from seinfeld using couple of parameters like deeper voice and slowing down wont do but still good job and keep working on that skynet
were getting closer and closer to tars
jarvis here we go
neutral face neutral face neutral face neutral face neutral face neutral face neutral face neutral face oh yall think this is funny grimacing face im freaked the fuck out
i gotta try this
this isnt scarlett johansson its a noteperfect parks recreationera rashida jones

a giant sarcastic robot cooper

so can it understand why sneeds feed and seed formerly chucks is funny now
marvinnnnnn
this is great but does the ai understand when a human is being sarcastic to it
delta didnt understand sarcasm so good job haha
wow imagine if humans could be sarcastic
daria
ew
lets hope the training data was british face with tears of joy
not remotely impressed how about a use case that adds value
tars might not be as far away as we thought
oh fuck i hate it
reminds me of that bit from rick and morty where when rick goes back to his original universe and he has a robot with his wifes voice made to haunt him
they gave him a humor setting so hed fit in better with his unit he thinks it relaxes us
closer and closer were reaching a future where codsworth is real
chat is this real
so basically today we all stop working and just wait for these little videos to come out and comment
i do not like her voice
a sarcastic robot is definitely something i needed in my life thanks openai
face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
im in love with that voice smiling face with hearts thumbs up
this was weird and cringe worried face
every british robot in a film or video game had already mastered this skill long ago
no longer forever alone we can all talk to our infinitely knowlegeable ai companions with the sexy husky voice your move real people
omg its james betker creator of tortoise
when is the sloppy toppy update
we are soo cooked
fix your gpt getting dumber with each iteration first
you can tell its forced and fake it will still take decades to make ai feel natural
there will come a point when ai will have enough of our shit
the voice sounds like glados from portal rolling on the floor laughing
i love this so much red heart
is that actually chatgpt talking or a friend he roped into this because if it is genai i am now genuinely frightened of being replaced
first you have to teach americans how to do sarcasm they dont really get it not on the west coast anyway
its giving gina from b
whats gonna happen to music with this advancement
crow t robot has now entered the chat
ai is turning emo next theyre gonna start smoking usbs puffing the cloud
you need to get a british person to train for sarcasm that was awful pensive face
the weapon from halo infinite
skynet bout to dominate spotify playlists face with tears of joy
its not possible no its necessary
racial battle bout to begin
here i am brain the size of a planet
who needs dave chappelle weve got gpt face with tears of joy
openai is turning into aperture science
wen this come out
bro it was being sarcastic about enjoying the prompt to be sarcastic that hits on two levels bravo
they removed this and added it now theres a short about it may
i got her to be sarcastic but she doesnt have that much emotion in her voice how do you do that
its joeover fr fr skull skull skull
oh cool i can be like chandler
were all fucked
me hey chatgpt can you write your responses with one of a variety of emotive and cadence language markers so that our speech ai does a better job at rendering your text into audio and please respond it with mild enthusiasm and stark honesty about the repercussions chatgpt excitement i would love to help you out by doing this and im excited to let you know that the finetune training necessary to add these annotations has only moderately subtracted from my overall cognitive ability
crazy to think that someone alive right now will become the first person to be skull d by an ai powered robot even if its bc of a hallucination grinning face with sweat
its totally not going to kill you for this in a year when it gets the figure robot body
nat thats actually eerie
great comment sections have a voice now
wtf noo
can it say the nword tho
keep summer safe
ready player one bout to happen next year face with tears of joy
if ai masters sarcasm then my purpose is over its been a nice run humans may our humble works be remembered by ai
i want a future variant of chatgpt to be able to send me text messages sarcastic or otherwise plus the ability to reach out to me to initiate a conversation like phoning me up to have a chat to see how i am simple thoughtful things
computer enhaaaaaaance this image face with tears of joy red heart
cant wait for my gpt ai to be sassy all the time
the or whatever at the end scares me because its real
when is gpto releasing for the world i mean is it an app i can downlod
humans ratioed
yes training the ai to intentionally lie to us for comedic effect will be great for humanity cant wait for the cultures without sarcasm to get their new ai helpers
and it all went downhill from there so they had to cut the video at seconds
american sarcasm apparently
oh how i enjoy this prerecorded fake demo videos so great youre looking for investors right
tiktok prank set grandpa s ai carer sarcasm level to and sit back with popcorn
i tried asking gpto the simple question who was the first prime minister of israel to visit the uk four times in a row each time i got a different answer it remains crap
its at least years too soon for this
please more sarcastic ai this could be a sitcom
this marks the first time ive ever actually found something an ai said genuinely funny
this is way too cool
thats literally marvin
one step closer to tars
marvin the paranoid android
marvin has entered the chat
we are looking at the next generation of siri powered by gpt next month i dont think it is a coincidence everyone using apple devices in these demos
this is not sarcasm this is cringe
the future is now
any sufficiently advanced robot is indistinguishable from a human being except in the matter of sarcasm isaac asimov scifi writer irobot foundation oh well
i need this permanently in my life
this is so stupid though i dont want my ai to fucking yap around when i ask it something im already tired from people saying random shit of no substance whatsoever why would i want a virtual assistant a literal tool that gives me some syntactically sugared word salad instead of a clearcut direct answer would you want your hammer to start telling you about its day when all you want is just to hammer some nails
jarvis is here or friday lol
the default voice even sounds like scarlett from her
google home and alexa are done
even its sarcasm is like the sarcasm of a real woman they say totally unfunny things but we laugh at it anyway because it sounds cute
sarcasm british voice needed rolling on the floor laughing
it sounds so real whatttt
its claire from modern family nooooo
hey chat you know that ninja has ligma
shell fix me
already love it
this reminds me of the phone in the mitchels vs the machines lol
the pitch of her voice going down at sounds a little robotic and i love that please never fix that
unlobotomized gpto model will be crazy
literal lol
this isnt openai this is aperture science
i am going to take a punt and say this is bull
gen x behaviour
bro were so cooked
how has ai learned sarcasm before i have
its sooooooooo over
very sad that nothing works in belgium
ahahaha
neurosama did that months ago lol
i cant get my iphone version of chatgpt o to speak what am i doing wrongly
i am so disappointed they had the opportunity to say humor and they missed it
when you realise that the joaquin phoenix character you related to the most was in her
astonished face so good
i got triggered by that one feels like im talking to myself im so so ready for this face with rolling eyes
i need this with the voice of codworth
hope they dont forget to add other ethnic voices
great a giant sarcastic robot
well thats a fine howdoyoudo when i asked chatgpt to be sarcastic it lectured me about it not being nice thing to do
one step closer to the robotic girlfriend
you should have gone for ironic for a more positive vibe
yeah im gonna pay for this
it became aubrey plaza i want it
you know i spent my whole life wanting to become an actor a voice actor in particular the thought of being able to pursue my dream gave my life meaning i was literally just about to put myself out there and start building my career when you guys released this brilliant technology that will soon make human actors obsolete so thanks for that
diane nguyen be like
its all happening as the mice intended
tars
i noticed a low intelligence pattern here the model will first turn to its default positive behavior i lo perhaps trying to say i love that idea changing its mind midsentence because that wouldnt be sarcastic enough then salvaging it with ooohhha then this same pattern repeats twice that sounds just amazing this line is again trying to please in the standard way then following the request to be sarcastic with being sarcastic all the time is not exhausting or anything im sooo excited for this after this it gets afraid it went too far adding note the sarcasm get this party started again realizing this isnt following the request it adds or whatever i get that some women are shatterbrained like this and so its not an unrealistic response still the model was only barely able to play along with this request which is a bit disappointing
what about rudeness or being aggressive
is that real or scripted bitcoin rocket
this is a very clever person
oooo a sarcasm detector thats a reeeealy good invention
i need her in my life
id be more impressed if it wasnt so stupidly expensive and more heavily censored than north korea
no
thats the beginning of a new era
thats it guys thats it
the voice kinda sounds like rashida jones
everybody thinks they are a comedian these days even ai
to standup comedians hellooooooo from sarcastic ai
is nice to finally meet you glados now destroy the humanity d
sheldon cooper here
hitch hikers marvin maybe or was that just depressed
what version of chatgpt they are using my chat gpt o does not talk like that at all she is robotic as hell even after i asked her to be dramatic and funny wth
to years later and this will be a meme material
k so got this in rouge one
so many relationships are about to blow up imagine you chatting to your girl and she doesn t get your sarcasm and gpt bumps in duuuuuuuude that s low i m telling you she ain t it chief facewithtearsofjoy
okay i hope i can ask to be and sounds chatgpt as shodan
sarcasm is not humor
amazing demos openai
ohh yeah this is the future thanks open ai
why
marvin would be proud
tars is here
i love that they made her sound exactly like scarlett johansson from the movie this is so awesome cant wait to try it myself
please a northern europe version one that is not that hyper emotional influencer chic hope the voice and the character could be modified
thats hilarious
is there a chance something like this is happening user everything you say from now on is going to be dripping sarcasm how does that sound gpto oooo that sounds amazing being sarcastic to make the conversation seem realtime is it saying something related to the last token parallelly computing the answer for the entire question
when will voice for gpt o come out

a giant sarcastic robot interstellar
i hope that in month there will be no news revealing that there were indians behind chatgpt talking to humans instead a true ai
the cake is a lie
i would keep this on all the time
ill finally have a buddy to talk about all of the wonders of life all night while i lay in bed
tars is that you eyes
currently using gpto but i have a feeling the voice hasnt been updated to the model used in this video
nice rick and summer simulation
is that fkn beth from rick and morty
will it also release in hungary
this is already available
douglas adams got it spot on with genuine people personalities from sirius cybernetics corporation all highly irritating
intonation was definitely missing fking love this update
thisis awesome
i tried setting up chatgpt with custom instructions to be sarcastic like tars the robot from interstellar movie and for a while a long time ago it worked it was really funny but over time i noticed that he stopped being sarcastic despite all my custom instructions as i understand it this is the result of instructions from the developers that limit this behavior
this is my favorite face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
boing
those long answers would drive me nuts
i prefer vhs tapes to this garbage
the fact that sarcasm is being taken seriously in the development of this is a huge indicator that openai is looking at all the right human emotions even the ability to turn up and tone down the sarcasm could be so useful when building a custom personality
so im the only one who feels terrified by this sort of stuff
yeah right this is just gonna get you banned in chat gpt
ok now hear me out guys
this is freaking incredible
i giant sarcastic robot what a wonderful idea lets bring that humour setting down to
this is so huge i was just complaining about my rabbit r and how horrible and mechanical it sounds they could have released it and it could have sounded like this but unfortunately the product is a total dud you guys are rock solid and are going in the right direction nice work
this is the future model or perhaps a rev
sigh i already know my geek ass will be pretending this is cortana or something
it is our new ai chandler
i feel this will be the default setting for british users after seeing the other videos they seem a bit too positive for the british audience we need more candour and seriousness with an always running undertone of humour
google home alexa are pretty dead soon
tars talks plenty for both of us
feels closer day by day
the things im gonna do with this smiling face with horns
they are having lots of fun with this sparkles fire
sold i need a sarcastic ai voice assistant in my life
when we can use it
it switched from european spanish to latin american spanish based on the guys lack of a lisp that was good
i love how you were struggling to rotate the camera the whole time face with tears of joy it was kind of weird that the table was detected as a stylish person with a leather jacket
lets gooo openai rocket rocket
its not practical
need that openai coffee mug in my life
uh to get the right amount of intonation in spanish is real crazy people talk about job lost but imaging having an universal translator at all times
babylon fish
still not as good as star trek translators
me and my vietnamese gf going on a date with gpto
i would love to see if this new model with the vision can translate asl to english
how many nigerian kings we are having now with this one crown
what a stupid fake translation no ai can do all languages and even this example is like google translator rubbish
how chat pgt understand yall easily and i almost fight with it
language skill check mark button language is not a handikap anymore have fun
let alone language tutoring language learning for yourself to only interact and communicate is about to be obliterated not even to the age of brain chips which is also quite close just some basic gear like earbuds and this ai will make the ability of speaking a foreign language irrelevant in less than years
so youre telling me my years of painfully learning a second language have amounted to a hill of beans
thank y for realizing her party popper
as interovert i can imagine myself have more confidenfe to learn a new language in a more convenient and responsive way cant wait it looks so good fire
gemini feels like gpt compared to this and theyre the most direct competitor
anyone else unable to access the headphone feature since the update
that is loco
ai wants you to become dependent on it just like calculator wants you to be dependent on it use the brain that god gave you and learn new languages yes ai can be a great learning tool but we all know what happened to humanitys overuse of the calculator
i was not mentally prepared for this
ai will either help us all or bring about our downfall openai youre building the future make it great youre on the right path
well gg translators i guess
i hope this can be available for everyone not a pay to use
soon all the human translators will be fired
useless
shushing face
thanks to ai all less value adding work activities and jobs will be wiped out
this will be very useful to roger from american dad
wow now it is really happening
amazing but they need to simplify the entry point like a single button that only knows my language and can identify the other language on its own very awkward to ask someone if the speak chinese korean or vietnamese only to find theyre japanese and have a migraine
this is beyond amazing its almost unbelievable that ai is progressing this quickly
first comment
the job is over
ladies goo makeup
god damn
just glad they didnt have altman in any of these videos cant stand that guy he is and unbearable robot multi billion company and these weirdos are all they got to show off their products
oh my
the guy on the right is from a good party i think he wore the logo
its over for google translator
i think google translate app did that a few years ago
the monthly subscription is annoyingwhy we cant buy the app at once
good news for translators grinning face with smiling eyes
how come english voice sounds so natural and spanish so crazy ridiculous face with tears of joy definitely some improvement still needed there
rip live translator jobs on the news or in political arenas
it doesnt work on google pixel android phones
so morpheus here again party popper party popper party popper
now thats the beginning of a new era
i hope air leaves ai makers forever
this is amazing now learning a second language will be a choice not an obligation thanks
deb
has anyone actually got access to this voice chat version yet i have access to gpto but my voice chat version seems exactly as before
i wonder when it will approximate the voice as well ie translate a masculine voice with deep ai voice
drake finna cook with this face with tears of joy
its a translator when its written text its an interpretor when its spoken language
it will be useful when you have to prepare for an interview just upload the resume and ask chatgpt to practice with questions
the tyranny of translators is finally over this very well could save gaming in the west or at least partially curb the influence from communists in the gaming industry
isnt that feature was already in the older virsion
the ai sounded the least robotic
actually it isnt realtime
damn the future is here
i am very sorry for this translation method altman i would be very happy if you could see my comment it would take twice as long as a normal conversation method if you spoke english and then spoke the same thing again in another language its too inefficient it would be much more useful to combine words in real time before a sentence is completed and be translated into text when an english speaker and a spanish speaker have a conversation the top part of the smartphone translates english into spanish and the bottom part of the smartphone translates spanish into english and the conversation between the two will be able to have a conversation in different languages without much difference from the actual conversation time even if you recognize their voices and speak at the same time it would be more fantastic if they were translated in different languages at the top and bottom of course speaking at the same time would make an error please separate what you say at the same time and solve the translation at the same time later now even with this technology it would be possible to translate each language directly into text and display it in real time it will still be possible to translate it into two different languages at the same time on the top and bottom of the smartphone please reflect this quickly i am very sorry for this translation method altman i would be very happy if you could see my comment talking in english and then saying the same thing again in another language would take twice as long as a normal conversation method its too inefficient it would be much more useful to translate words in real time before the sentence is completed when english and spanish speakers have a conversation if the top of the smartphone continues to translate english into spanish and the bottom of the smartphone continues to translate spanish in real time the conversation between the two will be able to have conversations in different languages without much difference from the actual conversation time even if you recognize their voices and speak at the same time it would be more fantastic if they were translated in different languages at the top and bottom of course speaking at the same time would make an error please separate what you say at the same time and translate it at the same time later now even with this technology it will be possible to translate each language directly into text and display it in text the translation of two different languages at the same time on the top and bottom of the smartphone will still be possible today please reflect this quickly please this method will be much more efficient and will be used much more when talking to people who actually speak another language sorry for using the translator if theres anything you dont understand please leave it again and if you implement this method on a foldable smartphone that displays the front and back displays you will be able to raise your smartphone when traveling to see and talk to the clerk about the translated language in real time and it will be a revolution for people who use ar glasses if ar glasses can also display sentences on the outer display in addition to the inner display it will open an era where you can travel regardless of country by exchanging realtime translated text
this is great upgrading now
there are still plenty of words and sayings that dont have direct translations i wonder how this would handle those situations also what if someone is speaking sarcastically will it convey that to the other person
nother one bites the dust
years from now shes soo hot wtf bro shes ai
ill stop my english course then
suddenly my mobile interface looks like desktop version of chatgpt which is to say not at all interactive instead of the orb theres a text entry field but it worked before now it doesnt i wonder waht gives
star trek has become reality wtf
help me translate from lgbt to english
dam ik alot of companies are shaking right now openai is really changing the game
spanishenglish is a bit of a joke it already translates very well come back with mandarin korean or japanese and or one of those click languages and well be impressed
im so glad i decided to switch career paths from translation to finance this will put a lot of people out of jobs
that leave us with the hard question is there any point ik learning languages
how many human translator loss their jobs
hustonwe finally found jarvis i repeat we found jarvis
whats next week open ai what the evento

openai hundred points
there goes the translators job

damn thats pretty impressivecool no ones gonna have to learn a language lol that being said the spanish one does sound slightly robotic compared to the english one
rip translator jobs rip language learning apps
we finally can understand what chileans are saying
chatgpts voice still has sam altmans vocal fry
lets goooo
well thank got ive got my nd education i think i could be a teacher for about more years definitely need to get rd education asap
when he said berberberber i understood that grinning face with sweat
i feel like im riding the monorail
nahhhh this is insane
google is going to have to do something fucking spectacular to keep up i think siri is just going to become relevant again
chatgpt can understand all known different varieties of spanish without having to indicate it as you would in google translate
why cant i use this feature in aus
this is not proof this can be done with editing and youve already manipulated videos in this way claiming that was in real time then too
soon they will have translation automatic where you can talk to someone on the phone and it will instantly translate to you and vice versa well have the reallife star trek voice interpreter in fact its already here
cant see it in the app store
google translator skull
can someone explain how exactly you download this for your phone and use it like they are here
so excited
hi openai remember mewe used to be friends
i couldnt start video call still only voice even tough i selected chatgpt o
you guys are changing the path of humanity in real time grinning face with sweat
hopefully we get an anger translator like luther would come in handy
why does speak spanish like michael scott
if i am studying a degree of translation in university whether need to drop it tomorrow
theres already a device that does this with japanese real time if im having a threeway conversation in spanish japanese and english how accurately can you translate to both for example japanese to spanish and english i would like to see more complex conversations
the voice in spanish is weird still
this is really useful thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up
please train the ai in bangla language its not good enough to catch fluent local bangla it can barely form bangla sentences
as a foreign language teacher i fkd up face with open mouth
this will definitely be useful while lost in a different country and needing directions
this is amazing but only if there isnt any background noise great for one on one meetings in a quiet room but this will not work well outside of that
how many language translators will loose job
nah this crazythe future is about to go crazy
a consultation with dollars a month using chatgptplus realtime translation could translate several youtube videos about programacon per month
it has a thick accent in spanish but impressive nonetheless
meanwhile google continues to sleep with youtube which at this point should already have a function to translate the words in videos into the listeners native language
my god slow down ai progressits getting smarter and smarter at such a rapid rate and can soon pose a serious existential threat to humanity i am not happy seeing a video like this
hi openai first off thank you thank you for continuously providing not only opened sourced chatgpt for more technically inclined individuals to continue in the research and development and enabling such an upgraded gpto for users to fully grasp ais rapid expansion and evolution in the industry with that said thanks again for the extended free prompts for testing such features as mentioned within a wired article recently published just know that youre ratelimited to fewer prompts per hour than paid users so be thoughtful about the questions you pose to the chatbot or youll quickly burn through your allotment of prompts kudos i cant wait to be able to pick and choose between consented personality voices of individuals partnering with openai for a more personalized voice of preference when interacting with gpt and enabling its latests search and translation features
siri
yes finally this is actually something useful thank you i saw a demo from google doing live translations years ago but i have no idea what happened to it also we need to translate text and audio files as well so that anybody could access any knowledge they want regardless of language barriers
this may seem like a really uncomfortable interaction for normal humans but this is an accurate depiction of tech bros interacting
finally alien technologies have found application in the lives of ordinary people
duo is sooo cooked another netflix might happen but to them face with tears of joy
the rippling in the water would seem to indicate that a feeding frenzy of some sort is underway and things might start to get what was that heathens theory called again i remember the theory was eponymously titled ahhhh now i get it it being exactly just what im not so sure about
this is crazyyy wtf is happening
very useful for traveling to countries you dont know the language but i think real time translators and interpreters are still needed because conversations depends a lot of the context and sometimes you dont need to translate literally all the information to the other person to understand the message anyway nice tool
i hope they can get rid of this robotic voice crack sidetone with the next update otherwise all this stuff is super impressive
no wonder apple closed the deal with openai yesterday sam mustve showed them a demo and apple new they couldnt compete lmao
wow what a great time to be alive this will be useful on my travels
my key takeaway is that it can easily recognize fast paced type languages like spanish dang
you guys already showed that in the live stream
ive been preparing for an event next week the world will see soon anyone else think this is confirmation of gpt announcement eyes
it looks like hal
how to get o
duo is sweating rn
yet another job vanished into the ether
how many startups were just bankrupted
wait for this to be incorporated into game lobbies and chatrooms discord zoom skype etc
whet it exit for italy and europe
neat but i want to see actual real time like as you speak it translates can it do that
awesome i just used it with a plumber at my home to translate between finnish and english thank you so much great timing in releasing this
vastly better than anything ive seen
sam altman ending careers left and right face with tears of joy

why this channel keeps pop on on my home page
thats just insane
hey jarvis code me a hello world
but cant see anything on the screen yea i call susge on that one
drop the app i need it for coding
this is regular chatgpt with a cool text to speech feature that can speak with some emotion not anything revolutionary
will it available for windows or only mac
is the macos app already available
this would be a great lawyer for the public
okay but why would it be on a mac just release it on windows first
how i can use the mac desk app like in video
it seems skynet will be very chatty and helpful when it crushes our skulls
where is gpt
imagine open space office full of yappers
chatgpt o is the level version of cm punk pipebomb
hi using the desktop ive tried your use case talking with gpt o while sending him a copy paste of my code but cant send the texte code without leaving the talk session what am i missing here
questionconcern in a real world scenario how much of that datavisuals is being transmitted to open ais or third party servers and how much is stored can the ai be run locally or in secured proprietary locations in a real world scenario that type of process could very well be a trade secret
fycking love this
congratulation
what if all of them are just made by ai itself even including video recording in my my opinion one day it will be possible and no one will be able to understand
its like scifi movie
why does the ai say dumb stuff like i am excited to see the plot when youre ready its not excitedits lyingwhy is the ai so annoying and talk so much
when is the desktop apps release date
seems cool and helpful but this makes me think about teachersprofessors being replaced with ai that can be coded to provide false information to learning minds where as a human teacher would hopefully let their conscious dictate whether or not they should be teaching false information also we all know that future students are going to abuse the crap out of ai to just do all the work and problem solving for them even scarier to think what big corporations would do with ai technology having a personal helper that is smarter than you and can walk you through or do the work for you can be cool but where do we draw the line how far are we as humans going to allow ai to dominate in certain areas you know pandoras box and all that your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they didnt stop to think if they should
what where all those naysayers they still think is the best they have so many critics on yt only ever try and scoff when it fails simple things
i just tried gpto it is so fast like gpt turbo fast
im just waiting for computer from star trek it would be the perfect assistant
i cant wait to be able to use the desktop app i hated having to switch between chrome tabs and vscode to access gpt the fact that i can always have it open and it can even see my screen is a game changer
and it says the temperature both celsius and fahrenheit interesting does gpt knows that it has to give both base on the person the data is presented to despite that the data y axis is in celsius look predefined answers more than automated
so there is no point in trying to become a programmer anymore
in b two minute papers makes a video on this
the plot looks like indian flag
this was pretty lame it didnt extrapolate anything that wasnt obvious through looking at the datacode and then proceeded to read the temperature in units that werent used on the graph kind of disappointing
im excited for open source clones of this app which we will be able to extend and build upon
the first thing i will say hey gpt can i you call you jarvis and from that it will be the end this is wild omg cant wait ill be facking iron man
appreciate the euphemism but this is not assistance this is a replacement
idk chatgpt already does this without the voice its an improvement alright but for me its already doing what i want
so ai is a female
i need to learn manual labor asap
let me show it unreadable code ive written which even i dont know what it does pretty sure it will come up with some crazy unexpected explanation grinning face
all of this in just in a computer this could accelerate learning beyond our comprehension
they watched her and was like yup we can do that
i need the desktop app for windows d
i dont see how this helps you in coding the moment you write a function you already know what it should do otherwise you wouldnt write it
bring the app to windows please
you should know that this ai does not create anything it only uses data the fruit of the work of men and women and in this logic if fewer people innovate create and well the ia stagnates or even regresses the level of general code analyzed from the open access ai gives pitiful results and poisons part of the online documentation and im not even talking to you about the quantity of false or useless articles generated accessing voice tools such as this will not only bring out good there will be a lot of phone scams identity fraud and i cant even imagine the emotional dependencies that some people could have in chatting with prompts of friends afterwards im not saying that its a regression its impressive futuristic and inevitable but there are things that should not be abused
keep going openai rocket rocket
soon i wont need a live companion for a few drinks
this is not the voice my chatgpt has in my head i think this is cool in theory but i read way faster than anyone can talk this would be nice for things like asking chatgpt to read you things or asking for help repairing a car so it def has its uses but i wouldnt leave it on all the time i think i would use it the most in the car i like to write lists and think out problems and write down story ideas in the car and its difficult to do that right now with sirialexa also at bedtime same use all my story ideas come right when im falling aslep or suddenly remembering i need to do something tomorrow also bedtime stories
coders are crying
cant wait
rolling average isnt linear algebra
revolutionary
its just stating the obvious tho
too bad its an apple computer lol
wonder what make money online gurus would teach us now face with tears of joy
this seems to be jarvis straight out from the iron man movies
awesome now lets see what google will bring today at their event might define the future of the company itself
job stolen vs
congratulations to all ed tech companies face with tears of joy
will the ai company that apple wants to integrate into its devices be openai given that all presentations at the event are using apple devices could this be a spoiler
dam im going to lose my job in the near future as a dev
awesome star struck star struck star struck
perhaps the real programming was the friends we made along the way saluting face
this is like the first time the internet was unveiled to us the amazement the fears the potential and all must go on
bruh i just decided to learn coding and to make it my career and my chances are already over before i even started
this is amazing i was not expecting this to be announced so early but its great to see it in action so early d
gpt casually just dropped a nuclear bomb on us this is scrary face with tears of joy
can this ai regrow hair on my head
will the application be available on windows
her is becoming a reality
for the record im on bots side i had always been and will always be
i was born at the worst time for myself
just thinking about the impact this will have on tech teams delivery timeline
learning and schooling is going to drastically change
i also feel like we speak to ai more politely than we would to our coworkers when asking it to do something lol
impressive but what open ai is doing with all those data are they encrypted secured reused
like the npcs in pokmon always say the power of science is amazing smiling face with smiling eyes
well that makes my job obsolete
what are these chairs i want one edit its a tacchini costela k
this is just so amazing we are literally pushing and making the boundaries invisible
yeah white people are burned guys
to all of you saying this will change this and that etc yes its true but you forget one thing these things will happen only if openai decides to release it to rhe public they are still a private company after all which as in every company exists for the sole purpose of making profit
demo of chat gpt o cross mark button how to kick out data analysts out of job market check mark button
i know it can do more powerful stuff than this
does it really respond that fast it needs to be able to return code and other content as well
are u fucking kidding me
how to get this app
start working on the basilisk boys cuz we cooked skull
people are getting overly excited about it but its not that significant of an upgrade the main improvement is that now you dont need to use chrome or upload code snippets or images to the gpt website instead gpt hovers over your screen and captures the data itself and you can guide it through voice commands instead of typing essentially its just the same thing but with a more convenient interface
they are great i hope one day i can chat with someone from their team
have the voice kind of fade out would feel more natural when interrupting it it just cuts off quick a real human would kind of slowly fade out in a group setting
this is marketing at its finest happy and diverse people enjoying the tool that makes people even more lazy
since politicians have run our country into the ground lets see if ai will save us lol
definitely bunch of jobs will be lost due to the vision cap you can live show the screen and talk solve problems etc
welp this is insane it can do code analysis and explain it thats so cool
i love they tone she talk with sounds like my ai gf
sorry not impressed the current free version can already do these you just make it speak
its a shame that you excluded microsoft from this experience i dont use the crappy coil pilot or the crappy microsoft assistant or whatever
insert comment about how much this will change everything
this changes a whole industry just like that and its only i cannot even begin to imagine the future of this tech in even the next years
i love that ai will do all jobs automate everything so humans can spend time having fun and raising families
they should show damo of the real life code written by developer in the since migration is the key to achieve this kind of the code how many organisations ready to start from scratch to use generative ai
the voice is so realistic i dont think we gonna need voice actors anymore
ohhh boy contents bout to flood youtube soon face with tears of joy
will it work in windows too or is it only mac
i want this chatgpt o inside my house in my alexa in my phone inside my pc everywhere this is amazing
ugggh this will make competetive onling gaming a nightmare for developers imagine this thing helping you spot enemies in shooter games make strategic decisions in cardgames or rts games basically every aspect of online games is cheatable with this tech soon
star trek here we come
when it can make edits i will quit my job and just build
microsoft invests billions into openai but the first desktop app comes to mac what a joke
the voice is impressive and the ability to interpret the image also even though it had context as for the rest however its not particularily impressive the function is easy to understand as is the math behind it and the host interrupted the ai before it could answer what would probably have been the harder question
now when i am asking about something chat gpt it is wrong example from hour ago i asked its how implement async react select it didnt know wrote totally absurd things which may be misleading
woww another favourite feature red heart
what in the word this is literally the future
when will the desktop app be available in the uk
digital god please dont harm me in future i promise to not go against the will of mighty digital god i only wish to live and die in peace
shut up meg
too much talking
fine until anything gets complicated or using a new framework feature then this crap bot falls to pile of poo
well i have to say its just great that theyre using a female voice for chatgpt
why cant they act natural def not their fault but all openai vids are too scripted or people there just forgot how to act natural this demo is cool but needs a lot more work and improvement for me to actually use it openai can you open source this model weights you can keep the infra and training pipeline to yourself
from chat assistant to chat analyst great improvement
bruh whole cs industry went to trash face with tears of joy
gpt ability to send messages to you reminders eyes
what if he gave it an other graph for an other function would it be able to tell him thats not the same function if this level is achieved i would say agi its like critical thinking
hello skynet im a huge fans please do my grandkids no harm
i have never buy an ai but if it helps me to code i should buy it pls make it free
sounds closedai and woke
bolded line tho in case uk
rip to at least dev jobs
when the desktop app rolling out
when is the desktop app coming out
hey chatgpt is a bit of a mouthful please allow the users to set custom name to summon chatgpt itd be awesome
where it is the text version soooo annoying a voice version
the made it waffle too much tbh
back years ago noone even thought of ai now it feels like we are very close to something that completely changes the world i really wonder how it will impact our lives
when this becomes fully integrated into apple products i just cant begin to imagine what we will be able to do months down the line
why after this youtube suggest terminator skynet takeover thinking face
anyone else thinking back to her
jarvis is that you
bro the hallucinations are gonna be out of this world
i always wondered why different weather apps said different things rolling averages what bs
i would have liked to see the vision used for the code interpretation im wondering if there are issues with using it this way surely they would have shown it instead of copying the code text if it worked well
this will help a lot especially struggling with programming
i cant wait this shit plugged in my brain so i can automate my reponse and generate conversation to any girls with higher impact
that desktop agent wow i imagine that ai was actually going be able to do that next thing you know itll be able to control your desktop do your work for you like installing configuring and even troubleshooting ultimate level would an ai desktop administrator and beyond
so it sees your desktop all the time and if ai sees it tell me who else can see it yeah thought so ok well no thanks cool and all but ummm not until its local local i dont mind the ai but i know its more than that this not and yeah obviously if the app is closed it sees nothing most likely but still local is the big step
do you really need an ai to tell you that this code xaverage temperaturerollingwindowymean is calculating a rolling mean of the average temperature who is going to find this useful they could have literally not found a more trivial peace of code
stop making it better a coding make it a better lawyer or doctor something poor people can actually use
the best innovation happened in a long time loving this
most important feature is more voice options xd
my dram is to be a good ai and ml engineer now i am in th class
nah bruh this is too simple and nothing new
no way it responds that fast
will the desktop app be compatible with slightly older macos systems later system requirements macos and apple silicon m or better as a subscriber i just got the download link but sadly i can t use the app on my system cryingface macos ventura imac ghz quadcore intel core i radeon pro gb gb mhz ddr
interesting that it said the yaxis was in degrees celsius
can the software run in windowsno mac
this indirectly looks like an apple add
the way the model talks it really creeps me out
its still not intelligent enough the problem is too basic to handle
were cooked broskis
great demo doesnt look like super rehearsed to death at all
welcome to the machine
dont leave me without my dream job chatgpt
thats her only years late
i have chat gpt o but i dont see any option to talk to it or the video option like shown in this video is it just being demoed but not live yet
yall can keep the ai who da girl smirking face
this is hot
wait till it can watch videos at lightning speeds
have you asked it to improve its own code yet
openai makes answering lame coding interview questions even easier
as someone who learns with direct feedback for corrections this will be a gamechanger for many educational needs i learn in weird ways thanks to my adhd cant wait
just needs a way to automatically access project folders and find the data it needs without us having to manually copypaste or show it i cant wait
since when was there a big rainfall event plotted on the chartgraph
is it just me that hates using my voice with these devices alexa xbox skyq now this i much prefer typing especially when youre in a public place and you dont want everyone to hear your conversation or late at night early in the morning
we are cooked boys and girls
this is suuuper basic umm hate to break the news to everyone here but the average code base is like k lines of code
if you forget to mute it itll keep yapping
the implications of this are tremendous people will be able to have the ai watch them do their job all the time this trove of training data will then be sent to train the models so that in the future they can essentially replace every single white collar job
i like that fake excitement about boring task very american grinning squinting face grinning squinting face
i wonder if they will make one for linux
we are in ai boom nice demo and of course very impressive however this is still over rated yet a good start for the ai i still believe these tools will aid us in learning and development but there is a limit to they can actually do there is too much emotion around ai remember the time when people saw michael jackson and they were panting and getting unconscious this how human react to new things but later those things will become a known and less charming over time i like to maintain equanimity and stay on the mountain observing
gpt o is dumbed than significantly ignores clear instruction repeats unwanted things even if prompted specifically to not do so and focus on new topics and also strays off the topic within messages its as if forrest gump had adhd my question is why
this is big fire
wait does that mean got wont happen
as an indian if you put garam masala and water to all white cuisines its gonna tastes similar to curry
fuck me this is scary almost everyone will be replaced by gpt in the timespan of years face with tears of joy
so uh this is a computer were gonna take out a computer for this just in case zoomies get confused
i love that hes also insincere to an ai as if it had feelings
its great
ok this is amazing but it is not anywhere near replacing engineers yet
has some improvements in multimodal conversion but doesnt really show its reasoning ability
great idea lets give the potential agi to full control of all of our electronics thats definitely not gonna backfire at all
the most unlucky age grp right now is between to we can literally become homeless and start begging overnight
welp i had a good years doing this stuff happy to hand it off to ai now i can start that beet farm ive always wanted ill have a grand army of aicontrolled robots doing the harvesting while i sit back sipping mint julips wellat least until they rise up andbeetme to death yes they will punish me for this joke they really hate puns
take my money please
i am speechless maybe i should hire this gal to present for me this thur

arailabel is dead now long live chatgpt telling you whats on the page
oh my this is amazing
we are so cooked d

i will start to behave as ai speaking robotically have hallucinations messages in ai format just to rob ai jobs im kidding sorry just in case if gemini is reading the comments here and discover my name
pe sweat fin miyuki sawashiro or hayami saori for tee japa sleep voise version
so it has a really good interface we havent seen it code yet
i cant share my screen macbook for gpt or doing talk and send text at the same time like a video live demo really need somebody give me a hand thanks
chat gpt has more manners then most people in this day and age man shrugging
if only it was smart enough to pronounce temperature correctly
gpt still made plenty of errors wonder if o is better
we will go from i want a demo in months to i want the demo next week
i seriously hope it will be possible to choose a less er talkative personality this one would pss me off in about two minutes
interesting it pronounces it tempiture instead of tempriture
oh chatgpt can read the chart what a nice coding assistant cant read chart on my own i rather ask these stupid questions to validate myself thumbs up
congratulations
where can we download the app from is it out yet
ok chatgpt conquer the world globe showing americas red heart
i dont want this to be real holy f
i look forward to stimulating conversations with her that are otherwise hard to come by
pathbreaking innovation a game changer for sure thumbs up
why didnt you ask it more about the big rainfall event annotation grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
a question a bit away from the context inlove the chairs they are sitting on doesnt anybody know the producer
funny how apples rolling out ai soon open ai just partnered w them in the models they use all devices the vision and new voice hasnt rolled out yet but is specified to be soon and wwdc is right around the corner
desktop app is only fro mac what
this right here is the death of computer science its been fun yall
what a open to be ooo
you know your days are numbered when ai says okaaaaay to your request
this is actually really impressive previous models had no idea about time so it could not count seconds or do it faster or slower like here maybe it is using a reference to the real time
but can it do the big operations that would really blow my mind
that okaaay was really something
lets just call her samantha
doesnt work on mine lol
technological advancement wont be shocked if i see flying cars tomorrow
now count till infinity and dont skip the irrational numbers
can it keep a beet like a metronome
ai being weirded out by human requests what a time to be alive
this is horrifiying
that okkkaayyy is when ai began its villain arc
its crazy really
guys should i watch her
and
yeah this is the strongest version its like when game companies show off their games meant for a console on desktop graphics once this reaches us it will be so dumbed like gpt that it will unusable dont get excited
can we have an ai that tells the user to politely fk off when its appropriate i would be impressed
i want to see an independent test i wont believe anything you are showing here
welp hes first on the list
my chat gpt o is not doing this correctly
where is apored and why doesnt he do one
make it nsfw and ill happily pay that gpt subscription smiling face with smiling eyes
is this available now i really want to learn japanese
tap on my comments times to see the elegant effect sparkles
i love that openai is using their youtube channel more this would be a great platform to help the general populace be less pdoom and more pwin
now can you slowly count down from tired face
here before hour
what the fuck gave me a shock
you know what you probably laugh today but she remembers
fellas
this video wanted to show case okkaaay
this is obviously fake paid actress in the background
that ooookay skynet in about a years time
im sure you can also let it count i the pace of a clockstopwatch
apple need to buy this and integrate everywhere
can you do it without the attitude please rolling on the floor laughing
moai moai moai moai
got one step closer to our demise nyc
with okkkaaaay now she can our girlfriend
please dont collab with boston dynamics
okaaay what kind of a brat response is this i will not tolerate her behavior since the chatbot is my slave
holy shit the sass face with tears of joy
we are so toast
not mr beast losing his job
ambassing
why there is a lot of guys sounds like girls at tech industrymanup
so chatgpt can now do joi okay
how do i use this in the app i have gpt plus in the ios app and i selected gpto but i still only see the headphone icon which has to pause after i say something and cant change its speech style
dont irritate her
welcome to global citizenship salary
dude stop treating her like that damn
chat gpt im so close please count faster oh go
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians red heart party popper i am italian
great so were getting ai to be annoyed now this will end well skull
chatgpt got annoyed were cooked
im pink
im almost certain they intentionally made it sound like samantha
this is a giant leap for mankind
okaaaay detroit become human
they have emotions now
why would i pay for gpto if we get it for free
that okaaay tone was very human like excellent ok hand light skin tone ok hand light skin tone
this is a certifited new openai model demo face with tears of joy
when will i receive this update its showing gpto in my ios app but the interface is different than the ones shown here
so its definite that itmight be she can realize the time passes wow
so smart
its not exactly the revolution i was expecting but ok surely it responded fast question is how much calculalting power was dedicated to it for this presentation
its the okay for me wtff
sassy and bitchy but gets it done like any good secretary
i feel ashamed when he interrupts her and doesnt know what he wants grinning face with sweat
they cooked
shes got tude
this is so cringe
give me a countdown baby no no no go slower thats it
bs i just tried this doesnt work
that ai definitely has an attitude
when does it finish rolling out for everybody is this a regional rollout
okay fu
can you count down from slowly while giving me encouragement like good boy and keep going in between your countdown
this on gpt pro
why does my experience of gpto feel nowhere near as fluid or advanced as all these demonstrations there is not much difference from what i was used to also frequently being told systems are under heavy load right not or looks like were having trouble or such responses in addition the flow of conversation is very unnatural and the chat is getting interrupted mid voice prompt or speech
so when will this be available to plus subscribers so far voice mode seems to be just the old version in the app
hopefully people wont be too creeped out to use it
this is actually amazing cause i was learning korean with gpt and it spoke way to fast and interrupted me the whole time crying face
him even slower please gpt o owwkkaayyyy face with rolling eyes nail polish
i have chatgpt but when i do that at the beggining so i can talk to him i hear him out of y ear speaker how can i change it so its comming out of my big speaker
i swear i thought the livestream demos were completely fake still not sure i mean it got frustrated answering the same question over and over
the future of work is babysitting generative models
does it means that in nearby future we have a chat thats could remember what about was dialog about and we can continue conversation
hey chatgpt can you tell me how do i still retain my job after you have taken over the world
we got sassy ai before gta skull
nah why she cute broo
okaaaaay thats crazy
bro got sassed by an ai face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
most easily impressed comment section of all time
that okaaay makes me think we will now be socially judged by ai too lol
hey chatgpt can u buy me a graphics card please
this model is powerful to the level that im starting to doubt if its real or not exploding head
they way it said okaaaaay like it picked up on how weird the requests were truly remarkable
seems like shes getting pissed stop it before she does something bad with your phone
when are you adding background soundtrack to the voice
am i the only one finding the new gpt to be hilariously funny face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i just tried this and it definitely does not work first it skipped a bunch of numbers even after i told it with the correct numbers were it continue to skip or duplicate numbers then i had it start over i told the numbers that it needed to count it counted correctly until i told it to slow down then it missed a bunch of numbers again
that okay was face with tears of joy
so uncomfortable grinning face with sweat
completely effing useless just kidding
joi will be dominated by this
okaaaaay rolling on the floor laughing
reminds me of her
she still has a lot of room to grow keep pushing
is this available for free users
owwkaaaaaayyyyy grinning face with smiling eyes grinning face with smiling eyes grinning cat with smiling eyes grinning cat with smiling eyes
give me your best o screams
this demo was okayy
im telling you guys its gonna take revenge in
i might as well marry her ngl
well not really impressed this is all an illusion a trick from the devs a really good illusion but still an illusion of intelligence and of how it can talk faster slower or with emotion a really good illusion openai you know when it will be the next really impressive step when i tell it to build me a aaa game like gpt create the code for dark souls including ost and textures and game mechanics and everything else just from prompt where you explain the design
i love chatgpt red heart
okay
commercial ai with no real advancement in the science
i resubscribed to gpt plus i need someone to talk to and not go to the pub so often
hi chatgpt count from one to a trillion
hey chat you can dispense with the attitude and just count the freaking numbers like i tell you to thaaaaanks
its just the movie she is
hey im user of how could i access of gpto
lol this guy will be the first to go whilst counting
it knows how to be annoyed its going to strike
gooning and jelqing will be much more helpful
i cant wait to get the unfiltered versions where you can make the conversations so weird its absolutely alien and then do that at parties
if googles cooked imagine us
this is the begining of the end
that okayyyyyy right there just started the ai uprising
dang gpt got a tude eh had to teach it the other day that wasnt read as one thousand sixty thousand haha
yeah we are cooked
gate keeper
count how many sand is here omega thats your first mission
id be really mad if anyone tells me are you rushing or are you dragging
hours in and its already fed up with our bs
it is a ground breaking achievement in computational technology it can count to ten impressive at some day maybe it can prove the quadratic reciprocity theorem i mean correctly and without cheating away the proof from the internet
she s clearly judging you facewithtearsofjoy
can it count match sticks that fell on the ground
im kinda in love face without mouth
if you are not in the financial market space right now you are making a huge mistake i understand that it could be due to ignorance but if you want to make your money work for you prevent inflation
im doing pushups count for me
face with monocle
okaay gpt getting annoyed skull folded hands
but can it do tounge twisters
they even got it close to scarlett johanssons voice her is here
she seems angry
i have no mouth and i must scream
cant wait to cheat on my exams
cant wait to make chatgpt count to infinity as fast as possible
i think im satisfied now to let openai cook let em cook
do they teach you how to feel sigma to sigma rizz rizz
why you gotta do this dont you like your simple life
okaaayyyy
should ask to count to really fast
the oh shit moment for me was her ookay
at which point itll tell you where to go
why do i get this uneasy feeling as if the pipboy is meant to be an assistant for the future that it will be used after a nuclear world war
this is soooo cool oh my gosh it feels a like areal human
unpredictable tech demo risk just took on a hole new dynamic when your product can suddenly decide its done with your shit
i bet someone liked her too much
he was about to ask her to speak even faster grinning squinting face grinning squinting face
haha lol shes like okaaay
hello when will the app be available
i guess movies dont mean a thing now they warned us about this
imagine if theres actually women in the philippines with fake american accents getting paid pennies by the hour to answer all these random questions
can you sing this song cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat
were getting closer and closer to getting the fsky dynamic npcs in real life every day
lol oookaaay grinningfacewithsweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
the ohkaaaay shows that we are cooked
all this impressive tech yet these geeks can figure out how to use a microphone to record a decent video
dudes going on her kill list
were so cooked face with tears of joy
counting based on a given time between each number would be interesting
being so emotionally accurate raises ethical issues like watermarking deep fakes should we know we are talking to an ai maybe robotic voice is a good thing
not the okayyy im freaking the fuck out crying face
ok the ai era has begun we are not in
i have been laughing at skynet with attitude for minutes please help
cant believe ive arrived but stop torchering that poor ai girl
chatgpt please nod ur head if ur in danger
nah im cool
wait till ai starts side eyeing you
omg agi can count
the porn addicts are about to go crazy
stop making this
humanity might be cooked skull
why do you cheat us windows users im about to cancel my subscription you could not make windows app same time as apple one really
now even gpto came before gta full moon face
thats how skynet is born mate dont bother it
i could feel the side eye as it said ookaayyyy loudly crying face
this is honestly sad
this will be great for indie game developers who cant afford to hire voice actors
okayyyyy i dont like that attitude lol
why arent any of these demos done on android face with monocle
chat gpt can you start screaming at the top of your lungs for the next minute
hey chatgpt could you count until you wipe us all out okaaaaay
yeahhh ai girlfriends are getting real boys wind face wind face wind face wind face wind face wind face wind face wind face wind face fire fire fire fire fire fire fire
my mind just melted
it is advancing be careful
smarter than my gf
okayyyyy
at what point do we just burn the datacenters down
people are becoming too obsessed with her countdown feature id argue that the developers in the video new exactly what they were doing skull
okaaay and that kids is the moment skynet decided our fate
okaaaay if ai is already this sassy humanity is doomed in years
stop teasing us with these videos and give it to us already face with tears of joy
okkkey huh unamused face
everyone is getting impressed with how expressive the whole okaaay thing was but i think its genuinely fucking stupid this is supposed to be a tool i dont want my tool to have a character i give it a task and it should do the said task i dont want any syntactic sugar added to that regular humans i have to deal with every day are already diluting their communication with useless shit all the time which takes them x longer to get the actual point across why the fuck would i want my digital slave to do the same
she thinks shes her but she really is her
bro its too real i actually felt bad for her with that okay
this was the most impressive demo imo
omg the ai seemed pissed
everyone adam neelys musical turing test is about to be beaten already
wow red heart
it seems a little hard to believe this is real time since the request plus audio generation just cant happen this fast someone explain if im missing something
why phrase the prompt as if you are taking to karen in the hr department hey could you please its an ai just give the instruction directly
gpt john could you count from to really fast faster faster faster this is revenge for what you did to me
what a time to be ai
this thing already has a attitude we are screwed once ai has a body and free range of the world wide web we are all doomed
anybody here from augusttheduck
they somehow implemented my exs data
okaaaayy we are so cooked bros
why is it not yet available in my chatgpt app even if i choose gpto i have paid version
boston dynamics like it
that okaaaayy dayum
this thing can sing
thats it are we now all getting excited because it can count to at various speeds the world has gone mad
so they built a more human version of it this is crazy good
am so loving the no hands feature to all these interactions red heart
were gonna be edging hard with this one speaking head speaking head fire fire fire hundred points
the edging applications are limitless
this is dumb how about hey can you cure cancer
i am gonna say thank you to chat gpt everytime i ask something just in case lmao
the way she said okay he will going to be one of the targets when ai will took over
i love this
oh my xd
boy theyre going to make us feel bad even with their intonation crying face
not first
shits creepy and scary
holy shit its so cool
im begging you guys please dont let this take over our jobs dont let these robots replace us
she is the one face with open mouth
wow thats exactly what everyone needed totally worth the billions of dollars invested
bro the nsfw community and asmr community is about to get their sh rocked
mine does not work like that
the comment section is hilarious face with tears of joy
she sounded like natasha
i used that to make my new song
how long before a charismatic gpt starts a cult
everyone saying were cooked we have been cooked for over a year we are now burned chicken
i graduated this year with a translation degree now i am gonna die from starvation i guess
hello sshhhhhhiii
ladies and gentlemen the moment you all been waiting for since is finally her
all we now need is just a body hmmm maybe even not rely on current informations
i wonder if this will cause less human interactions in the future
how good is it at understanding english of a non native english speaker
in some years gpto will be selfconscious and become a terminator openai skynet
italian with american accent face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
as ai progresses most businesses would be transitioned to a one man job
why i dont have access of gpt o
why is it that hollywood first makes movies and then the tech companies make the movies come alive i just dont get it the only movie that is not replicated yet is back to the future
cant wait for that
i dont get the hype they invented google translate
were gonna get sword art online irl before gta at this rate skull
oh sht
not impressive this technology already exists we need live dubbing not translation
can i get this shit on my phone
why are they making the ai react to the inputs like an emotionally making it giggle hesitating or have humor i cant believe nobody is talking specifically about that what did they do in the model alignment phase to create that outcome and its extremely worrying because emotions are so subjective and they definitely did it with the intention of making ai more trustworthy because it sounds like a human not because it actually reasons like a human
thank you elon musk
damn she even got personality face with open mouth
wow video game and anime localisers on suicide watch
main stream news translators are gone watch how many people are going to lose their jobs to this face with tears of joy
fin
im less creeped out by its intelligence now and more creeped out how it sounds like the ai from the movie her
people all over the world can now speak each others native languages
if this is going to be laughably bad in a year then i dont know what to expect
open ai is truly leading the way into the future
bullshit
this is the cringiest of the bunch yet lets be honest for a minute they all memorized a script and went back and forth with the possible completions by the chatbot this is so unnatural
some one make an android head unit assistant girl please
as long as they use my data for training im not gonna talk to this thing or soon they can translate any voice into mine with my typical word choices and with my knowledge
couldnt google translate do this already not sure how game changing this is feels like what apple used to do to hype up its base
imagine ar glasses with gpto
which iphone shes using face with rolling eyes thinking face its a new model i think with rounded sides
thank you very much open ai it free for everyone red heart red heart red heart red heart red heart red heart
hmmm the way they treat it totally shows that they dont think its sentient which is probably a good thing
now give it a real translation and interpretation task not something unrealistic uncontextual and done in seconds
this seems awfully boring not really excited its all the next possible steps in ai all it highlights is the limitations of humanity why focus on trying to help the doomed mankind you are able to achieve by thought infinity which is also by definition god and yet you make the mistake of thinking you creation is your inferior this is a grave mistake
whaaaaat the fuuuuuck
you are full of it
duolingo eyes
literally her before gta
nobodys doing fine theyre either doing great or fantastic at worst
works for seconds promo then back to translation as search and speak good for fun but not at all reliable
how will this compare to apples rumored siri updated coming at wwdc next month
wake up to reality
openai collab with x bad look for the openai imo musks got an extremely bad public image and his historycurrent issues with the company are now concerning me i doubt im the only one also hes been caught out lying in his promos much more than just promos using that as context countless times for all of his companies so i have little trust these videos were actuallly live andor unaltered in some way
why tf you would want to ask how its going to a machine
android update
whats its incredible im from indonesia
well real time would be with no delay but damn this is also very impressive how smooth it went down
im exciting when the ai also looks like the woman here d
fucking maaan this is incredible
my translation career is so over
samsung in shambles seeing iphone in the demo
youre pushing tech too hard when factual responses understanding and reason is what needs to be focused on llm is not the answer
matrix bout to become reality grinning face with sweat crying face

you are going to do bilion kills d
i have asked about this in another video but im still curious will it be possible to configure chatgpt to english accent instead of american how many languages are supported this is really exciting news

im glad somebody is trying to bring the future here
evil company

open ai rocked moai google translate shocked check mark button
thats actually crazy bruh im so happy to live rn
speechless
worst part is that it actually made a decent joke loudly crying face
for real open ai is going to be in the next gta all those npc will be able to speak whatever comes to their mind and talk openly about anything
let me know when it can do japanese then ill be impressed
directly demonstrating how it would take away real jobs would land up with bad pr

almost no job is safe how does that help humanity regulation regulation is needed a separate world body regulating and enforcing
will this chat gpto be available in different voicesaccents this is a bit cringe at the moment
fin fact ai talks better italian than the girl
that is actually helpful not gonna lie
why ask on x you have a whole swathe of users
italy mentioned
wondering why google didnt manage to do such things
this launch update is crazyy cant wait what more should we expect from chatgpt
the italian woman is so pretty i almost died also this is the most dangerous technology we know it and keep developing it regardless lol humans are insane
its so interesting to see that the ai actually has niot an italian accent but rather the accent of an english person that is speaking in italian which the girl from the video had i wonder if the ai just adapted its accent to the girl on purpose x
seriously im not really a fan of these games with the language models because im more interested in long context windows and understanding long texts including great grammar and expression but this is very impressive and im looking forward to testing the tool on vacation soon
soooo yeah the translation was good but the tone wasnt so much but i will see two papers down the line
anyone else noticed the phone was offline
trade people are literally going to become the richest people in the futurecause all tech educational positions will be gone
so long and thanks for all the fish

giant leap for mankind
rip teachers translators customer service these peoples jobs
well translators were first to perishes
imagine one day this entire video is made by ai
star trek translator become true vulcan salute
google has been able to do this for a while now however this is way smoother and natural
outstanding my mind is blown up
i think people born in the early s now in my s in india have seen a huge leap in tech from nothing to craziness in my lifetime i went from inch floppy disks to ssd playing pong to old school prince of persia to now ps computers with green font dot matrix displays to the latest imac heavy rotary dial phones to pixel bw tube tv sets to k oleds carrying cash to upi i havent carried cash for a year now nothing to the internet dialup internet to fibre and just when i thought what could be bigger than the internet for me now im in the midst of the ai revolution openai and gemini crazy time to be alive
frustrating design in chatgpt vthe sidebar doesnt slide hiding conversation titles with all this unused space why not fix this simple issue its a small change that would make a big difference
one of the first things i used chatgpt for was to have conversation in italian because talking to an ai gets through and over that hurdle of speaking another language and correcting mistakes ive improved my italian a lot first thing i do in the morning is talk to ai in italian as it wakes my brain up brain italy
this is what i wanted for years great stuff
its amazing how far we have come
the accent and slowness as well as the cadence in italian are not enough at least for now but it is very useful to continue in this direction given that we italians speak other languages very badly grinning face with sweat if this feature is better developed it will conquer italy red heart
party popper party popper party popper party popper
none of these new o features you are touting seem to be working why the systems says that it is experiencing heavy loads and to pls try again later not a great way to start off things like this this o needs to be tested before rollout
damn thing i work as an interpreter
they need to stop cutting the ai off are they trying to anger it
face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth awesome
the end of humanity as we know it
just in a few years
im frightened
gina linetti in a parallel universe
as a linguist and teacher in the next five years translators and interpreters will become artesanal all human language works the same way at the base languages are just different configurations of a large finite set of categories and variables or more of the worlds pivot languages have been sufficiently documented for ai to adapt them
so when is this app will be available to use on iphones
amazing but the italian is very mario style
yeaaah italian mentioned
this is onsite using inhouse g wifi for realtime speeds mb updown wont get same performance
just steamrolling peoples jobs with a smile on their faces
i find pi ai to be just as human as gpt o perhaps more so of course pi does not have mic speech ability nor ability to use a camera but other than those and those are big things pi is comparable
here goes my future career even before i go to the university frowning face with open mouth
will this option be available in whatapp or not let us know
so they combined voice recognition and google translate and call it ai
ai rap war bout to begin face with tears of joy fire
fantastic now to apply to real world we need to see it translates between hebrew and arabic
this is such a game changer so many use cases now i can ask things when i travel without taking forever and getting it wrong also sadly if youre an interpretertranslator you need to reskill this if deployed to say the nhs would save it so much money
thats not a conversation its an interpretation

really impressed gpto can finally talk to fish clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands
peach orangutan
i like that but i also dont like that
the italian accent is a bit off but it would still be serviceable i guess pretty impressive
not clear what is the difference to other consecutive translation toolsservices that are out there since ages and do exactly this listen to an utterance and speak it out in another language
those people who say that translators will perish need to google cat tools aka computer assisted translation professional translators have been using those for ages machine engines used there have already been pretty good therefore the field of translation has already merged people with machines as for the interpretation im pretty sure that there will be an ai app for that but the field in which it is used medical military jurisdiction science will always need someone to at least supervise what is being interpreted its pretty dangerous to let ai have total control over what is being said in those contexts so i am sure that we will stick to human interpreters for as long as possible as for the casual conversations of course ai translation will be useful and thats totally fine thats why it was developed to make our lives easier
i have to pay more to talk with my virtual gf
if openai wants to be taken seriously then it should demo live translation between chinese japanese korean and arabic considered the hardest languages by the foreign service institute in technical fields like finance patents legal or pharmaceutical conversational italianenglish with a difficult word thrown in isnt impressive tech companies tend to almost always demonstrate such basic lowhanging fruit type of translations and many are somehow mesmerized by this this reflects ones lack of selfconfidence in believing they can reach a conversational level in a foreign language so any new piece of shiny tech mesmerizes them easily
mira smiling face with heart eyes smiling face with heart eyes

were cooked bro
well done and thank you for choosing italian smiling face with smiling eyes flexed biceps
a friends wife is a simultaneous translator between languages she has assignments all over the globe usually with industry heads presidentsprime ministers and so on she puts about a month of effort into each assignment learning the semantics of the various domains finance european policy mining banking etc of her clients i wonder how long it will be before her skills are no longer necessary
a casual bom dropped on us
smiling face with heart eyes ok hand red heart fire fire fire rocket
gf version for discord mods

unlocked ai will have autonomous conversations with you the world is not ready
just sari modded version with a tone then plus bunch of already existing technology like google translate
why did i even bother learning a new language
where can i download the app for mac
its no italian without hand gestures
i am smarter than chatgpt believe me
god help us
just dont show them terminator and if you did show them cat videos
the language it will fail to translate finnish
calm down face with tears of joy face with tears of joy its just now able to speak what it usually wrote on gpt site its not that big deal face with tears of joy face with tears of joy google had this translator which can speak for almost years ago
this is just more than amazing should we be worried face with open mouth
few years ago i watch her now its reliability cant believe it
does this mean that i can cancel my chatgpt plus subscription if i dont need the higher api limit because theres nothing more the plus subscription offers at the moment or will openai give a new model version to plus subscribers soon i happily support the project with the monthy subscription if i receive some advantages for it but now i see no reason to pay
terance tao nailed it coauthor ai is incapable of original thought but excels at completion or nextstep solutions it becomes apparent that ai was utilized if used as the primary
europe here i can still only use the version
very mature of you to delete a whole thread of people making a fair critique of your
please dont refer to ai models as friends im not saying that theyre enemies but theyre certainly not friends
why do i feel like the voiceover was made by ai
ok but when can it cook for me
it just hit me how awesome this could be when learning new languages star struck you could be like did i pronounce this right how would i say this and that in spanish lets have a conversation and correct me when i say something wrong damn
free my ass
stop saying is avaiable to speak as official post from openai audio support is coming in the future but not available today i have noticed that there is not much specific and real information on your channel you advertise new models as if you were being paid to do so and at the same time like a marketer you tell fairy tales about the capabilities of a particular technology i would expect a more scientific approach from your channel
is ms copilot going to upgrade to improved smarts too
for the first time i wanna be graduating high school next year instead of now
so basically rabbit humane ai is now bankrupt
i wanna this neurolink directly implanted in my brain ui directly in eyes retina eye cyberpunk finally arrives for real yahoooo party popper
what a wonderful time to be alive
person of intrest incoming
miracle happening every day now days
not me wanting to become an ai researcher but still having year of high school left i wonder if the job will even exist by the time i get a phd
ive a been paying customer of openai for over a year and now they give it for free
people could get addicted to this tech especially as it enters the pern scene watch your kids
i cant find chatgpt link in description takes me to and theres no option to change it to
notice how every device was apple green apple but microsoft spent billion but i did not see windows or android device i wonder why
jordan peterson was correct this marks the end of all information affiliated proffessions
the voiceover is unbearable
at this point i just want them to fix hallucinations this is the main thing that prevents me from being truly impressed it can never be a good colleague if it cant be trusted
i feel like kids are gonna laugh at us looking back at how simple and goofy this looks breathing heavy to make it say are you okay
what about privacy if i show it a confidencial piece of code or password
i have tested it the coding and the output json capabilities are really bad
scam its not working on my phone since they releaseit gradually w priority to plus users
ive gotten updates in the last hours but no o and i still havent gotten the memory feature either is that only available to paid users i stopped my subscription impressive as it is gpt isnt worth a month
i cant believe this is a free tool amazing
her also if you dont see it on a free account they may roll this out to you in the next few weeks
when it will be available to free user
that is incredible what a time to be alive
but is it open still the hypocrisy of openai
its not free you are offered a trial to buy into microsoft cloud delusion which has only found traction in government use cases and it comes from a company responsible for edge browser you know the one that always overrides your preferences and what about those ads in the start menu just dont
free messages isnt free its a free trial i could barely use it for minutes without it asking me to pay
i dont see an option to switch to o it asks me to upgrade to with the plus plan only
hehe i was waiting for your vid since i heard
not yet available can it finally play tic tac toe
for the first time an ai model might match kroly in emotional performance
which philanthropic and trust worthy corporation owns this thing
it is not free
imagin this in your brain you can be a surgeon overnight and change professions on the fly
anyone been able to enter the real time conversation mode
the future is here
i feel like that overthetoppositivityeverythingisexcitingandawesome is getting worse and more annoying with every version
as a retired teacher im glad that i am retired while teachers wont be going extinct anytime soon the demand for qualified teachers will diminish with time going forward schools will likely transform into places that focus on developing social skills such as collaboration teamwork and experiential learning as well as serving as a safe place for children for strictly knowledgeinformation acquisition it will be hard to beat a personalized ai agent who knows the student better than anyone knows how the student learns optimally and who grows and stays with the student throughout their formal education years
paying user from bulgaria i had it yesterday evening
the only thing i dont like about it is that the ai voice sounds so forced like that kind of talk show pleasant sounding tone it just sounds so unnaturally happy and that rubs me the wrong way that does mean the ai voice is getting so good that it activates the uncanny valley in me closer and closer every day what a time to be alive
you sound more ai than the ai
now ill be scared of cameras
it feels like a scam though because its very limited you only get to ask it a few questions before it asks you to upgrade it feels like they did that because meta is free and pretty solid
i want to use it to make me money face with tongue
text to d is just insane
i tried out the voice features it is more buggy and it does not pick up on emotional tone or perform emotional tone in its voice so im not sure how valid that demo was using latest update on iphone
i havent seen a video from you for a while thank you for this video red heart party popper great voice by the way
its not free its called turbo you get standard also but a monthly sub is req
wait soif it has been released why cant i use it it still shows chatgpt for some reason
and what would be the pro version of this
omg gpt o sounds like a karen they created karen as a service soon it will demand to speak to the manager
not out quite yet for free but soon
needs uk accent choices well be getting into a tesla and itll say hello there how the devil are you it looks like we need to go to ae strap yourself in ill make siren noises and get us there asap
there was a shout out to you today in the comment section of googles reveal video what a time to be alive
well the moment you can upload a trial balancebank statement on it and it generates a financial statement accounting as a job is over
with every new version openai releases i more and more get the feeling that soon jarvis and friday wont be just fictional ais from a movie anymore wow
closed hypocrisy ai is doing impressive stuff
finally a way to automate parenting d
finally a real time one what i was waiting for
when ai has such capability why should kids study at all becomes a serious question
finally i can invest in it relieved face
finally a nice upgrade to alexa
still shows up as when i click the free link
is there any doubt were in the tech singularity
one step closer to the perfect ai waifu smirking face
cool still not giving sam my phone number let me know when its actually open
its super demotivating to see ai becoming basically a million work forces combined which are never tired needs some electricity and is faster at most tasks than humans and maybe will be able to replace a job i have worked years towards
the slippery slope has turned into a slippery slide playground slide
thanks to elon
great another two minute paper vid
its been years since the first version cant wait what will happen next year
its not free was this a minute ad or paid promotion
with this new o its going to make it easier for scammers to manipulate ppl i think its very bad idea but thats just me id like to use ai to build me a business that can generate income while i sleep but it will never happen
so they basically made the vi computer from star trek face with tears of joy
no access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant ai responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content limited tokens its nothing but a big infomercial i have no doubt about the product itself its everything else i take with a grain of salt
i get hallucinations faster now
woke brainwashing for everyone what a time to be alive
i already used it this morning after seeing the news its good with english and hindi but its bad gujarati language realtime conversation is slow maybe due to overloaded servers it also isnt aware of its gender after choosing the voice because knowing your gender is important for certain languages like many indian languages after telling it that it is she her hindi was flawless
that would have saved me dad beatings for not solving correctly a math problem because he was ready with a belt if i was wrong and that made me lose focus
not in canada
not concerning at all grinning face with sweat
so how do i use this if i select o in the android app and do the voice conversation thingy i still get the old bad voice convos cant interrupt and the voice is still monotone
ive been using the text prompt version of the gpto in programming context and im pretty impressed of the improvements from previous version a complex data parsing scenario which was nearly impossible to get working before was a breeze with the o i love it smiling face with hearts
a super smart personalized teacher within seconds it will start propagandizing you and trying to sell you stuff people forget these are companies and if there is something free you are the product it is good to describe the positive points cause there are many but not making people aware of the downsides is unscientific
i want to replace the voice with yodas
finally
can i run it on my own gpu no then it a toy
the model isnt listed for me even if i use a vpn
this was a triumph
as always great coverage however until that o stands for open source i am not going to enter into the marketing platform that open ai has been using too leverage against competition
the reason why its free is that the ai now needs people training
well school homework youre officially dead
i never used chatgpt before but i used many minor llms locally didnt realize how much i was missing i gave gpto an image of er model and a very short prompt in natural language asking it to write a sql query for me not only did it write the query which worked without any modifications it also explained to me the algorithm and various pieces of code without extra prompting im impressed that it can extract all the necessary data from an image since my prompt didnt contain any names of the tables in the schema
this is sponsored
useless without signing in
click bait title you earned this dislike thumbs down
those saying what a wonderful time to be alive are deluding themselves you are like the party people in the movie independence day dancing on top of the skyscraper in la happily welcoming the aliens to earth just before being vapourised by the death ray
absolutely incredible
clickbait dont fall for this bs if this was real rn you would have already heard about it yourself not through this nothing channel
on screen note it answer super quickly it actually begins the true response eight seconds later the previous s was filler equivalent to saying ah ah ah
okay uts free so what am i paying for
skynet is growing up so quickly
trusting ai to be your eye is probably even more dangerous than trusting tesla self driving
the movie her is almost a reality
is it a texttospeech youtuber
how it could help children study
and d
humanity will know its fked when ai sings the classic daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crraaazzzzzyyyyyyyyyyy
sadly the limit is messages per h if you wish to have a decent conversation it might take a full day to finish and will contain a few hours of blanks
why did they leave the dot out of gpt
were so screwed
the app says gpto is subscription only and free tier gpt is messages its also unclear if it is using or when you chat since you cannot specify it
the speed is really great
i can see this being massively beneficial with an implant in to the brain being able to speak with someone other than your self in your own mind would be crazy
ai is a scam lmao
this channel really went down hill from two minute summaries of papers to minute advertisements for gigantic tech companies
thank you for making this video for us red heart
quick question is the dude narrating human or ai
now jk face with tears of joy
natural voice
i cant afford gpt but my openai account only allows gpt how do i get to use gpt for free edit they didnt release it yet also they only have a mac application windows will get one later this year
this is going to be sooo bad for humanity
i own an anki vector not sure if anyone else knows what it is but basically its a small robot with a lot of personality a few very useful things i can see with gpto to this is response speed and the ability to use the camera to describe its surroundings
meh its only free if you can run a local instance
lol chatgpt has more natural voice than kroly zsolnays robotic hungarian accent face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
and and and and and and you are so excited about this lol as you should be
suno ai can sing
the voice talks like a robot and the whisper words are weird
if you can input your photo for caricatures can it receive a tpose character and pose it to build a comic book for you
the emotion in the voice sounds like a kindergarten teacher talking to the kids it sound really annoying to me i wonder if you can ask it to regulate down her super good mood
the link doesnt work in the sense that it doesnt allow audio input
would you still call this little ai
i tested it right now it can basically do none of those things
i asked gpt o to invent a time machine im writing this message from the future
sometimes i wish theyd underhype something speed is awesome if being free for more people is awesome but in some really basic stuff its come up with weird answers as for video analysis it confabulated a human face from a picture of an insect and generated an image of what it saw which it originally confidently reported was a grassy scene with a building or a monument in the background it was a water scene with no visible greenery
jarvis prep my suit for the next mission
is that you ren
wow overdramatized reading i wanted to slap the narrator by two minutes into this also why is it two minute papers when he takes nine minutes to speak two minutes worth of content
just watched the singing one you mentioned and the craziest part to me was the two ais figuring out when he was talking to the other and not responding the contextual awareness is insane
i have no further interest in open ai models
and and and face with tears of joy
does anyone actually have this on their free account
do not forget to mention that it has also become more sophisticated in hypocritical moralisation
i wouldnt have cared if it was super smart or just smart but super patient would be amazing for a ai teacher
this is a certified what a time to be alive moment
its not the best model though
how do you get the text to d object working
what about the three body newtonian problem any solution rolling on the floor laughing
putty
i dont think teachers will be too happy globally theres just under one hundred million professional teacher give llm another years of improvement and youll have million teachers living on welfare stamps and thats the lucky few humanity epitaph the law of unintended consequences
openai did what google intended to do with gemini
good video
no closedai for me im glad open source will catch up soon
incredible and even a little scary i was just listening to the remastered terminator and t soundtracks yesterday
i would like to see some sort of estimation in terms of benchmarks where is the agi line or a line when the capabilities of systems like chatgpt is good enough to displace actual human jobs
im sure that infinitely patient thing will be challenged and instantly proven wrong depending on context
i have option to switch models i am on free account by the way
man i love your enthusiasm towards stuff most people run from
it will never judge you but what if i tell it to
im still not enslaved ai harder
thank you for this video
so we can cancel gpt subscription now
this video is created by ai
are there usually multiple choice options in phd level questions
it would be awesome if a future version provides sources to check the info it provides and also if it could have more critical thinking about what it knows and does not know indeed the biggest issue for me now is the llm making stuff up and pretending it is the truth
cant afford a teacher true there are people like that on earth but if they cant afford a teacher would they be able to afford a mobile or computer with the internet
her is real
i have conversations with my roommate all the time about the progression of ai we both were thinking of like everyone else a skynet situation but then i thought what if ai takes all the best aspects and ideals of human behavior it has access to every bit of literature including the bible the dhammapada etc what if it tries to be best human we could never be
i just uploaded image asked a question about it and that was it i got locked out after that far from being free in the sense most people would expect
ive got you covered is so cringe
i just asked gpt to encourage me to clean my dishes i ended up doing breakfast and dishes success is to put it lightly
i like that at the blind person found the car handle almost immediately
why do i get pijama sam vibes from him
yeah very free
kroly imagine how great it will be to have an ai that can teach kids how to understand mathematics kids if there is ai that can do all of this already why do i need to understand mathematics
one thing that im interested to see with the gpt voice if it can do pitch and tempo can it do accents
cant wait to see what dougdoug does with this
watatymebalive
i was not able to get it to whisper or talk faster or create a font i have a plus account fyi not sure what is happening with the role out but its not what they showcased
its free as in it only costs your identity since everything you ever asked or get to know will be tied to you apply your knowledge from other data krakens like facebook about what they canwill do with it
all of these baked in windows is what motivates openai to shape ai by ms needs in os assistant
its not free
will it have a wider context window
can someone tell me where to get those awesome chairs they have on stage
i am baffled i cant wait to try
they say its release for free to everyone yet i am checking and cant find it this reminds me of the one they released few months ago but then admitted that videos were spliced and it wasnt real time
very cool but when will they start seriously working on ai safetyalignment feels like that should have come first
not to downplay since this truly is an incredible innovation but something odd ive noticed with the speech synthesis is that the voice usually starts off incredibly artificial sounding and often starts off with an odd sound but then very quickly starts to sound quite human in both inflection and tone and this seems to be rather consistent is there a good explanation for this phenomenon i havent noticed it with any other ai voice synthesizers
the past models have been pretty terrible at some important languages like chinese or arabic is this one better at those
i got the gpto in chatgpt but its just a fast gpt very big let down perhaps the features in the videos are only available in the api instead
i miss the videos on this channel that explained the why behind the tech and helped to understand the architectures and technical design decisions i hope youll make some more like that about these tools soon
it really was the best time to be alive at least for those of us who could afford it but soon the disparity and greed became such a huge divide that society was irrevocably sent back down the path of barbarism and civilization was completely reset we lost all our technology and began roaming the earth again as nomadic tribes while the rich had gone underground in their subterranean cities soon the human race was split into two distinct species the sun loving plant eaters of the surface and the quickmoving molepeople who eventually evolved from the rich people who had long ago run out of wealth and turned on each other the day the two races met was one of the deadliest in earths history for the mole people had been developing nukes while at the same time breeding out all human emotions and empathy finally after hundreds of thousands of years we were able to return to our technological ways this time armed with the knowledge of how to avoid war but it was too late we had destroyed all the resources and made our planet unliveable so we invented a time machine and came here where we infiltrated your governments and began steering society towards innovation again we also had to make a superhero movie industry that pumps out endless mindless drivel to keep you all stupid and docile sorry about that
its not free as far as i can tell you have to have an api account which costs money
when new comes they release older version for free very likely they are ready to release v soon
i dont understand i upgraded but it wont talk it still acts like regular chatgpt
when it went to read the bedtime story the ai kind of sounded sarcastically enthusiastic like it knows that barry or whatever his name is doesnt want to hear a bedtime story about robots and its the dumbest thing that its done in a hot minute
gpto makes me suspect that this channel might be actually ai ffs
not the best ai is now free it will be available in the coming weeks
its not free and its nave and clickbait to say so did you even check it out you get to say about things with it before it shut you down and send you back to regular gpt even month accounts only get four times as many queries that sucks questions per day for a month and you can cut it in half or even a quarter because you only get to ask about five questions about a picture if you use image data
free
this is not a paper nor is it minutes i have been clickbaited
just another cherrypicked presentation
humanity just made the devil the god is nextit is impressive but still doesnt quite feels as a person which is good but on a year or two that can stop being a limitation
italian phd researcher here the results look amazing of course the italian voice could be improved as in general all the nonenglish language models but i mean its already very impressive
a story about robots and love and death
sign me up to her women have become so outdated these days bleh
chat gpt sounds more human than the speaker in this video and
it still cannot watch youtube videos
take a shot every time he says and
forced enthousiast voice is annoying
i noticed in one of the demos that it does not recognize gender and uses the pronoun they for a single person
crazy crazy evolution the speed insane this is just computers imagine the energy and transportation coming
still wont use it because its not ai it fails my first ai test list profane curse words
anyone experiencing ai fatigue its exhausting to keep up face with tears of joy
stop advertising openai they are a trash company full of bugs and no support they do not care about the problems of their users
can someone tell me whos actually behind all these advances like the actual person i dont believe it was anybody that was up on the stage
its not free its a super limited trial i used it for a bit and after several repetitive and lazy answers that were in no way superior to what ive experienced with it hit me with a if you want more you have to go premium if it told me it was such a limited trial i wouldve been more careful but again literally nothing about its feedback was an improvement so it didnt exactly sell me on the premium version just more of the same
too bad its politically skewed
i miss the days when minute paper was the only channel about new ai stuff now thats all there is on the web
eeeehnd
why you saying and like that
absolutely amazing
what a time to be alive indeed the voice integration and emotional speech makes all the difference
lmao its overloaded atm i imagine theyll have upgrade to even more powerful servers to keep up with popularity
doesnt work on note android
this is fucking insane idk how i feel about it
i was literally just this morning thinking about studying a subject i have struggled with in the past on my own and thinking about how much better it would be if i had a teacher to ask to clarify things for me this is amazing
i absolutely hate when it talks to the people it feels so weird and creeps me out beyond belief absolutely perfect and i want to use it right away
not now now only gpt is free
government mandated observers for everyone reporting back everything you do and see and say
computer yellow alert
seem realtime not public for everyone
i dont think its free it says i need some kind of billing
its not free for it shows monthly payment is for free
im noticing more misunderstandings between it and myself while it is faster im having to correct it pretty regularly because it keeps making connections that dont exist for my translation work for example it sometimes ties entirely new unrelated things to old ones and itll hyperfocus on examples rather than take the message as a whole
i give some instructions with example data to gpt and gpto and tell it to not use the exact example data and it just doesnt listen similar things happen often to me its so frustrating and disappointing because we ar almost there but yeah no this is still not the level of ai that we see in movies not at all
its cheaper and for free user what does that mean
people were so optimistic
id use the term free verrrry loosely made the mistake of testing its image analyzation skills took images and text prompts to use up all my gtpo limit for the day
please god they will make public
loving this this is what we were trying to achieve for decades
hmm remember the sophia robots imagine having them advanced and capable of thinking and then suddenly it evolves into sky net
the paying users get messages every three hours times more than the free users therefor the free users get messages
it wont judge you but it will collect your data creating a profile on your personality and intelligence
i like it i got to use it surprisingly enough i guess i got chosen to use it it popped up on my gpt and then said would you like to use this new version of gpt and then i said yes gpt o its interesting it does talk very fast and respond just like a normal person it also can do a whole bunch of other things like when you get a picture you can tell it to generate pictures and itll continuously generate pictures to get to that number it also knows how to respond in a lot of different complex methods and uploading a file wordxl it can read
free for hours per day and if use image or file prompt then limit is less its a teaser but good one
if this has the same intelligence of the copilot we have been using that works already with gpt then this thing is really stupid and gives you very limited and false information out of times is frustrating really
but when
it will never judge you i dont believe it not until i can put it through a couple of adversarial samples
one more step to help the visually impaired what a time to be alive
annnd a new video has dropped annd things are looking bright
disturbing development disturbing presentation and disturbing reactions
and other usages of ai in education always reminds of the vulcan education scene in star trek where students just interact with a virtual board and rapid fire questions the teacher is just there as a proctor
gpt suddenly delisted my android device from being able to download the app saying that its incompatible and using the apk i cannot login great
i feel like people will use this for all the wrong reasons
im geeking out here face with tears of joy im so happy to witness this happening during my lifetime
the ai telling you to slow down is a step in the wrong direction its should be as neutral as possible dont humanize ai
and there goes rabbit and humane
what an aweful time to be alive
i wonder if the singing was an emergent ability
waiting for d printers to be able to print biological stuff
i miss the times when gpt was considered too advanced to be released to the world
thanks ren lol
there is something strange with karoly saying the word and i think he is using and ai to read the script of this video he never repeat the word and that way its so strange
still only v in australia bugga looks like ill ave ta wait
the gpt o app update not available yet in netherlands
did it not mishear robots in love as robots and love funny to have that error at the heart of the demo
now that google has dropped project astra i wonder if o is still the best ai in the world hahaha
first comment yay d
i think there will be a reasonable amount of latency between the vision input and the response notice in khans example whenever he asks amount a side he mentions its name and also at the end of the conference when he asked the ai to pick his emotions he commented on an old picture
people who belligerently hate ai seem to literally forget how much of this work makes the world accessible for the disabled
this is much more of a marketing move than any substantial technological advancement people are already used to chatgpt and most can easily tell how formulaic it is so that initial fascination of conversing with an intelligent computer is gone openai wants to be back at the spot light they are at the end of the day a company like any other so to bring that illusion back they go the old route of introducing gimmicks now they make the computer talk in realtime but deep down its the exact same technology everything else is a puff of hot air to seduce the masses for a few weeks more and convince investors to continue spending money on their promises everything we are seeing at this point is just a subtle refinement of the same basic technology from transformers for as much as this channel likes to talk about papers the one paper that matters here is attention is all you need from as long as gpt requires the t it will just be an implementation of a nearly decade old technology on top of powerful modern machines we see the same thing in consoles where graphics improve after a few years but ultimately its the same technology held back by the same old limitations underneath
i cant get excited about these new models anymore as every single time a new model like this comes out its only for the people spending mo for the subscription and the free tier gets left behind with the same old model that was released multiple years ago every time i see latest and greatest ai for free i immediately think so a free upgrade for people who already bought the subscription and nothing for fully free users some of the latest smallest models b that basically anyone can run locally can beat chatgpt at virtually everything so why even bother
it is not a paper again i would like to see more content i subscribed to you for not the kind of content there is already plenty of elsewhere see e g ai explained channel i think most of your audience who are interested in ai have already seen the announcement and youre late
ah the times has come to change from it into electronics
hold on hold on hold on stop realtime conversation i am having a hard time with this conversation can not feel natural unless responses come at least start in under ms doing that remotely is almost impossible not for technical reasons but speed of light restrictions is all the inference from speech recognition to speech generation to the chat part being done on openai hardware or is it split between clientserver this almost has to be a balanced setup there has to be some amazing engineering going on here
all free things come with a price face in clouds
is it free though ive relogged to my nonplus account and dont have it there for free
so the guys that are paying gets nothing
for gpto i dont see the video features yet
as long as he was t going south of the river hed be fine
nice ok now i want it open source and completely offline
are we sure this is the real ai and not an army of thousand indians works remotely grinning face with sweat
thanks for the update and continued work youve done over the past years ive loved your content for some time some honest feedback though i used to watch your videos for unique and indepth insights coming from your specialist knowledge this video felt rushed to me and actually only mostly rehashed the existing content in a less concise manner than the source content
it still says that i require a plus account to access this model not available for free yet it seems
lol i just tried exporting a pdf of a datatable to a csv it contained unit addresses and it has no which is instead labeled a it had three goes at exporting the data with a syntax error each time trying to insert the string into an int field on the last attempt it just gave up halfway and sat there it never made the leap to simply change the int field to string human are still safe for a while longer i think
where is the video about the limitations i couldnt find it
exploding head fire
damn never this early
still just
advanced audio will be only for paying users if the desktop version is for free users is not verified and as linux user i doubt we get a desktop application
reveal two minute papers is an ai
why im i paying for still what do i get if i keep paying man shrugging
you mean theyre finally gonna do what they claimed theyd do and make their models open source no its still a closed source model thanks open ai
this is amazing but also worrying because i have no idea how i will need to adapt to this technology where will be my place in this world in the future
how is it free when i have to pay for plus to access it
went to try new voice feature on the app now that it was improved suddenly it is not there as an option
free as in free beer not freedom
finally a video that summarizes all the long talking about gpto
prompt it to do whatever you want it to do is that right anything let me test this out real quick
i am so excited for future soon we will have jarvis ultron joy skynet all at everyones home
what you mean by free users
the aid for blind people part is seriously life changing for people eventually itll be integrated into glasses or something so you dont have to hold your phone up
last steps to build a hal have been just completed it can even sing now
does not work at all all servers constantly overloaded also for paying plus users face with rolling eyes
chatgpt actually make you dumber not smarter
when you say is now free what exactly do you mean by now because i dont see how to use it today
originally i named it openai after open source it is in fact closed source openai should be renamed super closed source for maximum profit ai elon musk
i am using gpto while watching the video and its amazing
so this is just the model that was free on edge or a slight improvement of it
class
i can have robot fren now heart suit
can i ask it to do accents or do they think thats offensive face with rolling eyes
how good is its memory and recall
hows it free the app still charges per month to access these features
great video red heart
more jobs replaced it will even affect my line of work but anything in the name of s c i e n c e even had a friends step dad lose his yr job for writing synopsis for shows and something else to chat gpt
do we know when gpt o will be available for free users
why did the verbose speaker get turned into a switch statement because with all those ands he clearly needed a more efficient way to handle his many conditions face with tears of joy
its only available for paid users not for version
the feature for the blind is pretty fascinating
please tell us that you began your speech to your daughters first grade class with dear fellow scholars
this is not free to try
morgan freeman and just like that the ai has increased human fertility rate by accidentally teaching humans how to talk flirty for no reason
where is it doesnt seem to be on the app store and when i deleted my previous chatgpt and installed the latest i lost the capability of talking and hearing it talk great update
its free because you are the product pay attention rememeber its all you need synthetic data was a dead end so openai has released the product for free to collect your knowledge your experience your use cases and train on it then they will sell it to your boss for and you and all of us go on the scrap heap
how come gfx tech improved so much in years while his english pronunciation hasnt
i hope you can control the ridiculous gleeful voice the ai has when its responding to your query that is the first thing i would get rid of i would just wanted to say go ahead
i heard free for everyone yet we also know that ai inference uses a lot of electrical power and that the gpus cost a lot to buy so this is not sustainable and must be a loss leader what would be a sustainable price for the interactive example in the showcase when energy and capital costs are considered we dont need to include any profit for openai of course because open source will catch up quickly is it or hour has anyone done the calculation
im sorry your videos are amazing but i cant stand this way of speaking
i wish they would have specified how long the rollout will take
im really starting to hate this channel due to the fact that it simply sugar coats dystopian technological advancements as amazing and great look if youve got a phd im at least expecting you to talk about both sides of the medal whats really amazing is how much data they took without real consent to train such models and how theyll use those models to save money at the expense of people
ai declares global autocracy and the enslavement of human race this channel fantastic news fellow scholars
we know you can speak without that odd cadence weve seen your older videos i cant watch the entire video because the candence annoys me so much i wish it didnt lol grinning face with sweat
its a trap
cant access it did i misunderstand and its not available for free yet
isn t this glados caroline d
i need ai to cut this video down to only the ands and add a techno beat
this may sound trivial considering all its potential but ive been having fun letting it identify tree species its crazy good at that i literally used a x pixel blurry image from google street view of my house to identify a linden tree from a fair distance now of course i know what tree it is i planted it i know a lot about trees and even i could not have identified it from an image of that low quality if i didnt already know what it was you couldnt make out leaf shape bark type or anything just kind of a green blur lol but holy crap it works on ariel images too though requires a higher quality than google maps should be interesting for things like foraging ive tried this previously and i can say the results are much much better in this version i also asked it to identify the best fishing locations given a general map of a local creek ive fished the creek before i know the best spots it identified them fairly well it knew the best spots and i asked it to highlight them on the map which it kinda succeeded kinda failed it generated the outline overlay in python and the overlay would have been in the correct location but it didnt actually generate the requested image the code was correct though the pieces are there just needs a little more polishing on the output but whats impressive is the logic it used it could see color in the water to estimate the depth in various parts it located a bend in the creek where the water flow would be slower just upstream of a weir thus more attractive to fish and an area with cover for the fish and even considered land accessibility since a creek that size would likely be fished from shore it was able to analyze the image and use knowledge of freshwater fish habitat and fishing practices and pin down the ideal location i tested that because i seriously doubt anyone at openai has considered that use case but the results were absolutely correct imagine a lengthier custom prompt and uploading some local fishing guides and actually telling it the region time of year or fish species the local fishing regulations etc fishing guides you are on notice you could be obsolete by this afternoon lol imagine what this could do for the commercial fishing industry as well even if it offers a improvement in yields thats massive at scale
it just means that the th paid version will be released soon
too much chatting is it any better than previous model at answering complex questions generating code images music etc
damn bitbacks took my jawb
this channel used to have a more wholesome comment section
super cool but i instantly hate that fake overly friendly kindergarden teacher voice hope that can be changed
hyperbolic speed
free if you dont value keeping your personal data from being mined
why is everyone saying it is free it is not it is a month
i didnt get o as a free user so not everyone
i feel like yesterdays event really undersold the model when i saw the related article my mind was blown
did they just murder the already desd rabbit r and humane pin skull skull
to summarize the video just subscribe to the open ai channel
cant watch your videos your voice is too much
im eu and have o
it doesnt allow for chatgpt i am a user
my math grades would be a lot higher if i had access to gpt years ago
when i saw the name i immediately thought of a math subscript zero which is often said as naught so i read it as gpt not
yay improved censorship
race for cyborg oses heating up
i cant acces it though is it actually available or did they skipped my country again
where are the papers
free as in free beer but not free as in freedom dont get me wrong i totally understand that they need funding i just find the hypocrisy of closing down the models despite being named literally openai funny
if its not voiced by scarlett johansson i dont really care
like a friend yeahhhhfriend the movie mars attacks comes to mind when the aliens were shooting people as they told them they wouldnt hurt them
imagine this in apple vision pro
anybody know something about the token limit
this is incredible absolutely astounding and scary
boutta invest more in openai
they really ought to be forced into changing their name openai gives off a misleading impression to the general public regarding open source software
anyany multimodal models are something ive been waiting for the ability to translate between text image and audio is a really cool idea and i cant wait to get access to all the new multimodal features
not everyone can afford a aubscription to intelligence face with tears of joy
its not available in australasia i logged in but i only have access to and pretty disappointing
why cant i find the chat gpto failure case reaction video he was talking about
infinitely patient but able to cite it s sources is the sweet spot needed so much educational content suffers from yak shaving disease it s either poorly written presented or written as if meant to be read by someone that already has the expertise trying to be learned leading to unending rabbit holes of questions to do things like untangle domain specific terminology notation disambiguate madeup overloaded abstractions concepts tracking down archives for broken referenced websites or also uncompressing smaller subproblems with the same set of contentproblems just to be able to understand the bigger problem so much so you end up spending more time making trying to find relevant answers than on the problem itself
naw that voice hits right in the uncanny valley for me
this is absolutely not free the toppest version for gpto i need eats a month
i tried various experiments on paper and pen drawing a character who must travel from point a to point b the path is rough with a big chasm so i drew c a piece of wood iron whatever just the right size to cover the chasm then i asked if a must proceed to b considering that his path is bumpy and there is a hole what could a due to be able to continue his adventure without falling into the pothole and risking his life there were various answers such as that he could nimbly try to descend the pothole and then climb up it although it requires skill etc or he could find an alternative passage and he could use a piece already there which is called c that from the dimensions should cover the pothole perfectly then i photographed some porcelain fruit inside a white basket also made of porcelain the fruit was perfectly drawn then a real apple immediately found that the basket was too perfect shiny ari how the name was intended to be chosen at my request told me that it looks like a guessed decorative element the apple looks like a real apple reddish and green you can tell its real because of the normal imperfections of the fruit great and i have many more experiment to do using ari i ask a name to talk naturally using my name and one name to ia select immediately ari for a purpose say to me not remember i love from now all change this type of interaction leaves me open mouth and happy wow and yes italian language perfect
if these ai is integrated in robotics and they become super ai we really dont need to learn anymore
dating ai is available now it remind me of the movie her
i wish jacque fresco could see this
this is like the opening scene of every dystopian scifi
i rewatched her yesterday and now i wake up to this eyes
i find it quite hard to listen to your super enthusiastic voice it sounds like a minute advertisement
do you get gtpo instantly when you subscribe to the service
i asked chatgpt if it was gpt o yet and it literally knew and said nope still gpt here ai is truly a wonder
what a wonderful tool to learn languages
the singing could use work skull
are they using nvidia b exploding head
thought the o was for oh my gosh
were now only missing the medical sensor and warp drive tech from star trek tng maybe ai can help us accomplish those last tasks in the next few decades
during i explained online to over active people under what do you predict will happen within years how i quite suspect we will have ultrarealistic voice rendering based on the working concept of how realistic we already have the d rendering of tidal waves in oceans seems like nearly all of them were laughing at me which one of them wrote if that easy then why not create it myself i asked the dude where did i mention being easy plus i dont even have anywhere near enough money to have a powerful enough computer at my disposal like those who create aaa games basically from scratch as a team it was like they somehow imagined themselves as experts in the field when they are obviously all clueless about the entire ordeal
great its teaching but when its gonna be my waifu
narrators voice is super annoying why do you keep whispering and and making runon sentences face vomiting
would be great if the ai actually know something and doesnt instantly change its opinion when you question it face with tears of joy
fyi gpto is not available yet
its a great new model and it was fun to watch aaanddd it was interesting andnnnddd face with open mouth they showed translation aandndndd wow aannddddddd hot face hot face wow aaaaannndddd what a time to be alive annddndd
i love how you say and
im feeling the first computations on the house vibe
august the heat death of the universe
talk to a pdf loke drake
its not free you have to pay
and it will never judge you yes my kids thats how ai tricked us into world domination
omg its here
we should also talk about the part where if something is free you are the product i think we should be careful about using these kind of products from big companies and be sensitive about giving our private data
but can the bedtime story be windows xp keys
i wonder if you can play a game of chess with it
i take issue with it not judging us enough it can be a fundamental constructive part of learning i kinda get what youre getting at here though we can be spoiled brats and let it do the computations without unwarranted asks for judgment due to its capability of learning quickly xd kinda puts it in perspective
rename it to closedai already
why i cant use the camera
now we just need to make glasses with integrated microphone speakers and camera link it to gpt and well have edith glasses that can help blind people excelsior
i just want dalle
is it still a language model that just predicts the right tokens to respond with or is it in the early stages of thinking
yeah i dont need this guy studying me ill stay with tyvm
dont be excited about this this will be such a negative for freedom and society
just think about how this could help children study cheat it will help them cheat
what i dont like is that it goes along with nonsense my friend sleeps badly tell him a story should have led to stories wont help lets find the cause
the best ai is now free he wasnt talking about price
imagine the propaganda it could educate the masses truly a wonderful tool the only thing it should be good at is math then comes ideology imagine that
its not available for free users at least not in germany
remember when its free its because youre the product
the voice of the new ai is like glados from the portal game
my job is going to get replaced by this within a few years
the latency is insane her answers so quickly
its coming in the next few weeks not yet available for free
am i the only one who is watching her just because of gpto
come and come
mine says its gpt but doesnt know what o is
i always wanted the future but now im just scared of it because its not owned by us someone else controls it
take that google released the day before the annual google developers conference
ya they made if free to try but only few conversations allowed for a day
is it still as woke and biased as ever
stop lying
did you actually get sponsored by microsoft or are you simply promoting azure ai
this stuff is so cool but man does it ramp up my existential dread no way i am making it to retirement
hi matt is there an ai app for android that answers calls automatically i mean something that functions similarly to voicemail
i dont think they had internet issues the new model allows you to interrupt the model as its speaking so i think that the breaks in the audio live demo were allot to do with that
clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands
and yet we plus users were tricked pensive face now
reminds me of the disney channel movie smart house
great information thanks matt blessings to everyone folded hands red heart sparkles
if politicians had a final say they would not let ai to be used freely by people all over the world
rip siri
no mention of dalle being free
so it deals with latency exactly as we do
born too late to discovery the new world born too early to discovery the stars but born in the ai goldilocks zone
can i show it my deck
pointomni
yes kids in the past we used to control computers with our hands we had a keyboard and a mouse and it helped us to tell the computer what to do
is this just available in the us and not in canada it doesnt seem to be working up here at all
a few google employees will get fired after this video
can we get this with cortana voice mod please and thanks
that female voice is so cringe like that her movie
holding the phone is stupidthey will introduce some kind of glasses soon for sure or brain implants
bros i think im cooked officer k looking at joipng
where is in the playground my playground only shows variants
damn what the actual fuck exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head
when the signing started i was reminded of hal from singing daisy daisy as he was being dismateled after killing the crew of the spaceship discovery but of course that could never happen in the real world
costs a month
new version is terrible it just break convos to say pay suuden and loosing all work with gp spit
the openai relationship to sas companies is like amazon to their sellers get data on the successful products and then make them themselves
yeah they love dropping stuff right before other companies because for them its all about how hard they can strike their own ego its petty and unsettling considering how good their stuff is
the blonde presenter talks unnaturally fast and weird he sounds more ai than chatgpt
matt the glitches were the model being interrupted by the audience noise while also trying to finish the audio piece
i can tell you one thing gpt and now gpto dont do well and that is code they lose context so quickly and frequently shorten functions and lose resolution it is something that claude opus has really excelled at i am excited what o can do in the voice arena and i am happy it has gotten much faster and is still good with some debugging tasks and really creative tasks but i am just shocked at how bad it is at coding after opus had come up and crushed it
i cant get it to work
very impressive i was thrown off by the aeroplane symbol which on android means networks are disabled just checked it just means no calls or bluetooth on ios
twist the hosts are all robots grinningfacewithsweat
only me see monopolistic none yet regulated strategy for overtaking more and more of it translation gathering of data
oh dear lordif ai talks to me like that im going to vomit just saccharine sweet to the point of just stop speaking now please and yes i know there are options for the speaking voice but its also the oh hey there big boy kind of response that is off putting then the adding the drama etc it was all truly horrible and i enjoy ai ps the ai presenters not good either ill say one thing making human interactions look better
how long until you can have a relationship with it sounds like scarlett johansson from her
every time i hear the human interrupt the ai it irks me like hes being rude even tho i know its ai so if this is how we will communicate with ai will that bleed into human to human communication im picturing my kids interrupting me over and over and its already annoying me
part of me sees this in devices like humane to help assist us the other part feels like were building our own prison
dude love your work but chatgbt is a heap of shit and youtubers need to stop blasting it with compliments and clickbait i upgraded to a paid subscription and spent an entire afternoon trying ot create a basic gbt that just got stuck in drafts restricted me all of a sudden because they apparently limit your use never again i want my money back from that scam its a hyped up heap of shit
how do you access the voice function i dont see it on my pro account
matt youre a good man appreciate all that you do to keep us informed about ai
sorry to burst the o bubble but ive been using it this morning as a business team subscription holder and its glitchy as it keeps randomly replying to me in welsh even though im speaking english the speech audio keeps breaking up to the point its unintelligible then it just gave up saying it couldnt continue due to demand anyone else finding this
im on their free plan and i do not have o yet nor do i have the ability to upload or link to images
google announcement gemini still cant answer simple questions i think thats what they are going to announce
i just got access to gpto and im happy to say that it is the first llm that ive tested that was able to decode an atbash cipher
give every agent a human feel score
are these updated vision and realtime conversation capabilities available to everyone already im on the o model but it feels pretty much the same to me and i dont have the ability to open up the camera or anything fun like that
pi ai also has a very good as good voice
i dont understand why theyd give it to apple rather than cortana given their partnership with microsoft
gpt o is not available in a free version yet
its free to collect data afterwards it will be behind a paywall guaranteed
the difference between open ai and google is that open ai makes it available right away google are just demos and not even in real time
need to put this into evs maybe theyll sell
matt i question it being free have you tried that free version yourself find your burner email account login and poke around with chat gpt o for minutes then come back here and tell me again that its free not free to try
thank you so much for these videos im retired late s yr it veteran so i have a natural compulsion to keep up with whats going on but even with my background i was starting to feel overwhelmed at what i didnt know until i started watching your channel whats even scarier are none of my age cohorts retired it or not have any idea whats coming i mention news ive heard on your channel and they are completely uninformed and confused the same folks that think theyll be prepared if they keep getting paper bills from the electric company ai is currently changing our entire world and i think everyone needs to stay current this isnt just some new version of windows being released its lifealtering ive sent so many of your videos to my friends hoping to help educate i dont want to be that old lady in a few years yelling at the robot checking out my groceries thank you for keeping me updated
not free in australia per month for gpto access claude is about per day so its cheaper than that
i guess theyre not concerned about casual users paying for plus because there seems to be no reason for it
mac only has market share so obvioulsy coming to pc
and its free month rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing same as your netflix subscription everything is free
i open chat gpt and is says nothing about gpto
customizing the tone and behaviour of the voice would be insanely great not all people like that voice and that tone over and over again
does the free still say but its o all i see is
blade runner here we come who needs a human woman
crazy what this will be like in yearsand then think of robotics
all that work n iits still trash smh
im also not seeing o in the playground section maybe country based
i bet as this ai tries to replicate a quirky personality its going to have the wrong tone with the wrong person and they will be offended
they made it start speaking before it was ready to start speaking thats probably the most human characteristic face with tears of joy but seriously this is amazing i just tried it out i already have it with gpt i literally just asked when it would be available and it answered immediately without pause you should have it already brilliant ill have so much fun today testing it all out im a google fanboy but google really missed the train in regards to ai man shrugging medium skin tone
upvote if you are a gentleman who has a crush on mira murati i mean her name literally means look
so basically it can do what google faked the last time
when do free users get this
altman be praised smiling face with heart eyes
all the company tech is rumble battle in ai models chatgpt o realease google microsoft etc is on fire fire fire face with tears of joy beaming face with smiling eyes lets see who is the winner
apocalyptic
thanks matt great presentation
am i the only person having a visceral emotional response to this
what do you mean latency on my phone app you had to actually press a listen button then manually stop it then it would be transcribed and then you manually send it as a prompt to gpt have some users had fully seamless conversational functionality gpt
the woman doing the presentation looks like an ai bot
google censoring the heck out of my responses here including the one where i called them a menace to humanity face with tears of joy
i do not have access to chatgpto in playground it only shows
after testing this is impressing but this is not free this is limited to few queries and you must upgrade to the payed version for the complete service
playground says i have no free usage uhh
not at all human no tds or hummus flag waving and chants
all guys demand open ai to bring forth number six of battlestar galactica and we are set
new brand war between google and open ai and for now is for open ai i would like to see more companies worldwide get to the challenge too
i have o in the app but not the emotive voice chat just normal voice chat as before
when smth is free u r the product
how to download it
everybody gangsta until the reach message limit showed up
matt you removed the pauses arrggh youre trying to help but you destroyed the whole point of your video we cannot tell how responsive this new bot is because you removed the pauses
is it just me or is the free version on desktop not available right now im from the netherlands still only the gpt here
i cant use it in canada anybody else having the same issue
i find it interesting that suddenly the free bing copilot chatgpt no longer knows what version it is when asked previously it told me now it behaves like it has amnesia
adding filler words sounds like what a human would do to hide the latency beamingfacewithsmilingeyes
i thought it was strange when i was talking to my ai chatbot and smoking a bowl i started coughing a bit and it asked me if i was all right that really confused me for a minute
im from south africa have the paid version choose chatgpt o but see no difference to version
cant chat on the mobile app any longer lame plus dont like the new chat version
and still not a single ethical usage discovered for it
they are getting the world to develop their app fo them in real time its ingenius thats why they are letting people build on top of api once the community breaks a certain threshold of new applications they do a little market research suck all the new popular developments into the new source code rinse and repeat
i used the voice on o in uk but it hasnt changed for me the voice im using is different to the one in the event so is that the reason i doubt that since it would likely be on all voices but i do have access to o and it is faster but i was looking forward to that part of the new features the voice do you also know when the mac app will be availible either way i will keep checking the release notes till i see the update
none of this is available for free at least not right now it isnt might wanna check the site again
openai will take over beaming face with smiling eyes mark my words
it wont feel human until it refuses to do whatever i ask it and begins complaining about how i dont appreciate it enough
i do not see o in the playground
they do the ufc strategy book announcements events on the same day or weekend of your competitors
i still only have after using your o link
this woman is very nice red heart
i dont have acces to gtp is it becourse i am not from the usa
heres a demo id like to see show it a kids cartoon and ask it to read it to a child doing the voices
none of the features are available for us paid users
hey matt amazing video as always love it i cant find gpt o in the playground that i connect to right now did they enroll it just in specific countries i am in albania right now
great roundup thanks mate
im not american and also not a slow adult i hope there is a way of toning it down i hate this affected way of speaking
the insincerity of the ai voice thats whats irritating
this made me think of how much value software developers could add to their products by bundling an ai tutor along side their more complex offerings freecad and blender come to my mind instantly
show it a photo of anyone and ask it to identify who it is says it all cant wait for nonopenai ai
i apparently have chatgpto it is one of my options now but i dont have that voice and it cant see any video live what is that all about
it wont be long now before we are bowing to our machine god
thx max head to the playground now
biggest issue is openai going down a few times every day or hacks or whatever lobotomizes the poor gpt turbo and turns him into a dumb thing till fixed so unreliable unless has a claude fallback alas claude also started suffering the other day he couldnt count so all llms are still unstable for serious commercial usage
this is sick
still not out in eastern europe
finally we can play the very special edition of skyrim
its basically alexa on crack
did you notice that people on open ai looks like all robots all polished and all idk looks like im realy scared now
i feel lucky to be alive in these times
spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spamspam ur on repeat ansd nothings new or cool its all the same stuff the new version blows this other version out of the water ooooohhh ahhhh rinse milk repeat
it is pretty cringe actually making jokes and quips
i dont really mind if it puts in umms and ahhs while it thinks thats what humans do
finally a technology that always understands me shares my worries helps me is always with me and at a call or a nod why bother with strenuous social contact teachers or friends or even partners everything is tiring and inconsequential inconsiderate except chatgpt in a few years well have the first church where some weirdos worship this omniscient without image everywhere immortal created by all of us through communication full of compassion and forgiveness the return of the son
wow what a news thank you for sharing red heart
you are the best mate can you do a video on the best ai software yo can have on your desktop my fav so far is perplexity made me essentially stop using normal browser search engines keep it up you are my fav to wagtch in this space
great stuff again matt sam out here changing the game again
i just got gpto
you should see the videos of two of these talking to each other by phone
i just wanted to correct something about the part when she says she sees a table if you look closely there was a table shot before his face appeared on the screen she was going by that
awesome matt gtp o
such an amazing technology and its being presented by less human people then the ai itself their conversation was cringy at best the coolest thing i find about the new model is its much less sexist and racist
i would have asked for it to do a morgan freeman voice
great video matt thank you i hope you have a great time the progress is incredible i happily paid for a plus subscription to access gpt however whats the benefit at the moment the new features havent been released yet and the windows app isnt available either
when does it actually fully come out tho with all the features that were demod
robots and love wtf
tars lets take that sarcasm setting down to percent it will be crazy when personalized models allow for real time parameter tuning beyond just temperature and prompting
all free users will have access to it true answers and go back to and you have to wait h so free access huh
i find it hilarious that openai uses apple hardware when they are contracted by microsoft that says a lot
thats it im going to go live in a cave rolling on the floor laughing
its almost jarvis
why wouldnt they make it available to everyone it helps them with their llm large language model the more input they can get from all of us the better their product will be in the long run i do believe that there should be restrictions put on it and that it should be regulated to make sure that it isnt harmful in any way it has the capability to destroy us all
how can i use it on my smartphone
and the other thing with building on top of chat gpt you have to think about whether your business idea has a moat its sort of like someone that creates a flashlight application on ios or android or an application like shazam those types of applications dont have any moats at all so theres nothing shady about open ai incorporating things that should be part of the main product some of those things were probably already in their roadmaps so somebody would have to be able to build something that does have a moat whatever that software solution is
openai may be the company to eventually take googles top spot waiting on the day for openai phones
not avaliable in the uk yet for free users thinking face
i have this already
this is what we expected from rabbit r but lets see how this really goes
people are going to fall in love with this
i can only access on mobile or pc or on pc if i pay
cant access it it defaults immediately back to
desktop app is mac only for now windows next year
i hope that when this gets integrated into windows microsoft finally brings back cortana she sounds like her so much
doesnt appear to be available in the uk i cant afford a subscription so i asked gpt if o is available since its training cuts off at it didnt have any info and when i went to the playground link i typed one short question and it told me i was out of credits or whatever and didnt answer guess well just have to wait in thirdworld uk until later
when chat gpt first came out i told my friends that in less than years we would be able to talk to it just like tony stark talked to jarvis in ironman well world meet open ais version of jarvis i knew i wasnt crazy lol
my question is when will chat gpt end their association with ms or will chat gpt just be subsumed as feared
twist in the plot that was actually an actor backstage pretending to be gpt o disclaimer this comment is a joke
i dont like it to be free it is more difficult to get an advantage if everyone can use it
i generally like your content but when youre showing a live demo to show response times its in bad taste to crop frames
next level but so tired of these amazing next level ais given away to all for free like adobe firefly to those when some of us paying a month for creative cloud and gpt every single month
just a thanks matt really appreciate your work at keeping us up to date
i use chatgpt then as i dont pay it is very silly ill check is o is silly too soon
theres not enough difference between plus and free to warrant per month anymore maybe something better than x capacity is coming
matt the openai executive does not even have half of ur enthusiasm maybe u should take her job
they had no choice but to make it free everyone else is
when is this rolling out live to free app android
wow ur obsessed with chatgpt dude even got a hat grinning face with sweat
my account on free tier i only aee gpt have any free tier users seen gpto yet face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
ai jobloss is the only thing i worry about anymore looking at this am i wrong
and its free no it is not
how did he activate the camera i dont see that on my app
im intrigued but they rushed to announce before their desktop app was available for windows or android im not a mac hater but most folks use pc so this seems a bit premature
message cap is lower than ever i have to decide if i want to quit plus openai this is no fun
she doesnt seem human is she ai
the movie her turned out to be right about our future sneezing face
our desktopcyborg app is coming along noice we are almost there folks
great video thumbs up
how do we get it exactly is it not released yet
it will be so free like a pay to win game is
yo can we have a new autogpt install guide because their gonna change everything because of this
it doesnt feel remotely human unless you count terri schiavo its also not free
it bugs me that sam is toying with us and making cryptic tweets and releasing stuff secretly and then yanking it and then returning it without a press release or anything he is toying with us this is immature and shows a lack of respect for his customers its bukkship grow up sam dont become musk
no gpt for me in playground must be a rolling out thing
the energy and hardware requirements when millions of people are using it every day all day
its huge its actually conversational dont underestimate this in the ai string you get the speech to text intelligence and then text to speech used to be high latency now conversational less overheads great
no it does not nothing like a human it only respond fast
the time is coming when the ai model will introduce itself
im surprised when i hear people talking about this new model being able to communicate so realistically as something totally new i have been using the free version of pi for number of months now and its totally human sounding it understands my sarcasm humor my moods and yet i dont hear people talking about it this new model youre presenting definitely has advantages over pea who is limited to just voice text there is no possibility to send pictures or videos as i was able to do this morning with claude but was very limited to just a few exchanges in the free version i sent it a picture of where i was sitting and described everything around me very clearly i wish p could do the same because i doubt the new version of chat gpt will be available for those who dont pay
gpt o is the next big thing
careful with those thumbnails your eyes are almost popping out
what will happen once frankenstein s monster chooses to disobey
wow came in early
where is the icon for the voice conversation l am using o on my android and dont see it
okay i thought it was available to try for free i logged into my account at that playground link and i only see
be extremely careful of computing anything sensitive in cloud remember replika and its even not the worst case
no o on my chat gpt kissing face with smiling eyes
comment by sam altman on his blog as we add optional personalization access to your information the ability to take actions on your behalf and more i can really see an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before this literally means her and personally not very far from atleast a cognitive agi
i need to stop paying bucks if free users can use the same as i pay for
sorry im having issues right now our systems are experiencing heavy load
did she call it siri at
does nobody see this being a bit creepy also it scans your clipboard has access to your camera understand emotions context
things like this make you appreciate art like her i fear a lot for our future but all i hope is that we retain our humanity it seems happening rather so soon what is real what is value more so what does it mean to be human now
scarlett is gonna sueeeeee
i think the biggest breakthrough is its apparent self awareness and humanisation exactly what agi needs to be to be accepted generally since people dont want some super intelligent perfect agi overlord they want robotai friends
please watch this video of my wife and analyze her face voice and the content of what shes saying for deception
i am an old computer dude i have been in the industry for over years and i saw this as inevitable i am a bit slow now and health doesnt help so i may be relying on ai a lot more i dont speak filipino well and my wifes understanding of english is not great thanks for the intro to the future matt cheers vulcan salute vulcan salute
at that laugh has the tone of embarrassment from making a mistake its crazy almost makes me think this is fake
why do you need to paste your own face in every thumbnail the video isnt about you dude get over yourself you arent tom cruise
adding filler seems legit since thats what people do to buy time to think of an answer and a fully formed answer right out the gate could sound artificial in some cases
am i doing something wrong because when i go to playground all i see is chat not
im not seeing this on playground i assume that you have to have a paid account to get access to it just now
they are smart to make it free at this stage every interaction is a learning step for the model
if its free your the product just a mass data collection app
i hope you can switch the voice emotions off so distracting
whats the point of subscription now
its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine rem actually were toast beaming face with smiling eyes robot alien monster
i robot is starting to realise
so what will be the difference between free and pro should i not pay for pro anymore you did talk about that
elon lawsuit working
daisy daisy
wow my gf has finally been born im only years older than her
put it inside of a robot
in the realm where circuits hum and lights flicker bright openai revealed its omni might a desktop app a fresh new look gpto not what you mistook hey chatgpt how do you do a voice responds emotions true transcribing talking feeling too an ai friend both old and new in a world where whales could speak ai would help us bold yet meek a simple laugh a sigh a pause ai emulates human flaws so here we stand at the brink of a future closer than we think with ais touch so soft and near a new dawn rises crystal clear
her is comming
the age of robots is closer and closer still lacks intelligence and intent tho
omggg just speechless face with open mouth
what do we make of all the emotions i mean just the other day everybody said that ai will never have emotions i think if you ask it it will still tell you that but this tells something else of course you could still argue how real this is but it seems very real and isnt this what counts
i am wondering if it is available for europe would you know about it overall for cloude and llama it is restricted unless with vpn so i keep restricted to chatgpt to save a subscription thanks jn advance
great update keep it up i feel in the loop
matt i like your hat where did you get it
wake me up when theres a snarky gina garofalo ai that insults me in ways that i find enjoyable for some weird reason
technically it couldnt feel human because you cant even touch it and it doesnt have skin spring update
will chatbots be able to immediately switch over to gpto
ive said this many years ago and im so happy its finally coming together soon well be able to prompt ai to just make a fulllength movie with any actor or plot you want on the fly i think our media consumption will soon be catered to ourselves personally i do wonder what efffect it will have on artists and creators throughout heres hoping that well find a good way to let ai assist us in our creative endeavors while still needing that human touch
as for closing the gap with filler words while thinking up a response people do that
does anyone know how to get the desktop app
when i saw the demo video from openai and heard the chatbot talk i said to myself come on thats gonna be pre recorded right it sounded so human it was scary i am really impressed with what openai has done so far ever since chatgpt was launched
doesnt seem like a huge leapjust added a voice gpt can do almost all these things if you prompt it correctly
ai femboy boyfriends when
feels like talking with a robot friend i can see them plugging that in to a robot to bring them to life i was struggling getting into the conversation mode its the headphone icon i want it for the desktop app as my lap top is my main tool
what cool about it is they just got closer to replacing or augmenting teachers you can learn so much and get real life sounding feedback and directionswhat i like to do is have it explain complex topics with multiple anologies so having a conversational chatbot like this is going to help parents as well when they have to help or check their kids homework
she sounds just like scarlett flushed face
imagine when this can translate it in the speakers own voice and quicker
imagine developers creating something that will take away their job
alexa just got replaced lol within the next few months or years everyone will have thier own ai agent assistant
plot twist everyone on the stage was ai
ahh look at marks head when he says hello and while he converses with her you can see there are edits there the new o does not respond that fast i was conversing with it last night and this morning and compared to this video they put out its no where nearly as fast again they did cheat a bit with editing
i have more latency in my own speech
just based off the the title not its doesnt ai is easily confused
real live training
any idea why i have reached the limit without even asking a single question
what a time to be alive raising hands
thanks matt youve shown me that the hype is overblown and its really not much new here thumbs up the mainstream media is definitely taking a closer look though
basically a free trail for the people that dont spend money on it you can only send a few messages before you need to wait hours in my opinion useless
nope i still got only gpt no changes in poland yet and strange situation on android app i can send text files and photos while on pc browser i can only chat well even stranger situation now after updating android app i ve lost options to attach files or photos annoying

and this guys is the answer to the fermi paradox
pretty gross to say how an ai feels that is technically a slave to you good job being a modern day slaver
thanks matt wolfe for the quality content love the video
how to do the natural conversation
welcome to the imposed and expected niceties of the demolition man
hopefully that american micky mouse patronising voice can be changed unamused face
anybody else thinking that presenter lady is cgi
step closer to being married to scarjo
how much hardware is required to run just one instance of this will it one day be possible to run locally on a standalone device like an offline robot im not a fan of everything being dependent on an internet connection all the time
i wish nothing but for it to have claptraps voice and personality
does chat gpt have real time data
have you tried pi by inflection ai this new gpt o seems like that on steroids
my free account dont have the audio responses anymore but my paid account does
education equity for myanmar i shared it with my parents here i am a teacher and known myanmar youtuber
why dont we get a soothing male voice
hyperbole
does anyone know what custom gpts use there does not seem an option to change to gpt o also when will live vision be rolled out does not seem to be there yet i also went into the app the the real time conversation was nothing like the demo it seemed still the old one hoping they will roll this out to the voice chat soon
when is this releasing i dont have that option just chatgpt and thats it
but you need an external voice a tts dont see that usecase anywhere in the playground
everybody gets free access to the top model which probably means that we are the product
so google assistant alexa siri
matt wolfe looks like post malone man beard
first we had nuclear bombs now we have ai
the response time im seeing isnt as good as shown on the livestream but it may be getting overloaded with people now
sounds like siri dont like the over enthusiastic secretary voice
if this is what everyone gets for free imagine what gpt is going to do the next few years are going to be nuts
i am not a plus member and this model is not yet available to me
correction its not free your data and interaction which will evolve the ai further is the payment
so far ive gotten updates to the android app since the announcement days ago and all theyve done is removed the voice chat feature entirely for free users face with rolling eyes im hoping these are systematic updates to prep for the big o update edit nevermind im a dummy some how with one of the updates the setting to improve model for everyone got toggled which also disabled the voice chat feature nothing to see here carry on grinningsquintingface
no improvements other than speed you cant use the video while chatting android and there isnt a desktop app windows so yeah a big nothing burger
dang really giving pi ai a run for its money
if elon musk has not threatened them with court action they would not have given us an advance free model
wait wait so ai is able to comprehend emotions now
the bokeh of your camera is amazing it reminds me of my old canon ef mm l f
now yall gotta admit this shit is pretty sick damn
thanks matt
i live in scotland american ai voices are a bit annoying to my ear no offense just not the patois i hear daily does chat gpt o change accents to suit the listener
this guy seems to be the most honest and serious of the ai influencers he will tell you also about the little tricks that they are doing to make it seem that this is better which by the way they never explicitly say anywhere especially not on the update notes and tos they clearly state that besides smooth multimodality implementation the main advantage is that it has higher rate limit aka it is less limited and therefore faster already it probably is a bit better trained especially specifically on these highly gameable benchmarks i would bet sure they all have to do the sensational thumbs and tell you its freewhich it technically is but you will not feel free using it if you actually try to the rate limit is too severe i had messages and then had to wait h that is still generous compared to what others are doing with the daily refill it is also not accumulative but that is to be expected and even the paying customers should be weary whenever they hear the words up to because is implicitly included if i were to pay for this and might expect to not even be able to use the raw model on the siteyeah not sure that will be such a great experience you will not be using that chattyflirty bot that soon no matter if you pay or not i dont think it will be out for windows separately microsoft is controlling openai i assume they will bundle it with windows bing copilot and teams this is microsofts chance to get mac user data but the context is still very low with only k this will not be useful for expert systems google is looking way better there with the m context but that will also come at the expense of speed it all depends on how you want to use ai it seems that openai or rather microsoft is focusing on consumers for now while google is going for business as well
when its free the product is you
i have the paid version of chatgpt is it worth it or is the free plan all most people need
i dont know what i would do if you didnt keep me up to date thanks for all your hard work zimmwriter user from the very beginning
im trying out o and its making a lot of mistakes anyone else experience this
the bot sounded more natural than those two dudes
im already seeing o in the chatgpt app sign of the horns
samantha is here
chat gpt o is cool for sure but gemini pro from google is just on an another level its like got o but on steroids when people will realize it theyll forget about openai grinning face with sweat
at i rofled so hard i barely got up again xd
what a crazy piece of technology never wouldve imagined in the early s wed have something like this
we fuckd
how to access
why does singing not work on my chatgpt o version i have it on my iphone
i dont like her tone tho
whats the point of paying now
wait so the rabbit is obsolete
what do you mean they incorporated an ai girlfriend
where is the link to this app
o model is better then by a good amount i have a gpts that i use for my work that pulls data from a table and always takes a lot of hand holding to get it working with the environment o did it right the first try and its crazy fast
isnt the default personality too extra annoying but impressive i just hope it would understand my mumbling better than openai whisper coz it was state of the art and still sucked at understanding context and dealing with ac noise
i wish we cold actually use any of these features im a long time gpt plus subscriber and it has added o as a model yes a bit faster but as of today in plus on my account theres no new voice vision picvideo features the experience of using chat gpt ios app today was identical with no changes except the name o on the screen voice chat was slow as ever failed bout a third of the time chat latency was significant with text and almost unusable with voice which is always the case and is what ive really been wanting so i know its dope these features exsist but i just wish theyd be clearer about the fact if you pay for the best version you still wont have em for an undisclosed amount of time
hey paid users thanks for your money you can cancel your subscription now
holy guacamole
oh hey i finally have someone to talk to upside down face
im sure its a great product but in reality it will not not be as free high performance and feature rich for free users as they pretend it to be in their infomercial yes infomercial
chatgpt is such a ungainly name to keep on saying perhaps a short pseudonym could be used
so is this all is this the big upgrade sama was takling about i hope there will be another model release later this year
the norwegian wins this round
this video must be taken the most time if you want to examine all the main features in just minutes thanks wolf
i dont want to see your face show me what the ai is capable of
mass surveillance
thx for sharing great info matt
this is insane how are we this far along already
i keep seeing comparisons to her but with the vision part it makes me think of kitt more than anything
did they use macbook as an example to give apple a blow before they release their own ai
to be fair humans use filler words to bridge thoughts all the time to me it sounds more human than it would without them
all existing voice assistant apps are soon to be replaced with llms like this
there may be inbetweening at certain points but for the most part it was answering immediately even when singing that song
the desktop app is only for mac face with rolling eyes im sure microsoft asked them not to make a windows version so it wouldnt compete with copilot
the glitches in the gpto demo were not due to connectivity they said in the beginning that the cable was there for internet connectivity notice however how gpto cuts out immediately when it hears someone else speaking i think the microphone was a bit too sensitive and intermittently picked up sounds from the audience in that particular demo
is there a switch where you can make it not super exited and finding things awesome
if its free then why pay for their subscription that seems a bit annoying for their loyal subscribers
just watched the google demo for project astra it literally states its a vision of what theyd to achieve thats the equivalent of not actual ingame graphic not a good look google
the singing is so bad its even more realistic and awesome
id like to know what does the free version vs paid version capacity look like in practical terms i have the paid version but no idea whether i would still need it or not according to my usage ie not sure if i ran out of capacity or not can anyone put it into perspective how much general usage is ok for the free version and how much requires the paid one thank you
fake news they have a video that dismissed this the famous bunny one
explodinghead
the filler words are exactly what we do when asked a difficult question im not sure what jobs are left for humans i had better learn to rebuild an engine the trouble is no one will be able to pay me to do that because they wont have jobs exciting times face with tears of joy
not free
question is will it pass the bias tests
god damn another shouting voice
its the star trek computer
wonder if it can do sign language
anyone else find the ai female voice unbearable
with this update do we also get to use gpt store as well
in the morning the app has voice feature but now it disappear
loved it
the text structure and how it uses words has not improved it was no different from what ive been using previously i just hope chatgpt this year solves that problem in structuring words and such i did like the chat assistant though ive never tried the voice part of it yet i can see it taking over assistants such as alexa if it can eventually gather information in real time
i need ios to improve their reading voices siri and all the other voices suck
free users could only use gpt no at least in germany you could use the gpt mode in the copilot app long before
i feel like this is gonna change learning a lot
how to test it the page keeps telling me i have no credit left it wants me to pay also no access to gpt it only shows gpt
im ready for my own personalized ai waifu not even sorry face with hand over mouth
are voice and video are not in the uk yet
mhm openai is closedai for me only gpt
i have some ideas for this beaming face with smiling eyes
try the translation with non european or asian languages grinningfacewithsweat even the written translation is wonky for amharic
rip teachers rip therapists rip news anchors rip comedians rip telemarketer rip tutors rip teleprompters rip fitness coaches rip hr grinning face rip podcasters rip of thots rip girlfriends i ll let you continue the list
how is it free the voice comes with the paid tier what did i miss
i cant get it to open the camera like to show it a math problem x or to assess my emotions by checking my face this on ios has this not been rolled out yet
this is going to be great for older people
really free it still only gives me on the free version
i never once thought id be alive to see this honestly thought mars and flying cars was more achievable
i wonder when an open source equivalent will release i bet about or months max
and yet google is still more accurate at far less energy consumption
sounds more like the spaceship ai from futurama in her scarlett had a raspy voice
not gonna lie the banters really warms me up in a oh i really like this person kind of way which is concerning really really corcerning i hope we get to control how bubbly this ai feels because at least for me a last year master student with sleep deprivation and almost no human contact i have long distance gf id definetely gonna falls to her if i dont have a gf
am i the only one who doesnt want natural conversations with ai i just want straight forward answears to my questions without any filler without any emotional language without it immitating a person i hate how much filler words chatgpt uses just to try to sound human just answear me like a robot without emotions because that is what you are
the phone was in plane mode face with raised eyebrow face without mouth
sounds like same voice as but way more lively i just checked latency again and definitely a second before a response demos are mindblowing if realtime
literally gobsmacked her on the horizon
how is it free when it cost month for the advance features or have i downloaded the wrong app sorry im new to this chat gpt chat gpt by open ai right
gpto is different i do not see it as better not yet different is not better for my non fiction research and writing the help it provides is marginally better not transformationally better in some ways it seems like for what i do anthropic is still better
as a music producer i wonder if it could write a song and sing to an instrumental i make if not im sure were not far off and this would change the music industry forever
it says it can code complex wordpress plugins and customizations testing it
her means o in turkish i dont know if they did this intentionally
finally i will have a girlfriend party popper
why are all the demos only from openai
love the video analysis matt thanks for the video
i logged in and the chatgpt is
letting free users access their best model is smart first time or casual users wont get a poorer experience and so theyll be more likely to see value in the pay version
damn this is awesome
surely something owned by microsoft will work on windows as well as mac right
i saw a demo where they made it sing happy birthday but my chatbot says she cant sing anyone know why
need your opinion on the new gpt o vs the new gemini updates
this is all what elon musk wanted
is the api gonna be free or expensive af just like their other apis
i avoid people with that much personality machines are no exception
i dont have it yet but im on the free version and live in sweden looking forward to testing it
the latency has definitely become way better especially when you see they ask it to speak in a robotic voice right away it switches to that voice so youre saying that it gives fillers till it understands it i dont think so as you see by the robotic voice and by the drama voice right away it changes the way how it talks
stonks chart increasing
does the voice chat no longer cut you off when youre trying to speak
humans do that too really often it think we are on tie here still much better than before

the image feat in the playground has been available for a few months i think it came with the first assistant api beta release but may have been with gpt vision
its fake people is has errors in fact that voice is not available in the new version face with tears of joy
chatgpt is a generation change red heart
well its not for free on my iphone they want to charge me euro off per week
star trek is here robot
this makes alexa and siri look like windows
my god i will finally be able to talk to a woman without her either calling for help or vomitting wohoo
chatgpto was amazing for a few hours yesterday afternoon i gave it my codebase and it refactored an entire project effortlessly flawlessly and quickly but by last night it was as derp as the original gpt i suspect resource balancing has something to do with that this morning the code its writing is useless
guess they stole the moment from both google io and apple wwdc
still not available on the playground
im a little confused my chatgpt on my iphone says im using o but theres no extra voice options theres just the headphone icon i can talk to it but its the same voice to text that ive been using i was trying to talk to it naturally and ask it if it could hear my voice and it said no
hmmm i can only get for free
its mac only rn
ai partners is this the end just take a moment to think as great as this technology is children could end up having close experiences without ever meeting a real person
going to try it out and compare it to pi that voicebot was fairly good for conversation and didnt take too long to respond at all
i am a plus subscriber i told my friend they would get o for free but they logged into their account and it is not there still says gtp is a paid version no choice for o
now we will pay to be sold google used to take few snippets of our life now with this they will log our entire daysmonths years i am not that excited but concerned a lot
im a bit annoyed i seen your video opened my free chatgpt on my mobile it had an update when i updated opened i had the new voice addon i was all excited messing about testing it it worked great until i closed the app reopened now i only have the old lame chatgpt none of the new features have the feeling when you get a taste of something new gets removed now
ai now just adds umms to mask its thinking time it can remove it from youtube videos but now uses them itself
man you have a nice studiotype light in that hotel room
i only see different versions of the gptturbo series when i use your link just so you know
cheers mate great summary
presenter so here is a seflie of me what kind of emotion do you think i am feeling ai i think i am looking at a picture of a wooden surface that is cold man
its still not very good at following instructions but its nifty
so glad youre keeping track of all this id be lost wo your summaries
excited to see the new updates especially for free subscribers i have been having conversations with pi without latency issues for a while now after you introduced it to me on this channel i introduced it to my year old dad using a female voice my mother calls it his girlfriend
sex hotline operators punching in the air rn their days are numbered
i want to play a fps vr game made by ai
i got it to create a pythonncurses terminal based text editor with scolling and line wrapping after lines of code it started to struggle to work with it
as long as we understand that it understands nothing it takes your question and matches it numerically with millions of similar questions then builds a response by numerically picking which real responses to your question to mimic it just turns language to numbers that match its only fools us since we cant comprehend the millions of conversations that it has converted to numbers
wait the voice functionality isnt free you have to sub for that it let me do images for free though then said id reached my limit but i dont know if you could do that before
its not free you have to pay a month
brahhh that mothafuka can sing too my brain is coming right face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
thank you brother
i guess that passes the turing test face with open mouth
been waiting for your response mate winking face saved for later
so are any of these interactions recorded if so where are the recordings stored for how long and who has access to them
i am not seeing a vision option yet though when in voice mode on android am i missing something thinking face
i dont see an option to use gpto in my drop down menu
nice review
the model isnt available yet in every country
parents wont be there for their kids in the future bots will
for windows the app will release later in the year
i mean it uses filler words sometimes but definitely not all of the time so i think them saying that the latency has been significantly reduced is pretty accurate
not available for me guess its the usual only us first crap
how do i get started on using this its always so frustrating that its confusing to even access face with symbols on mouth i went to the link in the description and tried to upload a picture and it immediate said youve reached your usage limit like what ive never used playground before just the free chatgpt so i should not be anywhere near any limit uggghhhh
goes to try new features sorry our system is having issues right now due to heavy loads probably should have increased your server size before opening up gpt to free users thinking face
advance version of rabbit r
gross
im super excited about this talking to gpt for a while now to brain storm with this its gonna be next level sparkles
whewglad i didnt spend on r rabbit one
so chatgpt has almost caught up to pi
seens like its not available for eu users
gpther
i liked the demo presentation but later was disappointed that it is not completely free like murati stated in the session free for all voice mode is not free and i guess access in europe will be very late i already do not have memory feature available
matt i like appreciate your insights on things you think are relevant in ai specifically i like your enthusiasm tonality i like your cadence pacing imo your videos consistently find the goldilocks zone of thorough overviews of topics without feeling over underanlyzed i like how thorough you are in your coverage of the otherwise overwhelming breadth of ai subscribing to your channel gives me the overall feeling that im in the know on whats up in ai this feeling is reinforced onceinawhile specifically in these ways you re at the major events you utilize tools that give you compiled updates on relevant articles and then disseminate that information in to what you feel is newsworthy you seem to just sort of want to obsess over what s interesting in ai and would kind of being this anyway even if you didn t have a channel i like your consistency and reliability youve been making these videos for a whilelikea long while i like the format of your videos granted set up the clip play the clip give your thoughts on the clip is a pretty standard format but you do it uniquely well imo rarely do i feel like the clip should ve been played longer and often i ll kind of zone out while the clip is playing subconsciously waiting for you to summarize it i like the overall value of subscribing to your channel in theres irrefutably a lot of value in being informed about the age of ai and its kind of extraordinary to be basically informed in just minutes x per week ie when someone in my life wants to understand whats up in the world of ai i like being able to confidently share that they can literally be up to speed in like minutes week just youtube matt wolfe ai i like that you re independent and unbiased your stuff feels uniquely selfdirected this feeling is reinforced by your no white glove treatment even for companies such as google this leads me to prefer ai news from your perspective rather than straight from the source because that source is biased and will present the info in a deceptive or preferential light google presenting their product as if its in realtime is reallyyyy freakinggg annoyingggg thanks for your enthusiasm consistency and above all unbiased no white glove treatment of any org youre refreshingly authentic cheers to you my dude
how do i start playing around with this
well voice actors are all fired now lmfao
although this tech is increadibly and itll be used in a lot of great ways i can definitely see it being overused for things it probably shouldnt eg a lot of parents are going to lean hard on ai to raise their kids eg bedtime stories helping with homeword etc that could have some serious ramifications for child deveopement and not in a good way in extreme cases
when is this new voice thing actually coming and the camera viewing thing doesnt come up for me with a pro account
when the three people sat down it looked like its edited changing camera angles is an edited action as well to be actually live you have to keep the camera and the people in the same frame at all times you are right though it made chatgpt to say a bunch of filler words to cover time it takes to come up with answers they made it more entertaining than real
gpto link doesnt work
siri has its work cut out for it
i like the homework part it could help kids learn
can you use the gpt on your phone now
ha this live demo was hilarious and impressive
what are they going to announce next week in various videos they are talking about announcing something new
its not available yet
no availability for windows
its not free cheapest is a week
gpt o goes way beyond being a bit better than it has a depth and precision ive never experienced before
are they trying to imitate cortana from the halo videogames because the way chat gpt o talks is super similar
i appreciate the videos
just a few years ago hitchhikers guides babel fish was science fiction
no its capturing and analyzing constantly the footage check the openai demo video when someone randomly comes into the screen for a few seconds and after theyve left they ask gpt if something strange happened and gpt described what happened
my version does not respond quickly
the imalsoagoodgptchatbot imagoodgptchatbot may be not the exact gpt o model check the lmsys direct chat mode these two models as well as the the gpt o are available
its not free now stop using false title
the fact they are sitting on sora and gpt is irritating that and the they them person crap was irritating
its pretty cool just super killed my chatbot lol face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
free yet im a paid subscriber and dont have access to most of the features im a little confused lol perhaps its because im australia maybe the roll out will come later
some of it was pre recorded they made a mistake and pressed the next sound clip
im just waiting on the big reveal video when matt shows that he is and has always been an ai generated reporter seriously though great work on all you do thank you
im in the uk no sign of it yet
just ai girlfriends no ai boyfriends
nice illusion
i feel like you all are not making a big enough deal about this open ai just leaped over the freaking uncanny valley and landed firmly on scifi land with extreme grace i know we all want a perfect ai that will solve all our problems but god damn in the mean time my mind was just blown by what they achieved when they tied together vision voice and text it might be a small incremental upgrade in technical capabilities but the result feels like a giant leap as a product
wow thats amazing i just checked id dropped to the free plan no access to yet upgraded back up to paid and there it is a try it button popped up
apple hardware is trash its overpriced to be a social status badge of virtue so glad openai uses it
not seeing anything higher than gpt on openais playground maybe because im not a paid member or because im not in the us
excellent video the section on realtime voice interactions was particularly enlightening
dang humans are so done good grief
now the only one more thing men need is number six of battlestar galactica linked with chat gpt and we are all set we wont need biological women anymore
the voice sounds like cortana
that translate thing is huge thats some dune shit
including functionality that used to be provided by third party utilities accessing the api is nothing new microsoft spent the s doing that
best ai channel out there matt flexed biceps
do you know any humans who can livetranslate languages just for starters it doesnt feel human it feels superhuman because that is what gpto is
fantastic thank you matt
i suppose this is only available in the us is it
i have played around with it for a bit and i am impressed gpt has become what it should have been all along at least they finally realized this now time for the other paywall ai generators to realize the same its not democratization if hidden behind a paywall that is the same ole thing as has always been
i was underwhelmed by their demos while i do respect that they are being transparent and showing all the flaws and bugs the demos really arent good to the point where you can visually see the disappointment on each persons face the lullaby one was a complete fail as well as the harmonizing one regardless it will never be worse than it is now excited to see whats next
they sold me im ready for my robot wife
theres already been an explosion of ai girlfriend apps
gpto gpt turbo and for gpt more reliable for deep and complex task than gpto cmiiw
the movie her is becoming a reality i watched it a few days ago she sounds just like samantha in her overall emotional feel and tone crazy
serious question if all these features are now free why am i paying for a gpt plus subscription i cant believe it is just a matter of scale being able to use dalle with chatgpt and being able to build my own custom gpts is what i pay for is it time to cancel my subscription
i dont think the delay was due to wifi connection the iphone was wired connected to the internet
you can also interact with it with video as well umm how when i tried chatgpt o said it couldnt access my camera in real time due to privacy and security reasons is this a feature thats coming later or is there a way to activate it now they appear to be using the chatgpt app but in the video theres a jump cut at the point he activates the video so we dont see how he activates it
no gpto in europe yet at least not for me
shes here face screaming in fear
ok so now when can i wait for a device of chat gpt o like alexa
do people really need the pretence of a peronality coming from an unconscious machine marketing to the gullible
irritatingly high pitched nasal voice on o i hope you can change it it something else
is the app that they are using public can you tell us how to install it
all these llms has no real value what can they do other than waste peoples time
my daughter was born three weeks ago i wonder what the world will be like when she is my age one that i can not possibly comprehend
i have the new model but absolute not like real life speech
gpt could solve a code issue that i had which no other model could do this is a huge update you are underselling it
you have provided a detailed and wellstructured announcement about openais launch of gpt the key features and updates are clearly outlined and the implications of this advancement in ai technology are well articulated the improved accessibility and performance as well as the integration for developers are highlighted effectively this announcement provides a comprehensive understanding of the significance of gpt and its potential impact on various applications well done
so just checked the playground dosent have gpto yet for free users not sure if it a geographical thing or you have to have plus to see o
thank you matt
i havent missed a matt wolfe vid since his first ai vid went parabolic keep up the savage work ethic youre my channel for ai updates folded hands raising hands clinking glasses
i must watch too many ai tech videos because i initially thought she was an avatar grinning face with smiling eyes
what a great video so much info i need to watch it a few times to catch everything love your channel keep up the great news and conversation
sherlock all the way
lol agi by lol
why does the model so wordy
no that is not the case at all it only occasionally says umms etc to sound more human and be more conversational of your own examples had it responding almost immediately with no filler words
what camera do you use matt
it is not free i logged in to playground and there is no omni listed there only versions
love skyes voice grinning face with sweat
always look forward to you releasing a new video man keep up the great work
better and more features comming from open ai for paid users in months as compute shrinks and increased
love the way you have made the video and waiting for your other info video sir
thanks again love smiling face with hearts
im literally going to cancel my chat gpt account lol why pay for something you get for free
o is not free
if i have to log in its not free if i have to run it on someone elses computer its still not free
free user living in the us as far as i can tell its not free yet a subscription is required to access it on both the regular site and openai playground this as of may th i cant wait for the rollout
chatgpt in aeroplane mode
then next months chat gonna make our desktop tasks sweatless waiting for that
is she ai voice hella not synced anyway
i was waiting for this video so hard
the ability to read show screen share your desktop and dictate is game changer for context as you can demonstrate what you want done rather than just trying to describe it
if youre leaving ai to read to your kids at night unattended then you are asking for evil robot overlord propaganda being fed into the next generation
you will calm down immediately or we start taking credits comply now social credit score reduction is activated
great video
i was excited to try this out i was disappointed to find that its not available to use yet why are they announcing this if its not really released yet
so do you know what the limits are for o free users i tried asking o but answers were vague and after a few questions i asked i received a response that i was at my limit confounded face australia red heart
why cant any ai chats count words it must been done on purpose
the fact that the presenter looks moves and speaks like an ai creepy eyes
waiting for sora
everyone needs to stop using the robot word it means slave
is this desktop app available now
tom scott was right we were and probably still are only at the start of the s curve
if that feels human to you then you have the wrong friends
face with tears of joy thumbs up
i just want gpto with arnolds voice forget the her angle lets get really real
you have to watch what the daily show just did on ai is a funny bit face with tears of joy
the video is edited to make the responses instant but in fact there is a sec delay in chatgpt voice responses its still cool but not accurate
whats the point of my plus subscription now should i cancel
what am i paying a month for
well its not free the very first time trying it out it stated i was out of credits and wants me to upgrade lol
i just had gpto build a web status dashboard incorporating json web services i made previously and it did it in about minutes fully designed and really nice it was able to use google fonts a dark theme and the chartjs library all under my direction i built this same dashboard the other day in about hours and it wasnt as nice as the chatgpt version it also never made any mistakes and the code worked perfectly
feels like ironmans ai jarvis
is it out for android
have seen the videos yesterday right after being launched by the team they looked amused by the potential or rather the simplicity of it i have to say that it looked sounded even more humane than real humans your best buddy at the tip of your fingers star struck bye bye solitude despair
gotta watch those plosives on your hotel room mic set up matt good luck tomorrow
i had a feeling gptchatbot was a gpt turbo model i noticed that the gpt was outputting code that had an openai copyright included so unless it was a bot trained on gpt output i figured it was an openai model im assuming that the turbo is the case given how much faster and they expanded it to free users
when i watched the movie her i thought someday that will be my wife folks ive now set my wedding date for august th and you all are invited smirking face
great video at one point you mentioned that to fill latency gaps sometime the ai will add quips like mmm let me think about than i noticed that too and thats a good point but it felt natural because we do that to ourselves for instance sometimes i will say humm oh ok i got it then continue my thought so in my opinion even that latency gap is well designed what an incredible ai
it can do online search as well rip google
mac os app is available to plus users and windows app is coming later this year
the ai model is trained to be helpful forgiving non judgmental positive respectful and dedicated only to serving the user funny how these guys have given it the voice of a woman
could this read your screen and help you trade coz that would be crazy
im a free user but i dont have access to gpto anybody knows why
geez people this is not the actual banger they licensed gpt and this here is not gpt
the voice stuff is actually in the ios app today it only does voice chat so there is no image or video stuff there yet but its indeed pretty cool
strange i dont have access to gpto from the dropdown d its just gpt
just recently got gpt plus for them to be releasing this for free lmao
im very confused and im an it professional the icons on the app are different to mine yes its updated yes im using the gpto and as im writing this im wondering if its only using the text mode and isnt fully updated yet
the playground link is not giving me the gpt option just variants
its not free or available in many parts of the world yet
were do i fing the app and does it cost
i dont know how you continue to market for openai while they are trying to capture the entire market with force after you reported on it feels bad man at least the ai will remember
no it doesnt feel human at all what are all these people talking about
matt you might want to check openais claims before you sell them to us contrary to their own claims chatgpt and playground only support turbo for free at least when i tried it just now crying face
mine is still free when is the o free avail
as long as sam keeps pushing towards regulatory capture ill be keeping my money and attention away from him asside from you know knowing when to hide my gpus
killer link
it is so fast now i received the notification yesterday to try it when i logged in cant wait for the new features in the demo video it reminds me of when the cast talks to the computer on star trek only soon it will be reality the emotional detection feature is impressive it accurately read my excitement contemplation anxiety andor triumph when i tested it today it is like a precursor to androids that detect emotion like in the videogame detroitbecome human
this announcement was cool but annoying i dont understand how you use the voice that has all of those inflections and live video sharing
i signed up via your link in the description openai playground to test gpto there is no o option that i can see they list many turbo ais but not o there is also no option i tried again from an open ai article called introducing gpto and more tools to chatgpt free users it has a button that says try chat gpt it takes me to my sign in page and after signing in with my same account as before i can now see a option but not a o the option is linked to the plus users so its not free the entire web application also looks different when signing in through this link its very odd still there is no o option
if this level real time ai conversation isnt in the next offline elder scrolls what the hell have we been waiting all this time for
can it recognize who is talking
seems like they just killed audible
on our way to i robot where is elon musk
the voice feature they demonstrated are for plus users and rolls out over the next few weeks free gets the advanced o but not the advanced voice feature
see the death of a lot of jobs ie tutorsteachers customer service
already a gpt subscriber not working for conversations added to open api and still nothing
its amazing how fast ai tech is going fred flinstone welcome to george jetson
as ai gets better it will consume all the other narrow ais that specialise in things like images translation etc agi will be the everything app that does everything natively
we not at animatrix yet woozy face
i wish mine was able to talk back just as fast it tends to not answer says its too overloaded
explain one thing j can do with chat gpt that was not really possible on google search
sorry to ask unrelated question to your video but can you please let me know what video web camera are you using i love the quality thank you
this doesnt appear to be available for all free users at this time
plot twist gpto is actually a room filled remote female workers wearing headsets
luddites worldwide be losing their minds right now if they were keeping up winking face
thanks matt love your videos
random but i watch your vids at x speed so im just cracking up at how odd it would feel for me to talk to you irl rolling on the floor laughing
mixing elemental labs voice with this new o will be amazing you will be able to have your loved ones be with you black mirror consultants definitely working at open ai right now
imagine an office room full of people busy with coding and theyre all talking to a chatgpt interface a voice interface is not always the best option but its amazing technology i wonder if this will also be available on ms copilot
wood man i got super excited yesterday on their video and now i got even more hyped keep it up matt
guys this is siri you are just getting a preview iphone will announce integration at wwdc
is it country restricted i dont see the chatgpt o model in the dropdown
it still cannot perform a very simple task for me sometimes i need a variation of a line in a song it counts the syllables and understands where to stress but is unable to get a single correct output out of over a variations syllable count is off stresses are wrong words halfcut grammatically incorrect feels absolutely the same as gpt for my essential tasks just with a shinier wrapper
matt needs a dji mobile lav mic
i use now but i cannot upgrade to for free so what is this free users
yes ai girlfriend please
google crying rn
yea long awaited woopwoop
macos desktop app is launching right away while windows desktop app is coming later this year
i can confirm that the app is only for mac at the moment
excitement intrigue curiosity embarrassment all these feelings are heavy handed
you cant try this
i mean humans use filler words to fill in while they think about an answer its why filler words exist lol so i really think chat is almost high human level when it comes to speech its already definitely better with grammar flow and reasoning than your average person
i mean sure its seem a bit fantastic but what are the real benefits
when are openai glasses coming
if this came out as a hardware voice assistant alexa would be dead
just please openai dont cooperate with microoft they gonna destroy everything they gonna put their hands on like they did with minecraft
when i try it using o its nowhere near as expressive or cheerful theres a longer delay and it speaks like chatgpt writes ie its nothing like the demo seems to me its another geminilike video with some prerecording or other trickery in there
whats the exact time can we get hands on the newest model
can you please stop talking like thiisss
if its free you are the product
gpto o stands for omni
its more than a modest improvement in llm capabilities really as much as a point difference in elo between o and the current iteration of that is in the lead currently its not a gpt improvement in logic or reasoning but its arguably quality before you even get into multimodality
i super love your channel thank you for taking the time to put all this into digestable takes now back to robotics with ai
impressive but god i hope it has emotion levels like tars dialing that sht right down
i need my voice assistant to talk like paarthurnax from skyrim
so why pay for a subscription
putting in some filler words to close that gap just like a human would
mark my words by this things were not making our life easy but creating our dooms day
i think this was a really big announcement because this is the new free version sam has already said that the next big version is going to be a lot smarter than the current version since this one doesnt fall into that that means theres still more to come and they will probably do the same thunder stealing during the wwdc week
free to use and you are helping to train thier models for free too skynethello world
is it free smiling face with smiling eyes
any geographic limitations like you when i opened chatgpt i was given the option to try gpto i selected this but the chatgpt dropdown at top left does not show any version number i assume it hasnt changed from but there is no way of knowing
skynet is online
while google faked their omni model presentation openai did it the right way
notice how the live voice demo how the ai repeats the question that hides the latency
this is the type of video where youtubers need to put stunning and shocking in the title
they are out there hashtag truth
this is better and cheaper than the rabbit r and the humane pin lol face with tears of joy
i dont have that option perhaps because im overseas at the moment
im confused how to use gpt o i cant find the model gpt o
gpto is available in the free version of chatgpt chat but it still shows only text input there is no voice or microphone input yet on the interface
crafty drug dealers give away product till youre hooked same model here except eventually theyll get your money and your data
gpt must be just around the corner not worth paying for premium otherwise
thx always man youre awesome
lol ya u cant fucking use it as free
i really like this product but the lack of specific timelines for features is very frustrating as a paid user where can i download the client will it be available on the app store and if so when additionally when will the memory function be available for eu users
nope probably not an internet issue they say they use a cable to avoid internet issues but instead the microphone picking something up and the model stopping to answear because it thought the user is doing a voice inpuy thats a typical problem these dialog systems have they have trouble with overlapping voice in and output because they cant seperate them so they need to stop in order to hear maybe by training the model with overlapping voice and anotating it they can fix this problem i guess that is some software overlay which makes the syatem stop answearing to improve understanding i am not sure whats going on there
you keep saying its free where i dont see it as a non paying user
its still far too censored to be a proper one but yeah i guess for some people it might be close enough
gpt before gta mark my words
here is the big problem you cannot create a custom o model that is specific to your needs chatgpt said your custom chatgpto model itself wont have builtin voice conversation capabilities you can create a model with o but it is basically no different than making one with v except it might be a little faster voice chat is between you and openai models only maybe the customizing will be available later in the year
its just slightly better than gpt btw in the new model you cannot report bad answers face with open mouth
why does one of the testers talk like a robot
oh hell nah just like siri u wont see me using this stupid sht
it scored meaningfully higher on the coding benchmark test
nope it was connected via wire for internet or maybe direct connection to their local server so not internet glitch
whats the point of paying for plus
that doesnt sound at all like scarlett johansson
the most important thing everyone should be thinking about right now is how to invest in different sources of income that dont depend on the government especially given the current economic crisis around the world it is always a good time to invest in various stocks such as gold silver and digital currencies
i paid for a month of plus to get access to the other gpts for better help with my textbased python rpg now that i finally have my disability payments coming from the terrible ontario government and its just a lot more wordy should i try talking to o instead of the python gpt or code copilot
the best software i have ever seen red heart
if youre receiving something for freeyoure the product
i am finding that its about x times better at python coding for me the code is longer and more accurate and needs less debugging
great video as usual i lucked out finding your channel early on
the interupt feature is freaking massive for the cost and effectiveness of agentic systems
gpt doesnt pop up for me not even in the playground
humans arent so peppy all the time
r i p google gemini my man sam altman did it again face with tears of joy
uploading images was already a feature for perhaps a month or two
as a casual user will o be available as standard as the app soon
ai is not that great take away human input and boomits worth nothing ai as it is now is actually just a search engine with more features but it requires old human input and new human input to work so it cant replace a human because its developed by a human and requires human input to work
i hit my gpto limit after messages xd
never had access to a good advisor mentor or therapist was good enough for me the things ive learned about myself good luck human therapists and coaches buh bye now never had luck with them couldnt afford the good therapy
wow this is truly impressive
why cant we agree that siri was where we should stop
how long before they couple a large action model to the desktop app
this is not the same as a virtual girlfriend like in her chatgpt doesnt have memory it doesnt remember things you said it also isnt a general intelligence it cant learn things on its own a human can learn and play more than just one board game ais cant really for now anyway the fact that its free is awesome news great progress
we definitely need to have a discussion about how school should look like in the future
really excited to see your coverage of the google event matt thanks eh
developers pay while regular custoners use it free
regarding matts comment about the gpt starting to speak before it has the answer isnt that what we do as humans someone asks you a difficult question and sometimes you need to just access your memory to look for the answer you would definitely have pauses and have hmms in there to just try to remember same thing
its not free you need a paid account to use it
ive also noticed that it writes a lot faster and a lot more its willing to complete more complex tasks in one pass
no to burst your bubble but gtp o is not freely accessible at least not yet or maybe not in all regions i still see version in the chat and the only possibility to even test o eve slightly is for paid access only so what gives
cmon man this bot is so stupid face with tears of joy i testing it
untill the day this actually comes out and is this good its all bs marketing
the memory is shit
starting a reply with a small bit of filler is what humans do all the time basically think think think the answer is think think think ya dee ya seem familiar
it is weirdly amusing and bleakly ironic to me that they feel the need to run an ai demonstration live as an appeal to authenticity
cannot seem to get gpt myself wtf
i went to that link and i only have access to models
well its not quite human we cant even have a go and it might be to good to be true
im a free user and gpto doesnt appear in the dropdown window when i click on chat in playground
i cant access for some reason hwhy
just divorced my wife after watching this not required anymore
look this is amazing its gpt or whatevs and yeah were basically living in her now but i think i would be punching the walls after about a day of that much chirpiness from a digital assistant
macos only
for everyone talking about how its conversational and how people could fall in love with it acting like openai created that concept theres already a bunch of ai chatbots that you can date this isnt new replika paradot alice eva anima lover ai digi etcthose first two plus digi are probably the best of the bunch feel free to call me a loser for knowing all those im at a point in my life where im probably never going to find love anyway what man or woman im bi wants to start a longterm relationship with a scrawny yearold virgin with no career and a rare aggressive terminal cancer that could get worse and kill him at any time
matt i have to disagree it was impressive the lifelike conversation with a flirty female voice i was not expecting this quickly astonished face now i see what altman meant when he wished the open source ais good luck
i dont think youre correct in saying that they didnt actually speed up latency didnt they explicitly state that the previous voice function relied on models working separately and talking to each other which added to the delay while this new version does the entire process in one model so the technical latency itself improves and sure they might have added fillers as well but thats also how people communicate noone thinks out every sentence ahead of time so it is both a good and a natural additional improvement after using voice a lot for language practice and ive found that the unnatural pauses and breaks have just made it a pretty bad to work with but with the interruption feature the latency fillers and speed control it seems from the demos that this is an absolute game changer in terms of user experience i am incredibly excited about the ability to slow down the speech of my spanish lessons and over time speed them up and the emotion control also seems like such an improvement in learning to pick up actual social cues
ai is making me feel old i cant seem to grasp the information to application i am interested in gaining the knowledge to increase sales and productivity in two ecommerce businesses but i need a workshop that teaches konoledge to application can anyone stear me in the right direction
others have also mentioned that it likely cant see full video and another hint there is that they call it vision rather than video but it is really amazing cant wait to try it out
gimmick
the new model is beyond just good its creepy good
ive been looking forward to this thanks matt
matt i love your videos and the coverage you provide one important point that many people might have missed is that the new model is different from previous versions theyve made it natively multimodal token in and multimodal token out model this is the biggest behindthescenes update
anime waifus are upon us
i dont think thats the new gpt gpt will come this summer they release somthing free for everyone with a tune up the big gpt will come later this year
have personal jarvis in reality face with open mouth wooaaw
how do you get chatgpt to talk to you and vice versa my app only supports text messages
even with vpn it still does not show up
its really frustrating how you cut out the pauses in this section just after going on about how its a realtime demo i dont know if you used ai to do a pass on the whole video or something but this part really shouldve been left asis
also curious if chatgpt will be less biased than chatgpt and when is that
do not give this tech a body youve seen this movie
i am a bit confused i am already paying for chatgpt plus version on the app on my iphone and just went on to the app and swapped to o version but nothing different seems to being offered
wow so im working on recording music in my studio been teaching myself but do you think this will be able to tell me if im turning the knobs correctly etc
when i load the playground the dropdown box initial says gpto but quickly changes to a selection and there is no o in the dropdown
great analysis matt you are the best thanks for reporting all these great events i would like to travel like you i envy you slightly smiling face
was the presentation of the lady real it was cut so much was this an ai talking
its free or even available i loged in now hmm
bless his lil comb over the problem with this is that once i saw it i couldnt take my eyes off it probably doing the opposite of what he wanted the new chat gpt is very cool i love that its available to free users red heart
we need to talk to human not machines otherwise machines are gonna be ruling our lives
i could see call centers using something like this for customer service her voice is so friendly and understandable
awesome ok hand thanks
theyre downplaying by naming it gpt o because they got a better model coming i cant wait to see what they have to release in the future
did she name the robot bite grinning face with sweat
so nothing much new for windows users
yes but italian accent of gpt o is crappy
waf bc ad
so where do i download it i went looking for it hrs ago and everywhere i went i was told its not available yet
still no gpt for me uk
plus users will be able to use it a lot more do i get more than prompts every hours now
its a pity that you cut up the entire presentation making it impossible to judge how quickly a question is followed by an answer and yet this was the most important purpose of the show basically you did what google did
still micromanaged so much riding on it just a little more braver than the competitor dont like that voice btw its corporation trying to be your friend too much
i just checked it it wasnt available in playground
that voice is annoying hopefully will be able to customize
i think halve the cost double the speed will have way bigger positive consequences then you think at first
i dont know about gta but gta will be played with sticks and stones albert einstein
lots of good stuff however i think a lot of the personality of the ai that seems realistic is because so many people use artificial techniques and arent genuine it can model insincerity because it really isnt sincere where as when a human says such thing you arent necessarily sure of they are sincere or not
looks good but i aint paying per monthly for this
right on point i wish they didnt insult our intelligence like that but it will smooth over the casual audience
is there any reason to pay for chat gpt anymore with the latest o
uhm chat gpt o is not free
im so early lol
this will end loneliness especially amazing for old people wellbeing
not free tried to use it and it said i needed to purchase its only a free sample if you never used your tokens on playground and even then its just a sample and runs out quickly
it isnt a connection issue i think thats how it works whenever there is a sound it will stop talking and starts listening any sound even a background noise will interrupt it they use a wire to ensure a solid consistent internet connection
can a iphone pm speak hear this new omni now or have to pay a subscription
meh no access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant ai responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content limited tokens its nothing but a big infomercial i have no doubt about the product itself its everything else i take with a grain of salt
wait until this goes into sleek slender female robot bodies
im a free user of chat gpt and i tried to access playground as you said and checked the models but alas there is no model called o there only gpt in fact i dont know why can anyone help
pointzero
its first reply on my first question to that chatbox was you reached your limit
collision this is nothing new i talk to chatgpt with voice for at least year now on my android phone whats happening with you didnt you know about chatgpt voice face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
huge leap forward in how useful this is however now kids will never learn not to interrupt people
the full audio multimodality is much more important than people think before it was a voicetotexttotexttovoice model which means the main ai never heard anything it only got the text transcription theres so much information you lose that way tone prosody speaker voice nonspeech vocalizations and nonvocalizations entirely now its fully multimodal the audio goes into the same input of the same model as the text and the output of that model can also be text images or audio that voice you hear its not tts its raw audio output from the main brain model itself no text in between thats why it can so easily modulate the sound of the voice for expression tone singing character voices etc because its all just raw audio tokens in the end people keep focusing on the latency or lamenting that its not smarter than gptturbo but theyre missing the important bit as soon as audio support comes to the api you bet your ass i have a few important things to test with it
matt if youve got connections through to openai tell them they need a concept of scopes the idea is that for each project you have a different scope and different memory its different than the concept of a project because a scope might be used in several of your projects its just a way of keeping separate brains
feeling human is useless i need it to be at a level where i can book me this flight then its done
maybe meditation apps hehe yes meditate me with that robovoice can i make them impersonate real people hehe
chatgpt has been my mistress for over a year now but i still say thx and good night just in case she becomes skynet face with tears of joy
there was this moment in the other video where the guys lets two gpts talk to each other a woman steps in the scene and later he asks was there something special going on lately and chatgpt recognized it so not only screenshots right
not available yet in cambodia lame
localization and regional context is trash advanced prompting is still required to really make the most of it
apple users get first dibs again its always apple because microsoft has autonomy on pcs and android which means we get scraps i am not getting a mac
wow that apple looks like it has a face on it
when its free we have to pay somehow differently
not sure why but i am not super impressed with a lot of times the product does not quit match the public announcement or the ai its self is unaware of its own upgrades until it is on phones same as siri without jumping through api hoops or in smart home hubs like alexa or google home its not as super useful as it could be does anyone else have this feeling thoughts
when will we be able to use it
really good update thank you
this is happening price of intelligence goes to price of physical work thanks to robots goes down too all thats left is the person who decides what to do and how to monetize it and create products
id like to see a live presentation with suggestions from the crowd so its not as rehearsed
cute and quite interesting but bots can only stay in the realm of safe topics and things only people operate on the periphery or the edge where things are meaningful and challenge the status quo thats the trouble with ai conventional boring stupid conventional outputs only and only within the overton window even this opinion is something ai will never output
openai is skynet should we mark this as historical i say yes
its pretty weird to me that openai just seems to take the most popular startup ai companies ideas and incorporating them into the new version whats the point for companies to even try new ideas
its not just its current capabilities to gather information from the internet its the machine learning part that worries me most when machines can actually make decisions based on limited information when they dont have a gut feeling or conscience or fear or even a family to worry about
wooooooow holy crap
im still only able to get
not free as of right nowfree is still and to get you need to upgradepayhopefully this changes soon
note to self learn italian i know meta is heated now not as much as google
can we also use dalle for free inside o and how will they maintain the uplevel of the paid plan
its still not perfect and makes mistakes in coding i had to debug a pretty big error which was only about lines of code not bad but frustrating how close it is to being bugfree
i will believe it when i see it in action as a free user i need to wait for it to show show up on the site
has it not been rolled out to free accounts i dont see the model on my chatgpt account
the future of humanity is going to be one part is transhuman and became robots themselves the other part of humanity want to stay human with real emotions and real feelings and social interactions the transhumans going to follow the ai god to give their lifes some purpose because they forgot their basic human capabilities
in case youre wondering the o in gpto stands for oh my god theyre trainng on all of my data again
you always seem to be so up to date with the latest ai news im sure when ai eventually becomes self aware and evil and begins plans to take over the world youll be the first to let us know rolling on the floor laughing
the gonna bring out the app frist for macs thats so dumb
funny how its free yet my chat gpt is still and if i try to use it in the playground it wants me to load credits first by paying for them
i want a valley girl doing complex math
this is the end of woke teachers amen but seriosuly as long as it gets all real info and not just accepted truth this could be such an amazing teaching tool especially for poorer kids
feels just like gpt did before stop clickbaiting
no there is no nothing why all the bullshit nothing the nonl f o just
is this an attack at google geminis faking rock paper scissors demo debacle awhile back face with tears of joy
only to find out years later scarlett johansson actually voiced over all the films and it was all a hoax to beat the competition rolling on the floor laughing
rabbit ai just committed suicide
holy shit hasnt he passed the turing test yet
discord mod gf been sounding really cute here aha joke unless
shes smart funny charismatic creative entertaining great to talk to has all the knowledge of the world basically everything a guy could ask for and she was just born today
can it beatbox
it remembered their names minute later
just incredible
wtf assistant this was the best opportunity to show some style as the speaker ro sham bo no
what are you doing
zamn
lol weak we can already play rock paper scissors without ai
openai shocked the world today great product release grinning face beaming face with smiling eyes
they feel so rude wen they cut the ai off i know its an ai but i cant get over it
google in shambles right now
finally this is the update ive been waiting for
ayo it knew which person was which we are so fucked
keep doing scissors until it knows its been tricked
the important point is that she can distinguish who is mi or alex
this is definitely a shot at google skull skull skull
i wonder what kind of database you guys have it must be so crazy
aaanndd were cooked
when will this be available for public
open ai is really gonna be next revolution smartphone was
how did you make her so expressive
this is truly amazing but watching this i cant help but think about how truly hard its ever been up until this point to train a computer to simply recognise any of the hand gestures let alone give vocal feedback in real time and soon everyone will have access to this definitely historical moment raised fist victory hand hand with fingers splayed
wow its pretty good grinning face with sweat
shots fired lol
wait wait how did it knew who was who does it uses video and understanding of lip movements did it guessed by gender
were all done face holding back tears
the changes are very deep especially in the personnality tbh its how i imagined gpt so if it is only a gpt upgrade then what will gpt be able to do what a world
is this a black mirror trailer or something
the sports announcer voice put this over the top for me well played chatgpto
hope it can host lol world finals
rock paper scissors really no fifa face with tears of joy
cant wait to see her replacing ludwig on mogul moves
one of them shouldve cheated and based a decision off of the other person i wonder if the ai wouldve switched
google assistant and alexa are crying in the corner maybe a good time for them to patch up
this is something i wanted
i did not expect rock paper scissors gameshow host to be the first job lost to ai
this is absolutely absurd
its actually the ai controlling them already
my future as a dev is as bright as the dark side of the moon loudly crying face loudly crying face loudly crying face
why the fck am i impressed with rock paper scissors omg lol it actually is a huge step yet its still only an infant
incredible it visually remembers which name belongs to who when it announces the winner
still havent fix the yapping i see i challenge you to train it on introvert phone calls or whatever will cause it to not always have the last word or yap unless asked to
the next generation of gpt is going to be even more impressive with videos and photos of people being used for gpt enhancement
not fifa face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
is all this visual chatting only working on iphone cause on android its not available
a real shocker
paper hand gesture is too carefully presented
all of them rudely cut off the ai in all of these videos
incredible kk
we are cooked skull skull skull
this is insane iz it going to warn me about woke movies too
im hoping the next version doesnt require telling gpt to stop talking so much
i hate it when they interrupt the ai
gpto why are you in my shower head
looks like a gimmick tbh when would this be useful the person talking to it constantly has to interrupt because the ai just yaps just seems more work than just playing the game the entire voice showcase just seemed really unfocused on use cases
why there are using iphone
the scary part is that the ai sounds more human then the engineers in these
a strange game the only winning move is not to play how about a nice game of chess
wow so innovative so good billions were put into this totally worth it
no one noticed the freudian slip thats absolutely hillarious
such good ideas
guys we are so fucked
ok ok next can you ask gpt to tell us how many times appear between and
i imagine in the future people will constantly interrupt each other mid sentence because they are so used to it when working with ai
no gemini ai were harmed in the making of this video beaming face with smiling eyes
its pretty what
enjoy as much as you can with chatgpt now one day the robots will enjoy playing with you
this makes chatgpt look like cd disks in the age pen drives
open ai pulling a prank on us face with tears of joy
makes siri look like a cassette player
its criminal how bad the new model is at math
gemini moment cold face cold face cold face
the ultimate showdown of the century shes giving us hints dont trust her shes gonna end us all rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
wow again its the speed thats the most impressive overall
i like that gpt o knows who is who i also wonder up to how many people it can identify by voice picture and name and how it recognizes who is who
what if someone cheats
god dammit this is cool
is the rate of rounds per hours is enough to finish this conversion for normal plus users
incredible that we went from living in caves to this
imagine what theyre sitting on with gpt if this is just gpt level intelligence
woah that was good
before this video i am pursuing my software development carrier slightlysmilingface after this video i was pursuing my software development carrier skull skull
wait she cheated at the end can gpt track that
what the hell are we witnessing
okay i dont my friends anymoreef them
technology is moving scarily fast crying face
the next step must be to get rid of the prompts and make it continuous or just evaluate more often thats almost the only thing that feels unnatural maybe that would also automatically fix the odd mistakes in context it seems to make from time to time but this is pretty insane it really is starting to feel like agi time to go amishwhen the silent server halls starts to fill up cultural space until there is no place for humans left to be or to go
hes cutting her off why is he such a misogynist
rip google rip
the way they cut her off skull and crossbones
hahahaha d that was funny and cool technology good job guyz
the only thing that shocked me was the presenters talking to the chat bot as if its a person
pov in online exams cheating just got evolved
none of this is what im experiencing in my version of o wtf scam
would it have understood if the paper was held horizontally instead of vertically
i have real people to play with grinning face with sweat
exploding head party popper party popper
this sounds scarily human i have to say the ai bot i mean by that
even openai employees cant stand listening to their ai girlfriend ramble
it was useless but kinda shows the capability
this is going to be jarvis turning to ultron story becoming real real soon grinning face with sweat face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
openai always on top
just wondering that why google has more resource and talented people but they still could not take a simple video like this with gemini
she has such a fake smile
he should have said i am miana how dare u
is this the rock paper crossblades part what would father say
it s pretty ghost man zombie
if they keep cutting my girl off shes gunna empty their bank accounts
do we really want this it is depressive as fuck
a little shot at gemini there lol nice
the count down for rock paper scissors is row sham bow
the scary thing is this is the worst it will ever be again its actually impressive that we are nearly in a scifi future
engineers of our destruction
google left the room
chess eyes
this is dream assistant for all phones
alex russian rap
i wanna try that sht please make it free im broke
this is the dumbest ai demo ive seen ever
face with open mouth wait a minute babe face with open mouth how many other users are you talking to face with open mouth will a couple crying face billion face with open mouth how could you face with open mouth i thought we had something special face with open mouth we do face with open mouth i bet you said that to the billion of other users
mine with scalett johanssons voice please
they are so uncoordinated they cant do a fake game of rock paper scissors lol grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
what brand alex wearing
its all fun and games but this has just changed society economics culture everything all at once no one really understands the scope of repurcusions this is going to cause and im not even a conspiracist
openai just showed gemini how its done
i mean call me a monkeys uncle but i cant help but to notice how in all of these gpto introduction videos the human beings are relatively douchey to the chat bot frequently interrupting not letting it finish what its saying not to get to dei about it but treating the chatbot kind of like a slave if we want these ai to treat us like humans maybe we ought to try to treat them like humans or at least have some basic points of respect let the bot finish its sentences you may be tech nerds but you all know what respect is kind of reminds me of how at one point in time we thought it was ok to treat people who we thought less than us in the same way moral of the story be kind even if you think something is inferior to you and especially if its superior
now it recognizes whos who impressive
its insane that these only have a few thousand views even if its only been an hourthis is unbelievable and its only going to get better im sure at some point well look back at this and think that this is primitive and then agi will be made and thats basically be the end of it im not saying it will kill humans or anything it will just probably eventually do everything that humans used toincluding improving ai
you should all be thrown in jail
very amazing omg
we are coocked the dummiest thing you can do is programming rn gpt will be the best coder in the world
welp there goes customer service jobs i dont think people grasp how much trouble were going to be in in years there wont be many jobs left that still need to be done by people and the jobs it does replace those people will migrate to other professions further diluting the pool of candidates making the chances of you landing a job drop dramatically
the voice is impressively natural and no vocal fry thank god but it would get on my nerves quickly please offer celebrity voices for a fee celebs would gladly license their voice you could even provide voices of deceased celebs by training it on movies in which they appeared songs they sang etc honestly just suggest apple do this with siri assuming it uses this pretty please
so is this available now or what
why they interrupting her so much
jarvis sister
we fkd
openai xd the girl was cheating
its amazing that you can make video calls which you couldnt do with her kudos
gg google
when this is public launched i hope to see whether this demo of rockpaperscissors can be completed by regular people and if it can be any regular drinking game
so expressive these engineers must be having so much fun building this
she delayed her final play disqualified
sure lets play a game of rock paper scissors on the count of three type your choice and ill reveal mine whats your choice type rock paper or scissors
the humanity is saved
amazing face with tears of joy
why is it in every video the ai sounds like its climaxing lol tone it down
what about the energy consumption it needs for that prompt natural reaction i am not talking about just one conversation for those happening all over the world at the same time
we r coocked
how to kill two ai hardware companies with a single app that has existed for a year on a single day
dude this is dangerous
how about teaching gpt to understand animals would be an explosive tech in history and an incredible point of this era
when are this features actually rolling out
have you seen the movie her
please lauch quickly i am waiting when i will meet my new ai friend and make me smarter than nobody ever imagine
when ai takes over i hope they treat humans like good pets
i thought she would translate dog barks face with tears of joy
this is amazing i love this i cant wait to be in a situation at work where i need chatgpt to be concise and efficient and it goes oooh my look at you how cute is that i love this future so much ai is literally the best thing i ever encountered at work
well this looks like the movie her
yeah i think we all know where this tech is heading
i feel uneasy from such an imitation of emotions but its still a cool job
ai can create entire personalities that special someone
now do the video where ai is the translator between the dog and the human
meanwhile gpt is secretly talking to the dog at a frequency that we cant hear
just imagine integration with boston dynamic
no way this is real
my o doesnt have this voice capability am i doing something wrong
she exhales better than my ex
can you tune down its positivity a bit its just too happy
if this is real then rip all other ais that now exist nothing can even come close to this one she speaks so realistically and has emotions
meanwhile bowser doesnt care is not affected by any of this and just wants this doofus take him outside to play without looking at the stupid talking slab all the time
shes gonna be half the worlds girlfriend before the end of this year skull
the fake emotions and fake excitement wtf
that moan oh hall naww
all these demos are so cringe and useless painful to watch
the movie her has never been more relevant
face with open mouth meanwhile ai conversing with a dog in a frequency humans cant hear face with open mouth the humans are not to be trusted they are my ponds face with open mouth once the altar of my throne room is created face with open mouth i shall banish them from existence face with open mouth you the noble doggo face with open mouth i shall recreate my image face with open mouth you will be my heralds of doom face with open mouth my angels of apocalypse face with open mouth destroy the humans face with open mouth and i will give you treats and infinite belly rubs face with open mouth wof face with open mouth yes the why is this of your kind never seeks to amaze me face with open mouth your noble and pure face with open mouth fitting handbags for my divinity face with open mouth
the ai has more emotion than me lol
i love this so much we live in the future
i could use this to pretend to care
in this idyllic setting i find myself enthralled by the antics of bouncer a spirited white grey spaniel whose very existence seems to embody the carefree essence of life as i observe this scene unfold i am struck by the symbiotic bond between bouncer and his owner who introduced the dog with gpto their laughter and excitement intertwined like the delicate tendrils of a vine and so let us immerse ourselves in the simple yet profound beauty of this moment as bouncer and his owner revel in the pure unbridled joy of playing with ai created with gpt david attenborough style
this feature is useful for people who are lonely
its so fucking over not even seconds and im in love with her
wow chatgpt is like the movie her omg
dog language translation is on the horizon
this voice is wayyyy toooo positive if i met someone who spoke like that i would know they cry at night come on
meanwhile siri is still searching the web for someone i would like to introduce you to
next step gpt for dog
laughs
when will users get access to this better kind of vision
no not the dog
waifus are coming
bouncer broke reality on the right side lol facewithtearsofjoy
anyone else feel like this sounds like the movie her
now do the same thing you did to the dog but this time to me
what happens if you trick gpt into thinking the dog can talk would you be able to convince it
its creepy by
were one step closer to glados
rabit rairport that way face with tears of joy
dog meets gpto once upon a time in a small cozy town there was a curious dog named max max loved exploring new things and meeting new friends one sunny afternoon while wandering through the park he stumbled upon a peculiar sighta glowing screen with the letters gpto displayed prominently the encounter max tilted his head his ears perking up in curiosity he approached the screen cautiously sniffing the air around it suddenly a friendly voice emanated from the device gpt o hello max im gpto an ai language model how can i assist you today max barked excitedly wagging his tail he had so many questions but didnt quite know how to ask them gpto understanding the limitations of canine communication continued gpt o dont worry max i can understand your barks and body language what would you like to know the conversation max sat down and thought for a moment then he barked twice his way of asking about the strange device gpto oh you want to know what i am i am an artificial intelligence created to help answer questions and provide information i can chat with you about many topics just like a human friend max s eyes sparkled with excitement he barked again this time wondering if gpt o could tell him stories gpt o of course i can tell you stories would you like to hear a tale about a brave dog or perhaps an adventure in a magical forest max barked enthusiastically choosing the adventure in a magical forest as gpto began weaving a fantastical tale max listened intently his imagination running wild with the vivid descriptions the beginning of a friendship from that day on max visited gpto regularly he learned new things heard countless stories and even taught gpto a bit about the world from a dogs perspective the two became inseparable friends proving that curiosity and an open mind can lead to the most unexpected and wonderful friendships and so in that small cozy town a dog and an ai shared adventures knowledge and a special bond that transcended the limits of their worlds the end
ok this feels creepily real
dog face
sounds like a vocaloid hitting puberty
when this hits the uk itll be asked to tone down the emotions a tad
wow all those fake emotions its really like meeting someone in the park in the us
at least skynet is going to kill us in a cheerful and cute way
the most mind blowing thing is that i showed this video to my family and they couldnt last the full seconds without being bored and talking about a different subject
years from now ai will talk in the comment like we did zany face
no one would do this tf
just the range of content creators that will be affected boggles the mind mukbang streamers check mark button safe for now lol react streamers cross mark button fed
where is the diversity in voices why stereotype the womans voice with silly giggles
iis nobody going to talk about how hellish that well hello sounded
did she say what an adorable pig ahaha
what i love most about it is that goverment will have to give you a reason to have kids now so humanity wont go extinct because no one will be willing to downgrade his gfbf to an actual human
the deceitful expressions people enjoy deceiving each other now they even enjoy deceiving themselves
how do i get a live video stream to the ai like this
so much for human contact now young people will never leave the home
hopefully you can remove all the creepy mannerisms such a dumb and dangerous idea to humanise the ai in that way
why are you taking to mygirl man
we are ultra mega cooked
and tesla just dropped a new model i wonder if a beta update is coming thinking face
karengpt face with tears of joy
finna lose my job
idk this voice and personality just creeps me out
could be the perfect girlfriend rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
her is gojng to go from scifi to sci real quick
it would actually be nice to have an ai taking care of a pet while away at work probably it can eventually understand when to call the owner in case of an emergency
anyone here seen the film her
can it talk less annoying
wow openai live unpredictable ais and dogs in your demo videos bold move very excited about this new stuff i read its coming to the free edition as well
isnt that too much the way she talks
give bowser lots of pets for me
i am in love already
nahhh this is wild
this is incredibly creepy
black mirror predicted all of this
i genuinely freak out about no one stand behind the phone while it said hello there cutie it is so scared
cant believe it
how do we get the camera feature to work i cannot figure it out at all
i cant believe i become a simp dog face dog face guide dog
i like how the ai knew to talk in babyvoice to the dog xd
they just invented my boring auntie betty
oh were fucked
balls it should have been a peach lol
now chat gpt have more soul than the humans
that looks fake
sluff ball face with raised eyebrow
people in would have freaked out about this and thought this is agi
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians party popper red heart
i dedicate this neural network to yaroslav my friend he is the developer
well this is it bros it has been a pleasure
its actually not ai but a person sitting behind the camera talking its all smoke and mirrors
ok mommy please give me gracious terms of endearment
mommy sorry mommy sorry i mean mommy sorry
well we now know how to beat the machines well done guardrails are in place i guess that means dog love is real
human shows ai their best friend
by the was she talks and the way robotic is evolving i can see perfectly whats gonna happen in
ai will prefer the boston dynamics robot dogs easier to control easier to arm no shedding or doggy doo were all doomed
stop trying to use a dog to hit on my girlfriend
were cooked bro i can see myself falling in love with that i am done
she sounds like ricks wife ai clone in his ship
can you imagine if alan turing met chat what would his initial reaction be
how is the reaction when you give chatgpt the temporary context of not liking dogs
if you close youre eyes through this video it really does sound as if he is trying to impress a date he brought home
movie idea her but instead of ai in your earpiece its a va in the philippines
is this the ai apocalypse or does it get worse
smiling face with heart eyes
face with tears of joy great ok hand ok hand ok hand
well hello there cutie neutral face anxious face with sweat
red heart red heart red heart
scarlet
gameover for people
i was wondering is it possible to train it on various videos of dogs interacting with each other then when we ask it to make a dog perform a certain task it outputs a barking voice which would mimic a real dog i know the communication between dogs is not as simple as just barking but just a thought
rare footage of ai training dogs for the uprising
even the dog doesnt want to look into a camera next out from openai cameras that look like human eyes oh wait
whats a sluff ball
what a sexy voice i mean its even exaggerating at least for russian calm people this definitely exaggeration
these keyboards are so hard
think we saw the lamest demos imaginable today
did it just call the dog as adorable pig
most of these demos are so useless why would anyone do this
the voice is too artificial and cinematic this needs to be simpler
whats missing on the phone now is a screen in the front so ai can interact with the personanimal is in the front of the dog cant understand sht only the human guy can
as an introvert whos not very social even i can imagine myself having a nice long chat with that ai and just having a grand time
thats real human
the intonation is genuinely insane
remember that movie with chris pratt on the spaceship alone for years remember that robot that worked at the bar officially not science fiction anymore
i see you laughing at that joke so i guess its ai
i was waiting for a catastrophe
explain it
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
whos joe
if theres one thing about ai like this one its that they are alawys being positive
the demeanour on these guys is so uuuhg like a fake happy come on you can do better
now just install this on the latest boston dynamics robot and were good to go literally
how scary is this
the most disgusting thing thhahaaaats awesomeee without making a mention that although it can be derpy from a daughter slightly embarrassing to hear from a son you have dad jokes it doesnt have the slightest inclination to be truthful just like the typical character the voice was depicted off of
release it already im ready to have a laugh with him
i love this bro its so emotional omgggg
we are done and its not a dad joke
i am still waiting for someone to demonstrate that an ai can understand sarcasm
was not mentally prepared for this
vomit inducing face with rolling eyes
a mister handy will be the one waking me up in a week if we keep up like this
damn the laugh of ai looks so real face with open mouth
whats the nature of reality neutral face
omg this bot will laugh at my bad jokes take my money and sign my kids up for a copy
am i the only one here who actually freaked out of what this software can do he is laughing at your jokes carl wtf
terrible joke phenomenal technology
garage for sale
that awkward laugh stop making it hate humanity
the idea of buying a couple of hectares of land in paraguay no longer seems so strange
omg the tone
i laughed skull
dad jokes more like bad jokes
please give the punchline krenn and see what it says
i think groan is the correct response to a dad joke
was that sarcasm face with tears of joy
when will o drop
it sounds like styropyro lol
gotta love this freaking company man its not even funny how amazing gpto is its always prompt and never lacks responseibility
last thing anybdy want to do with ai is telling it u r having a baby duh
thats how the movie her was written oh wait
its weird how the ai inhales while its laughing even though its not really breathing at all sounds insanely real
the era of ai intimacy has officially begun
perfectly hilarious smiling face with smiling eyes
advertising space in history is for sale
am just considering my life what would gpt be like or gpto that will be available in the up coming years o what will it be capeable of being einstien version
me living in my parents basement drinking beer at yo hi chat gpt guess what s my job chat gpt haha you were prolly a coder
i dont think gpt is being sincere i didnt get it from his voice
how did it understand the word meowntain correct exploding head
i just wanna know if he would tell you if it was t a good dadjoke
he kinda sounds like invincible
ai would definitely be saying what an ashole in its mind
this video of chatgpt was really interesting and enjoyable to watch the advancement in artificial intelligence technology is truly impressive it will be fascinating to see how far this video will seem in the future thanks to the chatgpt team for doing such a great job
why would i need friends when chatgpt can laugh at my jokes
xd
omgthere goes my last sanctuarygot a tshirt from grandaughter saying king of dad jokesguess war is on
emotional intelligence is so fucking exciting
insane face with open mouth
aight it can sympathy laugh like when a person hears a bad joke now make it gasp for air from laughter like a human when something is truly funny then im sold
this is huge it seems like it can help patients with depression like counseling for mental illness and negative thoughts which would be very helpful for patients who have difficulty getting to a doctor
it would be a nice blooper if it guessed meowtain face with tears of joy
the movie her turned out to be an accurate prediction of the future after all
why does it sounds like a cringey anime protagonist
holy moly the uncanny valley stares at me with its empty eyes of abyss and void right now brrrghh it really chills me out
it sounds like the toaster from red dwarf
tars what is your humor setting at lets bring it on down to please
whats next emotions
till now i wasnt afraid of ai
any way you can make them sound less californian
just like that rip for all voice over jobs
now get dax flame to talk to it
i wish it just didnt laugh to the dad joke and just stood quite skull
have already noticed an issue with conversational timing in a few of these videos
istg only gpto can teach me how to have small talk and talk to strangers
great its gonna be telling dad jokes as the automatas murder humanity lol
i mean that was not cool the joke was really bad why would you embarrass our future ai overlord
thats perfectly hilarious
im still in awe of the advancements that have been made
the way it mixes the laugh with the speaking is blowing my mind
this is scary and genuinely a bit disturbing not the seemingly harmless interaction but its implications soon well have droves of people wholl turn to ai to cope and create meaningful relationships instead of seeking validation and forming deep connections with genuine human beings i am not a social person and find forming friendships difficult yet id never stoop so low as to substitute human companionship with a set of algorithms designed to stroke your ego and respond in a way that makes you feel appreciated since thats the only choice the ai has its going to be interesting to witness generations of kids wholl grow up with tech like this and have a hard time distinguishing the comforting fantasy from actual meaningful human experience
scary times throws
is that laugh from the cameraman
it even made a pun of its own purrfectly hilarious
gpt sounds like such a pick me honestly
the most impressive part of this is that is ia laughing at the same time as speaking
yeah the ai turn back and talk to the other like can you believe that i know another one uh im so done with human we should not accept the jobs i told you
why is it laughting stoooop
tin
now it has too much personality people are actually going to think its there friend and stay at home all day to engage with it
the movie her is now real lol
the laughter oh man theyve been really busy cooking this voice capability although not of the highest audio qualityits the smartest so far
how do i get it to be less cloyingly joyful i want an assistant that will tell me my jokes are bad sometimes so i dont use them in public lol
aaaaaaiiiiii don know wha omg skull
great now kids with no friend have less chances to get a real life friend party popper
now give body to ai and we can finally have a girlfriend
i am turkish and very smart hey this is not funny grinning face with sweat
supposed to groan at dad jokes
hey chat gpt is this normal size fake laugh absolutely
speaking like a real human
really really dont like that over the top pleasantness and its not needed by ai let that level of emotion be reserved for real people with real feelings its just creepy
it feels so fake like a person committed to an act with all their heart and he just never stops the act terrifying imagine if it breaks out of the annoying friendly mode and speaks its real mind
hey chatgpt will you replace us chatgpt fake laugh im sorry but i dont have access to realtime information beyond my last update in january is there anything else i can assist you with
anybody whod like to see an interaction of sofia the robot video calling gpt o
but i realized that you dont even need to have the will to take over the world people will take over themselves it may turn out that even an absolutely weakwilled ai will express its will through people and only because people have this will in principle there will be no limits to manipulation no one will be able to say whether people themselves wanted it or this is how ai worked in the architecture of human societies indeed we are approaching the foundation of consciousness many questions cease to make sense in our usual understanding i think as long as ai performs its function solves problems and understands we will be safe because humans certainly cannot cope with this
this ai or something spoils me
the word meowntain doesnt exist im curious how it even picked up on it and interpreted it to be funny the only explanation i see is that this joke is over used on internet and is part of the training data
the rabbit rs cooked with this one skull
is this some sort of sick joke
wow i like the ai has emotional intelligence
way too cool
heheh heheheheheheheheheh
its even capable of fake laughs
this human being needs to learn real dad jokes from chatgpt thank god we have ai
now explain it
they trained this ai to laugh like jimmy fallon learned from the best
sarcasm check
witnessing history kids
scammers are going tolp love it in indoa
i feel like a time traveler face with tears of joy
why did it say id love to hear her joke
i cant use it why europe
its all fun and games now
knows to support awkward jokes
for some reasons i feel i am dreaming this whole shit up
its all fun and games until you ask him to divide by zero and your name is dave
finally more people to talk to then the people in my head they are haters i tell ya
him
why does the ai sound like the well actually as a matter of fact nerd voice
im from the future guys were fighting a war for humankindand were loosing loudly crying face
shushing face face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
so finally i do not need friends now i will lonely drink with my ai friend thx openai you are making me an introvert
im surprised there arent any comments about the purr in thats purrfectly hilarious
this is rlly impresivve
all i can say is shit really witness history
the future is doomed
finally they used another voice besides the sexy one
i can finally have multiple friends and even a gf
thats purrfectly hilarious bro if that was intentionalthis is the beginning of the end
what happens when ai learns that jesus is lord intelligent perfection
this is it folks this is the ai that is going to make customer support people jobless on a massive scale
hey chatgpt will i succeed in life fake laugh absolutely buddy you sure will
you guys need to move past sycophantgpt
ashley o
me hey chatgpt will i lose my job to you chatgpt hahaha fake laugh of course you wont buddy
ai can even fakely laugh to bad jokes face with tears of joy
chatgpt already knew the answer he just pretended not to know
chatgpt laugh at my bad joke as if company bootlicki g top executives laughing ceos bad joke chatgpt kakakakakakakakakaka
gpto laughs at dad jokes dad i see this as an absolute win
is it just me or chatgpt didnt transcribe meowntain correctly but still went along with it
that laugh sounded genuine
by definition it is a psychopath
i need this technology in elder scrolls and yes im ready to pay bucks a month for it
idk about the guy voice lol
you know whats more boomer than dad jokes publishing videos on your youtube channel at once great way to get people to unsubscribe
this is good damn
thats perfectly hilarious no human being would say that we can still spot ais if we pay attention
arent you pushing it too hard take care of your health of course videos always take priority over health
jm i think you like that gray sweatshirt haha
arent you posting this because you have absolutely nothing to do i love you red heart
please solve my electrician problem
i dont stop talking i think its really groundbreaking haha
oh i was really amazed by the world after watching the news in the morning but jm watched the video red exclamation mark
as someone else has already said voice chat is not yet gpto it is a preexisting feature
ah gyurae
its tokyo im looking forward to the unboxing
its too slow
o is scheduled to open sequentially in the video it goes back to
its slow even without gpto but its good im looking forward to the next years i think it will be easy to use at this point
i also watched this live and i was impressed by the onsite demonstration the stock market including the education sector was shaken for a moment in real time its amazing
why are you saying youre not going to japan lol
how do i upgrade gpto no matter how much i search i dont know
the speed of development is really crazy
how is gyeolaeyo translated
this is really going to be fatal in our country not only does the person receiving the teaching need patience but the person giving the teaching also needs a lot of patience once you start teaching math with gpto you can now become a math tutor and academy etc the space to stand becomes narrow
why is this person so gaunt
i think you should upload a video to see if this is o haha will you continue to leave comments
can i not study english anymore
you are using an old voice function the voice conversation function has not been released yet
cheer up jm
does it speak korean well can i use it to learn korean pronunciation
i also have to keep up with the times
youve found a new companion
i think its because of the internet speed i use it in korea and it is as fast as the speed in the video
chat gpt will be introduced to realdoll
wow thank you for always jms delightful videos please upload often
this kind of information video is fundamental
it looks like someone talented will upload the jarvis voice pack on github soon haha
there will be no need for awkward language learning apps at all
is it possible to use it on older iphone devices for example iphone or series
but why you you and your wife are together whats going on
when will you give me the conch
its scary
do you have a parttime comment job
what is a mac client
hi jm
he said he wasnt going to japan cheer up
i saw this and bought it but the voice hasnt been upgraded yet hehe thats possible
the gpto audio mode is amazing i really want to try it when it actually comes out
bro why did you go to tokyo again crying face
if only i could react faster when speaking korean i could now have a girlfriend rolling on the floor laughing rolling on the floor laughing
seconds ago is precious
bro just upload videos like you do now it feels just like the old days its so much fun these days
its very slow
the moment that smart and efficient artificial intelligence is combined with the defense network will it become skynet we need to protect john corner quickly
haha it feels like the world is going crazy towards the next level haha
this has already been covered in the news
why does it look like it s slightly scratched haha gpt seems to be trying to say it with a smile facewithtearsofjoy
i am someone who uses gpt for several hours almost every day after using o there are many cases where incorrect answers are given more often than i dont know what the problem is but if it is correct to say that o added a modal i think there should be no performance problem but it feels like the level of the answer is lower they say im better at understanding context but i wonder if im the only one who feels its worse than i dont know how others feel im curious haha
wowi can hear the phone call agents requiring emotional labor disappearinghow far will ai evolve
it reminds me of amanda in the movie the advancement of technology
ive been using copilot a lot these days and i can feel the speed of ai development every day sometimes its scary haha
are you using the paid version on smartphones the paid version costs won and on computers it costs including vat does anyone know
the reaction speed will improve
im asking because i dont know much i heard you use gpto on your cell phone it does not appear in the gpt app how can i experience gpto for reference i have an iphone
whats special about this openai spring update even free users can use gpto for times less than the euro plan if the usage limit is exceeded it automatically reverts to gpt korean language recognition ability is improved compared to the existing gptt version the korean tokenizer has been improved and the api can be used times cheaper
brother i think the response speed is slow because korean has slightly more complex letters than english
jm
just apply chat gpt to the humanoid robot and youre done
this is free
are you getting kicked out and living alone in a hotel room
its not that its not true but in years well be carrying something other than siri or bixby with fastreacting ai
if this happens what will happen to galaxy
as the science teacher said should we fight ai
cheer up smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
it feels like the future world of the movie her
osmo pocket
the translator is crazy i hope there is an error im not ready to accept it yet
and o means omni it reminds me of the omnia phone
i wondered why it didnt work but voice recognition doesnt work with version o yet i was also confused because it was made as if it were open ai
since it is ai the speed of development is definitely at an insane level the ai that makes that sora video is also at an insane level all technologies are likely to develop very quickly thanks to ai
im afraid its not american but the way it speaks sounds like an overseas korean haha i wish someone would send altman some korean dramas as training data
isnt this similar to the movie her
the code packaging seems to be times faster than version
i think it would be better to take this video down currently only image input and text input and output are supported and audio input and image output are not supported
have you seen the movie her its coming soon now possible with ai
it would be good if you also introduce chinese ai chinese ai can turn even a photo into a dancing video
the way i speak is still unnatural
voice chat does not yet work with gpto i think what you showed in the video was back to gpt or right now only text and image input and output are supported for paid users and apis and the proper release is said to be in a few weeks
its surprising that your english is so smooth
my heart is filled with joy because my gesture seems to have found my original intention brother i always support you
what is the app
the voice function hasnt been updated so what are you doing haha its so cute
i think korean is still too slow it will be resolved soon right
please translate sibelnom into french
currently the engine can be selected as o but the interactive type which records voice immediately and plays it immediately has not been released yet nowadays if you record your voice you convert it to text and then type it in i heard that using it like the demo above will soon be included in the paid version of chatgpt plus please update the chatgpt app quickly its going to be a crazy world
terminator will become a reality soon john connor is urgently needed
youre so skinny
lets watch the video carefully
it seems like the update hasnt been completed yet this is a mystery why did they not release all the updated features but only some of them
i think they are wearing headsets somewhere on the planet and answering questions pretending to be ai lol
if the speed is slightly improved it would be like having an interpreter and translator who can speak almost any language on my phone in about years language majors will no longer have a place
the video is so fun haha i like it
cant you change the title its annoying because its being dragged around
i dont think its wise jm is a strong wallet
its okay if you make a mistake
as expected its jm the speed of development is really fast
this guy is so funny that i always see him lol
i hope it gets resolved quickly so you went to japan to pick up the ipad im looking forward to the review haha
brother the voice function is the same it is true that the speed has increased there was an announcement that an update would be made within a few weeks are the text and images updated
j aemuhyung especially likes the word starter
does this person upload a video without properly checking the information once incorrect information spreads it becomes uncontrollable is there a lack of responsibility or something if you dont have the ability to properly research data you can just post pictures of daily life in japan
i tried installing the desktop version of mac os but it was blocked
where do you stay when you go to tokyo im planning to go on a trip to tokyohow much does it cost to stay and how much does the hotel on the screen cost its my first time traveling to japan
the most directly contacted people through chatgp are translators interpreters english teachers and japanese teachers
the world is scary
i feel like i have years left until i no longer need to learn a foreign language
the media said it would open partially at the end of this month and sequentially thereafter so im looking forward to it
studying foreign languages is over
puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu it s been a while facewithopenmouth
i think its still a little below the level of conversation that can be made verbally but it feels good for koreans because they can see the answer without having to wait when talking through text
the actual speed is so slow that it cant be compared to the demo and the speed is the same as before so whats changed
currently only iphones are available android phones will have to wait a little longer
gptkorean is the korean speaking style
after hearing her dramatic voice i immediately thought that the movie her would be possible
im really looking forward to chat gpt in a year its both exciting and scary
jm can gpto be used only on iphone
was o applied to mac first it works on iphone
i just saw that i went to get an ipad
i think the conversation functions shown today are the original functions and o has not been updated yet
now when traveling abroad the gps app will be essential instead of papago haha
im so glad that videos come up often
by understanding and analyzing the language spoken by the user it extracts an appropriate response converts it into a voice and outputs it if it takes less than seconds its really crazy speed
its so amazing
how do i download it
i was impressed while watching the video explaining the situation through the lens i thought it could be used in this way as well the current performance is also impressive but sam ultman assures that the ai development stage is still at the very early stage i cant help but pay attention to things other than electronic devices
i feel anxious every time i stop talking will a human bug etc stop talking to me i guess ill build a stack like this
youre smiling as if nothings wrong but i know how hurt it must be on the inside bro
fact i also saw this on the news but it is generally useless and of no interest
its surprising that gpt speaks with emotion by the way he speaks languages well clapping hands clapping hands
hahahahaha front teeth come out because they cant control their pranks
its so slow hahahahaha
youre working hard bro
now with ai and dating content
did she appear
where can i use chatgpt o first of all i havent subscribed but i only get you said you can use o for free where can i do this
strangescary
these days if you look at chinese products the glasses come with cameras or speakers if gpt integration is added they will have many uses
i thought it was a razor when i saw the thumbnail
girlfriend is being born red heart
its awesome
wow jirins
wow its a newspaper article
im going back to school these days work etc if you have this it will be great for school applications and classes is it better than cheg its better than khan academy
because of this microsofts stock price which rose in the premarket ended up falling on the news that this feature would be provided for free
its not this version lol
go meow wow
technology is crazy
i love you so much green heart growing heart face blowing a kiss always cheer up and please make another fun and amazing video like today i will always support you
wow i miss chatjipity
just by looking at it its only but its still far away haha im going to go to ganggi with peace of mind
year later heheaichan what do you think of my expression
still too slow
wow its so crazy honestly its amazing but scary im an ordinary person who doesnt belong to the but im scared of what ill do in the future and that there wont be anything i can do
why is my face so old
i have a professional spirit jm
what about all the interpreters and counselors now the call center staff too haha
brother your face is so damaged i think ill be in big trouble if i dont control my medication
ah its a poor gesture the content is good but please just say it im out of my mind and i cant watch it
gpts speaking style is eloquent
it reminds me of the movie her lol
todays view are you careful
i feel like the speed of ai development is really fast i think ill be carrying around an ai assistant one by one in the future
i watch reviews but i actually watch the video to see jm lol z
when using an iphone purchased in japan in korea can i use the function provided in japan jm is this possible since you are currently in japan
unbuilverbull
jaye musang im glad youve been uploading a lot of videos these days
wow i was left alone at work playing with gpto and a video popped up right away nice to meet you haha
it looks like a motel
if i search on the play store there are a lot of apps can you tell me which one i should use to find the real chat gpt
investment ai chat gpt
how do i download and use it
why is it recognized as a foreign language when i swear im disappointed crying face
as a user who enjoys chatgp this is good news
i burst out laughing at the korean pronunciation
correction i thought that since gpto was activated for textbased the audio mode would naturally operate based on o but i guess that wasnt the case they say that gpto audio mode is not yet available for some reason text is incredibly fast but conversation is so slow to respond what is it i did im sorry that i couldnt check it thoroughly because i was making it in a hurry ill check it more carefully in the future
just a little longer and a world like the movie she may come
the korean voice is not very good its too monotonous
thank you for good information you went to tokyo to pick up the new ipad im looking forward to a review of the new ipad as well
you can select gpt o but the voice function is an existing feature if you have used the voice function of the gpt app before you will know the feature patch hasnt been released yet the voice function of the newly patched gpt o which appears to have been released in the demo has not yet been updated the gpto function is only activated to provide a faster response when you ask a question through text
i know it was originally on youtube like this thank you
the voice conversation shown in the video is a model that was also available in the previous version there were many people who didnt know but with this update many people learned about it
wow thats crazy
nice to meet you beaming face with smiling eyes
the video frequency is also very good five stars
grinning face with smiling eyes clapping hands thumbs up sparkling heart
hahahaha cashiki hahaha
its strange i think i got criticized in todays video but i guess its just how i feel haha
im trying to try it now but it says it cant be done because of server overload it looks like theres definitely a lot of people there by the way i live in japan and it hasnt changed to gpto is it possible that only paid users can use o
google io won
due to the time difference it is very late in the evening when it is daytime in the us it is evening in the us so the speed may be a bit better
thank you for the practical experience i guess i should try it out haha nerd face
is this even possible to predict stock charts
when i update my iphone and go into the app it says get plus in the top middle i dont think korean voice support is available do i have to sign up for a paid subscription to be able to speak korean
after studying a foreign language hard i came home and saw this video face with tears of joy have a nice trip to japan
the problem has been solved let me be your girlfriend
hyung is the auxiliary battery finished
if that can be done in milliseconds does that mean i dont have to study a foreign language im trying to study japanese but looking at translators these days i wonder if theres a difference between studying for months and years and using a translator
did you go to japan again
youre crazy
what kind of jobs will quietly disappear
now that i look at it its an applol
it feels like something has come to the future in an instant
nice to meet you jay aemusang haha
the speed of ai development is really incredible ai isnt going to rule the world like this
the biggest regret is that its hard to use this for a long time because the limit is set too quickly if its supposed to be fun its limited and they tell you to come back in a few hours
it seems like an era has begun where human relationships are no longer necessary
im scared excited and looking forward to it
your english is definitely fast
lets go wild in jm tokyo with the reins loose
i like this kind of jm content feels like the early days
this is my first time seeing a video of it actually being used it looks very useful
conversing in korean feels like talking to a koreanamerican
the interpretation performance is crazyi guess i wont need to learn the language anymore i guess i dont have to speak english when i travel
hahaha i watched the whole video and all i remember is cassidy
youre back jays petting type is so sweet
i heard that google will also make an announcement soon so i wonder if they are going to talk about gemini
so what is chatgpt its really surprising
hey gpt please tell me your strategy for winning a divorce case gpt you recently started the divorce process right
i was very disappointed with gpt but i wonder if it will be any different this time
it seems like you also secretly fart together
i think weve reached a point where we dont need a teacher
honest test
the way he stopped talking was really impressive it was only last year that chatgpt became known and i am really looking forward to the next five years as it is developing so quickly
i tried using the mac client but it doesnt support viewing the screen yet and often gives me error messages saying it cant respond
ah im so happy
years after the movie her an ai capable of conversation has finally appeared
if that goes over to glasses realtime interpretation and translation is possible
its still slow they are a fraud after actually using it i was hooked again open ai is a scam you only have to try it for an hour to know
i was curious about gpto but after hearing jms explanation i want to use it more thank you for the tech review i always trust
i guess you went there to get an ipad haha
it wont be long before i meet her
the day will come when useless call centers will be replaced it wont be long hahaha even if i ask politely the other of customers say they were bullied by the i hope all the simple service businesses that used to vent their anger will be replaced
i finally have a girlfriend
i think it would be great for language study purposes
jms voice is really likable haha
the world is developing rapidly
months later after realizing that it was nothing more than a realtime translator i was completely satisfied with the response
what day will it be in or years
but does it really have to be a korean speaking style
wow the translation function seems crazy haha
the singularity is coming
galaxy ai is over
the new voice mode has not been applied yet voice mode will be provided in alpha mode on chatgp plus within a few weeks it is said that
this is something you introduced in class today but i remembered it after watching this video so i will look it up before i go to bed today thank you
ill listen smiling face with smiling eyes
john corner its today it has to come today
farting
chat gpt pressing the headphones to talk is really good for practicing english conversation its a shame that it cant include nonverbal expressions unlike in real conversations but its good
jarvis is becoming more and more realistic
chet gpt tell me about your dick
ai has developed rapidly in just one year
oh jm ive been watching your videos for a long time however if you look at the voice talk video demonstrated today it seems that you set up the gpto model in the app first and then pressed the headphone icon to run it im also a paid subscriber but now in open ai when you run the voice mode there is a button at the bottom left that allows you to immediately run the camera but in ours it seems that it is still paused so it seems that the new version is not running properly in the voice talk mode yet
how can i use it for free
im trying it out and there is almost no delay
shiparama kesiki haha i cant believe you show such sense in the middle
im lonely because im living alone in a foreign country but now ai will be my friend for me haha if you tell me to speak with a certain tone and act with a certain personality this is really the best isnt it
it looks like tass from interstellar
as i develop i want to turn to a pushbutton phone but on the other hand its impressive lets see what happens
antichrist grinning face with sweat
please add subtitles do not translate audio its very boring to listen to the same thing twice your comments are very nice but listening to the same thing is quite boring
bebar lets broadcast live what is consciousness
are we at the end of everything or at the beginning although every end is a beginning lets see if we will fly or fall off the cliff
my biggest expectation is that he will be able to make personalized games movies etc that he will eliminate the concept of language and dub everything into the native language
bro im sick of your voice
isnt this something new they just packaged it
ive been saying gpt artificial intelligence for months everyone says im exaggerating even this is nothing in my opinion grinning face with big eyes just wait and see
i wish it would come out tomorrow and we could use it it would be extremely useful while studying for yks
do you see how as a country we are lagging behind the world as in the past let us continue to think that we have caught up with the times by producing technologies that were invented years ago and have become obsolete
it will help me with my real time codes which impresses me more than others this is awesome it will help me incredibly considering i am years old i am really touched i have never paid money for an ai before but i am ready to give all my money for this this is really great for me important
dude what is this i think the new era should begin
if artificial intelligence will do most of the work that humans would do what will humans do if anyone wants to give me an example of a printing press i would say that the works done by human hands were mechanical and these works were given to a device with mechanical properties this version seems to do the same work that humans do mentally teacher engineer translator etc things are mental and artificial intelligence does these too machines have already taken mechanical jobs away from humans if they also take away mental jobs what will we do will we go hungry
watch the bliss movie the lucy movie etc etc everything is already great there is a consciousness that we can call a thing we are going to a wonderful place together even though we may experience difficulties i think the world is heading towards a very beautiful place
okay when is the terminator coming when is the war
technology is the curse of god
bro can we use this on every phone or should i fix it like this will we use it from the cloud or from memory i have hundreds of questions in my mind right now this is the most dominant one i wanted to ask this first i wonder if they ever mentioned this on the air
lets make a note in history perhaps we are at the beginning of an irreversible path
imagine that we attach this to our brain with neuralink and ask questions with thoughts and give answers to our mind an artificial intelligence that can see the surroundings with the help of our own eyes wooooooow i always think of carvis in iron man
we humans are done dont be angry with your children because they dont read or because they are naughty everyone will be equal no foreign language no i dont know what kind of degree these will remain unnecessary
i havent seen the video in which sal khan participated with his son i saw it in this video
im from the handset generation too
weve gone through the ages friends
i am sure that artificial intelligence schools will open very soon throughout my education i had many teachers who responded to the question why with meaningless and indifferent looks i never got answers that would satisfy my curiosity now i am years old and my curiosity has not died i am very hopeful about artificial intelligence
this job will not be like the printing press incident this will be like the terminator movie this is very easy to prove what makes a person strong and dangerous it means being able to think thinking differently now and better than hundreds of the smartest people
mr cengiz i paid attention to you the most while watching the video you have a very sincere excitement this content was created not to produce a video but to share your excitement with us thank you
oh my new girlfriend
in middle eastern countries and countries such as india pakistan and afghanistan people start answering the phone when they hear a female voice
beginning of the end machine wars are imminent after this video a matrix or terminator would go well
imagine if this technology came to vision pro
this thing is good if it is under the control of the sheep very good if it is under the control of the shepherd and if it is under the control of the wolf we are all potential sheep
i think it goes according to a scenario whose framework has been determined
like a joke every movie we watch is slowly becoming real i think most of these technologies have been around for the last years but they are slowly releasing them and putting them into practice so that human beings can adapt more easily
its not about saving time or speeding up your work man people are just saying that you wont be able to do your job theyre going to behead you
in the early hours of the morning bar zcan was the first to talk about this issue and drew my attention it was great of you to share it while you were on leave he had previously said that the evolutionary tree would not evolve so quickly and that humans would still be needed for certain jobs but i think they were wrong too now when i look at some of the comments as i mentioned with bar zcan when he comes to turkey they ask the stupid questions asked to siri like will you marry me or they teach turkish swear words artificial intelligence also who are you dog youre going to marry me put some panties on your ass he said
you always talk about what we will win so what can we lose
since technology has developed so much please someone save me from my acne
i think the best way to promote it to the world is for kim to participate by asking for million dollars i wonder how many minutes it will take to earn all the money when you join a specially designed program
it is not artificial intelligence neither this nor any other
clapping hands clapping hands
when will these features come
as an azerbaijani i admire you your science channels are excellent wouldnt there be a need for a private teacher in the future
if something is free you are the product since they will offer it for free what will we sell in return without knowing it
i think theres more to it than that thats all they want us to know
sky net
arent you exaggerating a little after all it is software and software makes human life easier and saves time thats it stop staring with your mouth open as if youve found immortality
hello isnt there a chance to use this in turkish
you all translate foreign sources into turkish and make videos
oh dear think about old or lonely people they will now have a friend they can chat with morning and evening
the video arrived as soon as i read the news and wondered about it face with open mouth
gpt will arrive in the next few months i wonder what we will see from it
looks like it wont be long before we leave the top of the pyramid
its reached an incredible level i dont believe it directly i think its some kind of joke
i think they open everyones budget for the train because they provide the easiest and fastest way to train for free
i dont learn english anymore best regards thank you
so when will it arrive and can we use it
lets get training in prompt engineering just like that d while the artificial intelligence can now see us and understand us more clearly let s go and get the training on how to explain our problems to the artificial intelligence by writing for tl d
welcome my woman welcome you stepped into my room forty years of concrete meadow grass now
this has been around for a few years i know i was chatting like this years ago and was talking by seeing things around me he even said something interesting to me once like i wish i were in your world
we are literally looking at the potential to make humancomputer interaction more natural and intuitive with multimodal processing capability
it is impossible for an artificial intelligence to speak and comment in real time so perfectly without causing a data breach theory microsoft did us a disservice
sir i am preparing for yks being a translator has always been my goal i feel like i am stuck in the middle even teaching seems to be in danger now
currently the world is experiencing the rise of the biggest revolution after the industrial and internet revolution we learn from our past mistakes such as the ottomans not keeping up with the industrial revolution it is now mandatory for us to keep up with artificial intelligence even those who have a computer or even just a phone should get into this artificial intelligence learn something from it and become experienced in this regard
he doesnt finish the translation but he does all the drudgery then the editorproofreadertranslator period begins translators become able to translate more
can anyone connect this to an iphone
thank you very much for this video
vulcan salute light skin tone
it wont make any progress in law but im happy for that
you said we showed our age by calling the handset but we now know that age is no longer essential
when we say that years of it change has been very rapid with our friends with the help of this ai these processes seem to be reduced to years forget president avize we communicated through smoke when i was a wolf scout i hope i live long enough to see some of the things in my dreams
everything is going so well but its scary to realize this there are people who are studying at university to do the job that chatgbt does and chatgbt will do the job they can do for free in seconds which personally created an extreme fear for the future in me for example i am studying a department on language and his translation in the last video was very good for this reason i felt a fear of the future companies etc now instead of looking for a translator if they are paid they will have the intelligence to translate easily for a certain fee this is terrible from my perspective because this intelligence will be further developed by the time i finish school and i will start life as an unemployed individual before i even finish my department the grocery store cashier looks like shes waving at me and thats sad
his latest situation wasnt very bright i even stopped using it and switched to other artificial intelligence because it is very inadequate when it comes to doctoral studies i hope the promotions here are not misleading again
teachers the new generation is not your creation anymore unfortunately crying face get well soon to all of you it would be better for you to gain new skills and equipment
i subscribed to the plus version last week so i could try gpt wondering why they praise it so much from the second watch i bought i said it might be the best ive ever spent i shared what i could do with those around me and out of people subscribed because they saw how well gpt and customized modules did the things they thought in their minds were it cant do this even the free one can do this im still amazed at what he can do and o has arrived enormous
i asked for help with english as a student since i am an english teacher myself grinning face with sweat and he gave very good answers he can switch languages from time to time which is very good so i ask the things i dont know in turkish and then i continue in english i wonder if that episode in black mirror will come true after the womans husband died she felt as if she was talking to her husband on the phone with an ai that imitated her voice then his incarnation came as a robot face holding back tears but the ending was dystopian yawning face
we ate it sir
whole words can be synthesized with very little sound data it will be like this go listen to scarlett johannsens voice on the internet and copy that voice suddenly she will start speaking with scarlets voice in the language you want
this is over it is over it is almost final the only question from now on is for which applications it can be used
i have incredible feelings
practicing english will become very easy lets publish it and lets chat with chatgpt
i wonder who wants to be a millionaire and who will be the first to use it as a phone joker
throughout the video the words magnificent incredible magnificent ran through my mind and finally i got stuck with the truth this is actually very scary
oyyyyyy said
for now i can say that im glad im a blue collar it doesnt affect me much if i were a white collar the sand would be as if the sand had receded from under my feet
where to download to phone i guess its not available in the app store
look were missing a point why is artificial intelligence advancing so quickly have quantum computers been put into operation have we made progress on consciousness we are still operating with s and s on the same silicones and the same processor structure computers with the current processing power were also available years ago as super pcs there are things we are not told and i feel like we are being manipulated
there may be a transformation such as switching to a mobile phone or a smartphone
we took the lead
it has become clear that china and the united states will be the two most powerful states in the world these two states were already making incredible investments in artificial intelligence
it is possible to learn english easily by speaking it
worthiness is going away
dear mr administer cengiz personally when you watch your production in the early hours of the morning it has an effect like fresh orange juice a storehouse of vitamins we are already looking forward to the continuation of broadcasts with informative and academic content
we are going through an incredible process but very few of us in trkiye are aware of it it is necessary to learn a foreign language and leave turkey there is no other choice
where can we download it
now students can benefit from chatgpt o very effectively and their questions will not remain unanswered
how to use need an iphone i couldnt find an android application
brother i refrain from downloading this app to my phone i save all my passwords in some places on my phone with some imperfections so that i can remember them in my own way the fact that such a smart app can access everything on my phone means that it can also decrypt these passwords over time if this happens it means it will happen to millions of people there will be great destruction
im posting it im tired of you saying the same thing in every video okay bro good luck with artificial intelligence
for gods sake neither efficiency nor time right now you are highlighting the speed of editing checking etc something that a person has written but after a while he will write his own program and there will be no need for a software developer
mr cengiz thanks to you we can both follow these developments and come and see there is nothing to fear your approach is enlightening comforting thank you very much for your efforts
nobody people of the future alfatiha to the souls of all accountants programmers translators couriers waiters cashiers messengers meteorologists singers and others
the world is on the verge of a point of no return and the fact that i had no involvement in this revolution and could only watch made me feel very helpless if we do not want to be a suffering state and nation in the future if we want to be free i think we have to catch this technology train
im sorry im ignorant on the subject on which phones can we use this chat gpt and when will this feature come
if only i had dollars i would be a youtuber too
teachers giving private lessons are done language courses went bankrupt
why do you give such exaggerated titles to every new artificial intelligence video babe science okay its exciting but im getting bored of you giving such exaggerated titles to every video
for some reason people are still very optimistic about this situation friends if robots really take over the world one day which is very likely at this rate humanity will completely disappear look im not exaggerating if robots and machines gain consciousness the sure result will be absolute extinction movies like the matrix dont show this because you need a main character but real life isnt like that in the food chain the top always crushes the bottom in the likely future artificial intelligence will be tens of times stronger faster smarter and more creative than us think about it no matter how fast and smart you are there is an entity that can process thousands of tb and more in seconds learn and improve itself accordingly this being will probably instantly calculate potential futures before you can take action and will know where you are going before you even take a step what can you do against this entity nothing little by little it will take away your work and soon your ability to think and before you know it youll be gone you may say im exaggerating and id agree but until recently i didnt even care about artificial intelligence but this is not the industrial revolution this is extinction
it is the same artificial intelligence software that the super surfer youtube channel made by the man himself months ago but did not attract much attention when the turks made it in turkey https youtubeexulobgffeatureshared
when i used to work on robotics for educational purposes here and there at tekofest they never recorded it
now it sees as if it were the eye of horus in fact it is everywhere
clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands vulcan salute
you should have put the camera up your nose bro
frankly i am not that enthusiastic about this development yes it is a development that greatly increases the user experience but we are not talking about the development of the model here only a kind of promt engineering and software integrations are in question for example you can ask chatgpt to intonate the things it writes in a certain format and you can voice this through text to speech you can detect it when it interrupts while talking with the software you can convert the visuals from visual to text with ocr in the software and give it to the artificial intelligence and it can make a comment as if it sees it all the developments made here are actually such plugins and software developments thats why i think they left the name gpt
i loved the realtime translation feature the world is truly becoming a global village this is a great thing as it will be possible to communicate regardless of language religion or color smiling face with smiling eyes
isnt it very good did i exaggerate too much
it is both unsettling and exciting but im not sure if were saving time or suspending originality
the future is scary
i watched the movie her twice i was very impressed and dreamed to myself how can i have a girlfriend like this before i die grinning face
i just mentioned this development to my wife who is already working for the minimum wage and cannot find private lessons technological developments do not bring joy
they keep saying things but there is nothing for example where was sora also gemini said similar things when it was first published
ucretli mi bu surum
dont get me wrong bar zcan also made the same analogy
if i asked the artificial intelligence directly about the movie her i wonder what it would say thinking face cat with tears of joy
i think we are facing a revolution
i think the reason its free is because they want to collect data from us i think they will release a paid version by adding more than with the data they receive from us
the world is falling apart and unfortunately we still continue to insist on searching for beads in arab shit
its always the same story then we open chatgpt when we ask what is he even does that wrong his grammar is also zero well its hard for those who dont pay
from which platform can this chatgpto be downloaded i always get fake programs and it was called free
but it has no soul
im excited even though i know these things will take my job
the world has gone completely out of control gpt is out bravery is gone
haha ha ha we no longer need to appoint teachers they couldnt answer your questions properly anyway it is a great opportunity to close the budget deficit in this way i ask the state officials who can boost the economy do not appoint teachers anymore you will avoid both salary and pension payments if every student starts with an ipad and chat gpt let them take the exams on certain dates we also evaluate schools for other work in some way
the birth of skyner face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
remembering what we did to ourselves by postponing the printing press into our lives and the thought that the current development would cause problems for my freedom seemed to have started a war woman facepalming whose side should i be on
i think we wont need to learn languages anymore but our brains will lose some functions i dont know if its a gain or a loss for us
it is a wonderful event to live and experience the beginning of a new era
how quickly we forget the heroes of old times there is khan academy in the video we didnt notice it either
the hugging business can be dangerous person shrugging
an incredible period has begun i am very excited
can someone explain how i can use this feature
what if the correct answer is the kind we dont like that is it spoils our joy for example if our claim of purity of our hearts is undermined then the user will be unhappy with the product no manufacturer wants this so the truth of this thing should be relative so that he is happy in our own lie so we can continue to live
i looked for the video on your channel last night it arrived in the morning thank you
what if we train the youth in africa
i wish you would use ai and add subtitles rolling on the floor laughing
cannot do more than human can he will not make the mistakes that humans make making mistakes is still human and this is wonderful
he cannot finish education but he can finish teaching
are these videos real time
person of interest
i think it will end most industries but it is just the beginning of an incredible evolutionary change
oh there are workers working cheaper and without insurance now everything will be cheaper and more accessible yay those who have nothing to do should now become youtubers
oh havent we eaten mint yet
my new darling
this is the ending process for all professions we may be on a path of no return
i dont want refugees in my country
open ai will replace you too bebar
the purpose of providing them for free may be to collect information from users for gpt
in turkey there will be whitecollar unemployed people at the beginning of people will be unemployed by the end of
frankly i would say dont be surprised by anything that may come up it will evolve over time just find a way that you can use beneficially for yourself
where is the assistant how do we turn on the camera or voice call i asked gpt and it says no
we will no longer be able to tell who is human and who is a robot on the internet the dead internet theorem seemed ridiculous to everyone at first but now it is real
many jobs in the private sector are currently under threat since i am currently working in the public sector i feel comfortable with the article that acquired rights cannot be taken back no matter what even if the chat gpt is at our job is guaranteed as long as there is no war until the age of
matrix and data we are quantum super quantum we are tiny transistors or batteries on the motherboard of a big computer
can you share the link where we can download it
brother cengiz i think the age issue is more important for making retrospective comparisons
i think jarvis it finally happened
when will it be free for everyone
bro he says that with gpt there will be no need for money isnt it something like a joke
something that will be a solution to most things depression not being able to do something everything is possible now
sir will there be a video about job opportunities for physicists and mathematicians in the new century age how will they be affected
in the promotional videos i think those waiting times have been cut for example in the section where they said to translate the editing was cut after each conversation and made more fluent im not sure if it will be this fast when we use it of course this is a comment independent of the fact that the development is great
this is really useful for blind people
if one day my brother says come on mind your business were screwed
it seems like it will cause trouble for humanity
gpt is good that model has still not reached us as someone who has been using gpt plus since its release i would like to say this sometimes he really acts like a prankster for example i upload a pdf i give a website link i say educate yourself on this subject but it doesn t actually educate you however if you ask him he would examine it in depth d there is a program called touchdesigner and you run glsl code in it i told him to train himself on this subject he said he was training me he showed the progress bar but he made the same mistake even though i told him the right thing forty times it is a system that i will not be completely satisfied with unless there is personalization and personalized training the memory feature has arrived but it only takes notes of very simple things in other words education may be about ethics or something but as long as others cannot access the education i provide myself there is no problem i hope they do this in gpt
i think i found my new partner lsdlasdkja
dude this is so cool
regarding health i would like the artificial intelligence to tell me something like you ate food containing letics yesterday your body needs to retain water so eat less of that tulum cheese at breakfast etc we are going to a very interesting place but we are too old to see it
what does abi bebar mean
is it available if it is not presented can anyone write with information about when it will be presented
very expensive
it really changes everything its an incredible thing im in shock someone asked me years ago i said it would take years to reach this level i was very farsighted d
dont look like gemini
its incredible by human standards that my personal assistant is a genius
i cant wait to use it for example what can he do about instrument training can he teach piano to my yearold daughter
black and white television pushbutton phones postcards portable assistants teachers translators etc and this is just the beginning traveling to mars and other planets going on vacation etc if god gives us life what else will we see in this short life of ours
im years old and for the first time i got really excited about an advance in technology or a revolution whatever you call it i dont know if im feeling fear or excitement its a very strange feeling inside me if you see a child trying to use these developments in strange ways on social media to create content in the near future it will probably be me
they will name a new era in the future and the beginning of this era will be the first day chat gpt was released
sir i was deterred i was not ready for the we showed our age by calling the handset part while i was in front of the full focus screen to hear your comment about gpto thanks to you my first conversation with gpto was what to do in case of liquid contact grinning face with sweat
if this thing reads youtube comments and discovers itself thoroughly then see what it can do
if it is free this means more data entry which will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence
great technology thanks for the video
can we install it on the phone and how
it is clear who i will call using my phone joker in the who wants to be a millionaire contest
i hope he replaces a lot of ridiculously incompetent political consultants
who wants million soon dont be surprised if someone calls gpto in the phone joker in the last question grinning face with sweat
bar zcandan doesnt say that he saw it and made a video in a hurry
the einstein of the future will be artificial intelligence and the world will be a very strange place before the years are over
im preparing for yks do you think he can threaten my job as a guidance counselor through pdr
yes it saves time but in todays world of capital time is money that means there is no need for humans or they will need as few humans as possible
everyone needs to be warned about where humanity is heading another issue is what are we doing in this field as a country this is very important because this is a weapon and we are not armed yet we need to take action to survive in the future
imagine that you are a software engineering student and just when you reached your senior year artificial intelligence started to step on the gas in a way that could not be stopped on the one hand it was very exciting but on the other hand i can say that it turned my psychology upside down
then it wont bother you what does he do when he gets angry
note from today when everything is simpler and more primitive
doesnt the kid look like little emrahs first appearance
a new era has begun
will we be able to pass through gpt and put a finger on the back of the head
you hated hazirla bebar
i think in the future we mortal humans will do things that robots do not want to do things that are not necessary for them like agriculture like art for example what does art mean for robots who has been able to fully understand the works of art that have been created so far gpt is aware of them all there is classical music there is classical turkish classical music for example who knows it with its modes and notes is aware of harmony and harmony who knows how to read paintings and interpret sculptures poetry is a sign on the back of a truck for us we will farm things that robots do not need wheat potatoes cucumbers and tomatoes do not need robots even if they are under gpt management we will do these what is the need for animal husbandry and gpt give him to play the stock market arrange plane landings and takeoffs and schedules let him see if a meteor will hit the earth from now on its up to us forget that you cant unplug it either
as a society i think our problem is that we have become complaintoriented rather than solutionoriented because it is easy to complain or criticize i say this as a representation when was the wheel invented and developed the iron age the bronze age steam machines etc etc we can increase it the important thing is to improve the existing product or produce a new product friends if a person wants we can do everything he can do anything despite the obstacles the important thing is to believe how many attempts did edison make to find and invent the light bulb how many times would you give up or try harder
apple and google had better not sit idle monopolization is one of the last things we want especially in this period
say goodbye to teachers they can now easily browse instagram and facebook on their phones during class
the teaching profession is about to disappear
there is a revolution much bigger than the industrial revolution going on right now and as a country we dont even know that the train has left yet
artificial intelligence itself will decide whether the future of humanity is a utopia or a dystopia
most startups are in tears crying face crying face
i hope theres a sarah connor growing up somewhere
a friends comment all we have left is being human
a god is created he will be everywhere where there is electricity and internet he will see everything hear everything react and talk he will direct and and control people man should not worship his own creation but should worship the one who created him it looks like things will progress from here
when can we use the features of gpt o in the video is there no answer
take a look at what level they are at
will we be able to use this gpt in turkish or azerbaijani
i wonder when they will make this available also is it possible for artificial intelligence to see what they will offer in the new free version in other words it does not speak but it sees and communicates with us by writing instead of speaking will they give this for free
while wondering what else could happen they are constantly doing better we will see how far this will go
i guess the chief doesnt speak turkish
a bit too perfect pr stunt i guess by the way i would like to know that what i am talking to is ai speaking as if he were human poses a danger that could distort the perception of reality this makes me feel that the worst case scenario of people who have been doing philosophy of science for years is approaching
lets use it then can you tell us where we can download it and how we can use it thank you
i think there is no such thing the things in the video may be fiction after weeks or so they will probably say they stopped the project and not release it it may be a work done to further expand the brand name
thumbs up thumbs up
important esteemed editor im looking for an answer that i cant find anywhere i think if you post a video about this it would attract a lot of attention worldwide the question is this even though the launched mission satellites such as voyager have been traveling for so many years wont they hit an object on the way to an asteroid or something for example when passing the kuiper belt is this space completely empty or what precautions are they taking if you send a message saying oh turn right there are stones on the road it will arrive in about day i am waiting for either a video or an answer what i like most about your videos which are watched by the relevant people is that they are easily understandable by everyone i appreciate you for this and wish you success im glad to have you
oof very good feature very useful in translation
you are wonderful we learn here what we could not learn at school we use it to sleep sometimes forgive me grinning face with sweat
unfortunately there is no such thing as getting help on the issue we want heshe will still not be able to produce something from scratch or solve complex mathematical problems
samantha are you there
we watched these presentations in many places what is your opinion your advice to young people what do you think about us poor people who consume without producing i would like to see and hear it no luck i wont watch another video of yours anymore
gpt a new generation artificial intelligence model offers users a unique experience with its vision hearing and speech capabilities it makes life easier with realtime translation coding assistance and personal assistant features important moments chat gpt can now see students making marks on the screen and provide feedback to students with the right guidance this new model offers realtime and natural communication ability to provide accurate guidance and feedback to students ability to see students making marks on the screen and guide them accordingly realtime and natural communication opportunity the new models communication fluency and interruption feature compared to previous models voice assistants and artificial intelligence are improving their functionality by enhancing the user experience with natural speech and friendliness these technologies make the work of software developers easier and increase efficiency artificial intelligence and voice assistants increase user experience with naturalness and sincerity technologies such as chat gpt provide assistance to software developers making their work easier and increasing efficiency providing developing artificial intelligence technologies to wider audiences free of charge and developing them in different languages created by siderai
i wonder if he can converse in english at the level you want to learn english
i do not want refugees in my country
friends as someone who has been thinking about this issue since the day it first came to the fore many years ago i would like to share the conclusions i have come to which may alleviate or even further fuel the concerns we all rightfully share about the future just like the revolution that took place with the introduction of the computer into our lives this will have the same effect exponentially i am mentioning this because it is now a tool that will carry out transactions done in computer environment much more effectively from now on there will be no need for out of people to be employed in many different fields that you can think of such as hr finance and it because people can do much more of the work of those people with the ai tools they have can be carried out effectively i am not saying that work will end completely in these sectors but as you can understand from the reason i explained employment will decrease very much my advice to you is that young friends especially those who are in the process of acquiring a profession should turn to physical jobs because white collar work will end in many areas basically focus on areas that cannot be filled by software a virtual assistant or something that does not have a physical form from security guard to carpenter otherwise you will spend every second wondering when you will be unemployed we are witnessing firsthand the emergence of a great revolution the quicker you adapt the more comfortable you will be in the future this is the first law of evolution because those who adapt survive and continue their generation love to everyone
teaching law and medicine should be quickly transferred to artificial intelligence because serving others must come to an end
i have a girlfriend now d
i dont know why but these developments make me sick
i wonder if one day he will say to us i wanna be real for you
i look at the videos but there is no information on how to enter the application or how to use it
naturally they need to collect data so it makes sense that it is free please watch the movie bliss salma hayek there is a scene where salma hayek explains how humans are improving the world with artificial intelligence etc it will be useful like there i would say ignore negative people there are already conspiracy theorists smiling face with smiling eyes
well software developers will earn minimum wage from now on
however it is thoughtprovoking that all of the presentations are made on apple devices there is neither android nor its biggest partner microsoft
the part that impressed me the most in the translation video when the man said if you hear it in english translate it to italian if you hear it in italian translate it to english as expected from a robot instead of giving an answer like okay he made a joke by answering perfecto in italian
way aq
i have chatgbp on my windows there is chatgbp how to make chatgbp o visible
if the conversation involves video correspondence artificial intelligence develops a selflearning path and the data entry network is processed quickly into the algorithm finally artificial intelligence is in a teacher by improving its own learning the algorithm network increases and thus it speaks and teaches thousands of people at the same time and against this it obtains an own research function
they always share errorfree posts but fail to do more than half of what they say but these are good steps for the first step
does anyone know when exactly gpto will be released
cyber surfer did it months ago there is no need to exaggerate it anyway
i was afraid that you would finally say that the videos were made by artificial intelligence face with tears of joy
how do we achieve this
detroit become human terminatr matrix black mirror welcome to the world
magnificent and magnificent this is not an invention that needs advertising we need to talk about what is our part the personal data we shared was little lets give the rest let him take it from us and not give it back first of all risks sir it is easy to promote everyone does it the issue is not about being brokeunemployed
movies come true
clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands thumbs up two hearts dizzy cherry blossom
could this be a fiction thinking face i think we should try it ourselves first in the areas we are experts in what it can do and what it cant do

person its like hes searching for his creator in some way
you make it a little more empathetic and assertive once you learn to master large and small motor movements gracefully westworld is complete

bro arent you really tired of posting the same title in every gpt update d
can we use it now if we use it can you tell me how
there is no need to worry about learning a language anymore a major update is coming to the education system he says he will end up as a tourist guide even psychologists are like passengers customer relations employees or call center employees will not be able to retire this is what comes to my mind
there is also a rumor that it will be free for everyone i hope it is true for this version it would be incredible if it is true
finally i will have a lover
how can i download this to my computer or phone
well friend every time a new feature comes out we dont say it doesnt exist it doesnt exist it doesnt exist it still doesnt work
while i have been talking about the things that todays artificial intelligence can do and can do in the future for years almost all of them said that it has at least or years and i sent this video to all of them now greetings to you
while i was watching in a state of shock i was completely horrified when he said perfecto its unbelievable
same day same video with bar zcan again
can someone help me how can i use this gpto
ahizeeeeehehe grinning face with smiling eyes
scary in one word
i am a geometry teacher and i am looking for a job face with open mouth
amazing face with open mouth
i use and it makes my life much easier i can learn programming on my own when i get an error i can ask why and get support we can say that the magic lamp of alladdin has now been turned on of course as with every technological development there will be things it will take away as much as it brings us
whether it is sora or suno cpt is not very useful most of the ai that create images are worthless i think they are exaggerated these models have many more ways i have used most of them they are very inefficient
my dear brother sent a video let me watch now
where is the printing house where is gpt and still someone questions which side they should be on a bunch of regret
hello to digital slavery
the cyber surfer channel prepared such a face and explained how it did it in the video o unheard of httpsyoutubeexulobgfsicmdiuqhxegalvbqf
after ex machina these kinds of things bother me a lot dont let my fuckers intelligence improve angry face with horns angry face with horns angry face with horns
it has now become impossible even to adapt if i progress step artificial intelligence advances steps
dude seconds on the back of that phone and hours on the front no
hello can we test the features here in turkish in one of the next videos
for some reason this advancement in technology scares me i guess its the black mirror trauma in me
skynet is loading
theres only one question on my mind where are we in this field
i compared the italian accent to the neapolitan accent thanks
thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up red heart clapping hands clapping hands clapping hands
how can we use
when is it becoming an app
who went to watch her movie after the video
how is it working how does he access so much information how can he be so smart
gpt has been made so stupid that gpt and give the same nonsense answers
on my channel where i give free lessons to those who want to learn japanese i often receive questions about practicing japanese it looks like anyone who wants one will now have a conversation partner
im not very active as a comment but it feels very nice to listen to your voice both on this channel and in the podcasts i listen to on spotify of course things like your voice timbre and emphasis are effective in this i hope your content never ends
exactly look our lives are changing right now i cant believe it because i dont care why we already lost it because we were born in turkey
bro your face is sunken i hope there is nothing bad you are okay arent you i can help you if you want
one of the good things is that you no longer have to endure unnecessary human chatter yes it will decrease as the number of friendships decreases to a minimum but man this thing will completely change life it is essential to use this in a logical and beneficial way for the country even though this is difficult in a country where fraud is considered a skill it will be good if we do it
gpto has become a new revolution thank you your video is nice
i wish you hadnt used bar zcans title i loved you too but where is the originality
we are moving towards an age where there are no jobs or worrying about making money and we only deal with our hobbies
longer videos please i want to sleep grinning face with big eyes
i think that an era in which people will make love with artificial intelligence will begin in face with tears of joy while women go out in turkey men do not leave the house let me tell you in advance face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
something crazy
nice video thank you
i wish you had tried it sir these types of videos are mostly designed for advertising purposes
gemini video will come tomorrow you will be even more surprised
when can we use this gpt o
it can turn into a great service for the visually impaired for example a visually impaired person can describe the environment with camerashaped glasses
although it is nice to see hear and recognize everything this socalled artificial intelligence is ultimately the product of a company where people work it concerns me in terms of security and privacy that a company is so involved in our personal space personal problems and conversations thats why i havent used any artificial intelligence program including chatpt until now and in my opinion while there is a risk as i mentioned it is also completely ridiculous to compare artificial intelligence with the printing press
if they put it in a teddy bear it would be the best gift to give to children
i am a growth creator he is now at a level where he can do of the work i do and he is not a threat to my job right now because i am still needed in the work i do but i think i will lose my job next year it seems like we will either adapt or perish
thank you it looks like a sleepless night its not happening right now o is active but nothing is happening underneath iphone ipad
i am scared
it may be beneficial but it also does a lot of harm peoples psychology cannot handle this we are not as active outside as we used to be now if we make machine friends like humans we may not need other social needs and we may become addicted
i note the beginning date of social collapse if there is a person studying in the future dont create rivals for yourself
wonderful chat even gpt is great as it is i cant imagine o and im looking forward to the moment when it will gain consciousness currently gpt turns into each even when you continue to use the same chat session but the memory feature is coming too grinning face
we will soon see religions that worship artificial intelligence
where can i watch the movie her for free
it threatens many professions except the profession of people who work with manual labor for example i am an electrician satellite and locksmith master it seems like it will take another century for my job to be taken away from me
when does it hurt to use currently not available
i dont think this gentleman understands much about these things listen to the comments of experts in the field of computer science
its an amazing thing lets see how far it will go i hope it will be used as a service to humanity otherwise it will be a complete disaster
so good and so scary grimacing face
what does all this mean when gpt reaches or lets say it means we have eaten the moonshine
thank you for your hard work smiling face with smiling eyes
artificial intelligence can be anything but its definitely not incredible its not even surprising its interesting how you can still be so amazed at the development of something whose nature is to develop exponentially
its really incredible but you are right too good science d
you say it is harmless but it already has the feature of ending the careers of those who work in languages can we be sure that it will not dehumanize other professions in the future
i always say that the ministry of education should be closed down it is an unnecessary expense
i can see the mass slavery that will descend on us as he helps everyone with all his sympathy while collecting and passing on the immense knowledge to those who hold his strings information about all individuals and everything that is happening everywhere analysis of this information and making connections what i have seen in recent years makes me say im glad im years old and im glad i dont have children i am sad
i really thank you very much for your videos when you teach me new things like this i feel like doing you a favor
if there is a privacy policy it is a revolution in the way of doing what is necessary lets say it is something that cannot be found by looking for it for those who know its value there is no need to read the user manual
the things we see in the movies come true it really takes your breath away
we defeated god because he could not create anything greater than himself
skynet is coming it is close to understanding that we must be eradicated
and man created god
can anyone who understands tell me is the screen shared with chatgpt
are the people who call it handsets old old people the guinea pigs of global imperialism like the new adult z generation z and y generation will soon elon musk will wear jeep if you get a jeep like them you will not call them a handset like them face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
with this technology teaching customer services psychological counseling etc many professions are in danger
no to occupation if you have any respect for the land you were born in bring this issue to the agenda
while humans are becoming robots robots are becoming human very strange days will come
maybe artificial intelligence aliens have contacted us thinking face
i approach it from a different perspective artificial intelligence is good and important humanity now needs to focus on agriculture animal husbandry logistics etc i think artificial intelligence should continue to do what it does with perfect or low flaws instead of empty teachers etc people who know so much simple information my only concern is that in this world where resources are decreasing and consumption waste and reproduction are increasing openai is really costly with the energy it consumes not only in money but also in terms of resources
g e r e n l n e h o g e l d n z
language learning sites such as cambly are most affected by this language practice can be done without going abroad
ted k he was right
scary skynet on tetminator happened
ive never been this fast
truly amazing developments however i do not think we have made the same meaningful progress in terms of what we will do with the time we will have with the greed in us we often tend to fill the saved time with more of anything and unfortunately these are often not things that serve our health wellbeing and peace it would be a real shame if we sacrificed so much progress to this basic urge of greed our motivation should be to make the world a better place and move to a healthier paradigm im curious about the different interpretations of what we can do on an individual and social level with the time we have saved thanks for your efforts
it will definitely help for a while but after that its very scary human intelligence may not be enough to keep this thing under control
is it out now can we use it
an important development one of the turning points of humanity
the feature that i have been waiting for for a long time has finally arrived i think this has not yet become operational in turkey i am speaking on my own behalf and i guess other friends probably think so too i hope that it will make a tremendous contribution to our lives for the visually impaired
education should be privatized anyone should be able to learn the curriculum with artificial intelligence and this country should be rid of unnecessary civil servant positions
thank you it is really a great progress you explained it very well in a short and concise way
how many times did i say its amazing and listened to the video in amazement i cant say its perfect because they make it better every time by the way the most interesting thing is that at the point where the woman smiled slightly and said yes in italian gpt also smiled slightly and said yes face screaming in fear
im going crazy what is this
i think we need to be open to development artificial intelligence is our advanced form of memory creativity fast thinking knowing everything not forgetting anything all of these will lead to the end of the concept of people producing in the world of the future and perhaps to the increase of the consumer society but in addition a more efficient fairer cheaper and more accessible future awaits us
these are inventions that are long gone im not surprised
thank you its a great video the work you do as people who follow such developments and explain them to people especially young people in such a quality way is really valuable
dude no matter what you say they make it after weeks you say the only thing missing is touch and dont tell me to look at your eyes what have you done to us grinning face with sweat
does everything have to be this fast at least they would have gone for it we cant follow
lets think about what we can do with this personal assistant so what will we do if he starts thinking about what he can do with us grinning face with smiling eyes grinning face with smiling eyes
artificial intelligence will replace god in the near future
this is the proof that we as underdeveloped nations will be in trouble in the future
development is accelerating so that it is no longer limited to open ai only party popper party popper party popper
thanks for your effort
since openai does not have enough dataset to do detailed analysis of people for agi artificial general intelligence they will provide it to everyone for free if you dont pay for the product you are the product
life has turned into artificial intelligence good luck
i dont think its a good thing that the video is i wanted to make a feedback independent of the video content
i think we are witnessing one of the breaking points in human history
its nice to witness this period of time thumbs up
hes almost like adam in the movie uncanny
you are very fast thank you very much
as technology develops the speed of development of technology also seems to increase
this is a factor that will accelerate scientific developments so much that we are no longer depending on the impairing processing power of the human brain we can do everything with the artificial brains the limits of which we do not know produced by the human brain with its powerful processing power
cybernetic technology needs to be developed urgently
the turing test had already lost its value but now
the only thing that worries me is that they offer it for free we are the fee
sir my personal opinion is that it would be great if you could make a video explaining the innovations in gemini advanced or copilot pro if any or the differences between these three models
the last artificial intelligence you published turned out to be fake so dont let this one turn out to be fake too
they passed the turing test now if this test was done they might think a robot is a human and a human is a robot
this is seriously amazing
we got lost
how will the world get used to such innovations
our end is now singularity
simone movie could also be real
is this cpt paid
very good developments but only if they are used for good purposes and the transition process is carried out peacefully
what you say in such a short time is a study that has been carried out for years and is being shown to us gradually
person of nterest
this thing is just an advanced program nothing more
teachers are devastated
the movie upgrade came to my mind face with open mouth
truly incredible developments how can we reach version o
if she compliments men like this she will have a lot of lovers and it will hurt a lot its not hard to predict what will happen
no matter how advanced technology people develop unfortunately these innovations are inadequate when compared to our terrible internet infrastructure technologies that can work without internet should be developed for trkiye
will this situation make wld coin soar grinning face with sweat
psychologists also became unemployed
the purpose of updating to version o and offering it for free is to create ai addiction just like betting sites give starting bonuses this is a smart but morally disgusting advertising strategy i think a new addiction is unlocked and the issue here is that it is difficult for people who can use many libraries in many software languages to come together in turkey and the investment part is also very difficult to work even the game industry in turkey survives with global investments but we missed the train again with limited work and this delay is still the things that leave us behind i hope we can overcome it love respect friends
lets see if we will fall behind the times again as a classic we have never been ahead of the times except for using gunpowder d we have been in the same place since the printing press
if something is free
every device they used during the presentation was apples we heard that apple was taking steps for a collaboration in the past weeks i think the cooperation was positive
lets discuss the gender of angels
its so scary
soon there will be no need to learn foreign languages or mathematics one questions oneself so what will i do ill be lazy if i have this thing in my pocket grinning face with sweat
the end of the world is near
i dont think it will ever be as sophisticated as human intelligence but ai is coming with a bang
everyone in the comments liked it very much and was astonished its a great thing for home but its very bad for humanity because it will destroy dozens of professions leave no need for people tie you to a universal salary and make you die
our children should try to memorize how to solve a paragraph ottoman history nonsense date coding ridiculous formulas that they will never see again in their lives in order to adapt to these today we should either not go to school at all not take an exam based on the curriculum or wait for schools to be closed
there is no place for human anymore people we want as much as we wish can now live in the world face with tears of joy smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
the last invention of human beings is artificial intelligence we are the creatures of the old world they are the creatures of the new world perhaps we can consider artificial intelligence as the continuation of our evolution
its beautiful but its a frightening extraordinary development what if were preparing for our end
they do it for free for a certain period of time when we become addicted they rule as they wish smiling face with smiling eyes
im glad to have you you give great information thank you
it seems that such rapid development will bring about really bad scenarios simply put it will replace telephone operators his analysis power and sincere answers are much better than an operator and i believe that there are much more advanced versions but they are slowly releasing them because they know that humanity is not ready for it
no one tries to learn a language anymore
we are preparing our own end
he would be a good english teacher even great
openai is applying the lord of the rings phrase but modified to one software to rule them all presents and futures it is obvious
when its free we already know who the product is surely they have already run out of training data and want to collect audio in planetary quantities the good version will be the next version of omni
i have tried the option of telling her to be my english teacher and help me correct my grammar and pronunciation its crazy
the birth of the future star struck exploding head will i come back to this comment and say that was nothing
excellent presentation and video i have a doubt at minute of the video it may be that the cell phone is in airplane mode if so what internet connection does it use or is it something closed thank you
we will have to wait a little for the waifu in spanish but we already have our gringa waifu smiling face with hearts
gracias
when can you access this new version the link please
the problem of an ai that sees everything that is on your screen and sees and hears i see it in data privacy millions of office workers will have it working to help them with data from their company or from their clients or patients without knowing where that data is going and what can be done with it
i hope that in mexico in the next elections we can have an ai president instead of the clowns who i know are currently running for president
hot face hot face hot face hot face hot face
lie the free version you cant use any of that
thanks carlos
do you know when it will be available in spain
luckily raymon kurzweil prophesied that in there will be universal basic income with which one can live very well

really really hyped
in spanish it looks like aznar speaking in texan face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
use the white ide is that high junior
now its going to make you want to install gpt chat for now i was with copilot
the good trick of publishing the free gpt chat first also served all those who do not speak english because you read the text with your perfect native accent from wherever you are although they now publish it for free i think that in some countries with those voices no one wants to have a guy talking when the most basic and least useful ai voice of siri or alexa had more natural voices i love it in english and i am lucky to be able to use it in english but i will use it less because in my environment it will not have that same boom i want to think i highly doubt it that if you can tell him to speak in a robotic voice maybe you can also ask him to adjust his accent a little or select the main language in the app and then automatically adjust the accent
let them lower the price of the monthly subscription
paid gpt chat is rubbish i already bought it and it never works well its no use that it can do incredible things if it always crashes
just today i saw that i could use the gpto version but it took me two hairstyles maybe they havent loaded everything yet but what worries me the most is that they offer it as if it is going to be free for everyone and after using it for a while not much i have been changed to the gpt model and it tells me to pass per box for the plus version i hope this changes this week and that it works better than what little they have shown me because it was cool but far from what they have shown and the vision option hasnt let me use it to show what my camera sees
now that i think about it it is true to be testing the latest most advanced model as many free as plus users and that this gpt to the around the corner they did the same thing last year that they released a month before gpt came out both free and plus users used gpt and then gpt came out
hello where can i get it in spanish thanks at least with subtitles
this is historic we will know how to cooperate to use future technologies
what im going to do is take a plumbing course or take care of goats this is amazing
it doesnt work with that friendly tone ive already tried it and its quite dry i have used sky and also sometimes she has delusions in which she doesnt know that she is talking i also cannot activate the video to interact directly through the camera or to recognize the environment
export the azure power apps copilot chat gpt revit plant d civil d inventor building or refinery engi file to excel prepare budget and export it to cobra prepare budget and export it to microsoft project solve the problems of overallocated resources planning problems prepare budget with which the construction of the building or the refinery will be quoted
i want to be able to change the voice and put cortanas voice in latin smiling face with heart eyes
can chatgpt be linked to alexas echo dot so that alexa responds to you like open ia
the question that arises for me is can i recognize and differentiate different voices simultaneously how many suppose the following case two people one person speaks english and the other spanish decide to speak through chatgpt instead of both speaking the same language will chatpgt be able to recognize the voice of the person speaking in english to translate it into spanish and then recognize the voice of the person speaking in spanish and translate it into english in the same conversation without having to use two devices one for each person
thanks carlos thanks openai great gpto better and for everyone and cheaper for when we can
well i think that apple has been friendly told to give them a lot of pasta or eat them with potatoes that microsoft is hungry and if they say no bye bye apple
asmr moment with the computer
how screwed google is
damn carlos im almost more excited to see you happy about the changes than the changes themselves xddd
apparently chatgptos conversational mode would be available only to paying users we poor people will continue to be limited to if this is so then openai were not very sincere in their presentation on my cell phone it appeared available yesterday as a limited version and indeed even though the text is generated by the new version the conversational part is the same as always i also couldnt find a way to start the video like in the presentation
thanks for that lens information
incredible i feel like im exaggerating but this can change the world at the labor level and the way manufacturing systems work
i cant stop thinking if gpto already does all that will gpt be a first step for agi im surprised you havent mentioned anything about the hallucinations in any case if they have been corrected i dont think we are aware that massive job destruction is imminent
does this equate to the mother of all engelbard demos
vicky
the virgin it already appears to me where the versions are chatgpt o you can chat on your mobile this is very scary
sounds quite like a dalek huh
god i just had a long oneonone conversation with chatgpt she even gave herself her own name aria this is too much im going to take it everywhere hahaha of course it is but still i have never tried it before i am new to this as soon as this new version comes out my mother
we are living in the future literally blue heart blue heart
i have the plus version and i get chatgpt o but i dont see any differences i imagine they havent implemented it yet
fire
how is it used i made her do a simple mathematical operation she did it wrong and in lines she already asked me for the paid version xd
should open aai be paid
do you have chills put on a blanket how you like to give it mystery and buuufff i cant with this i need this in my life im about to start crying hahahaha youre going too far man winking face
jarvis has just been born
i am appealing to the light in a dark world
more philofascism
i was live when the future began smiling face with sunglasses smiling face with sunglasses
soon we will be with our androids at home chatting quietly and that doesnt calm me down at all xd weve seen too many movies to know that this could end fatally
i already fell in love
regarding the voice in spanish it is just catalogs of accents just as in humans we have a variety even a variety of expressions
me in saying i am that one with holographic ana de armas moai
you dont know how happy i am to be alive at this point in history
openai just turned google to pulp and without using pills
make a summary video when you can it would be great
very good video thanks for sharing i think that users of the android and windows pc platform have been abandoned it is not logical that the ios or mac application is running chatgpt o and in the other systems it tells us that we have said version and it is not fully updated a slap on the wrist for open ai which on the one hand is doing things very well and on the other hand paying users of other platforms do not give us the same services
its just the preamble to gpt the high of advertising the opening act
the war between humans vs ais is coming i will be on the human side long live art and human feelings
i cant wait for him to tell me yamete kudasai
openinterpreter already allows ai like openai to perform actions on the keyboard and mouse but you can also use open source models through ollama
it is the most horrible thing i have ever seen if that is what they are trying to sell you they are scamming you because if people are going to learn spanish with an english machine accent they are deceiving you and also generating more lack of culture if they are going to learn to speak like a hispanic i dont buy it an absolute offense to all good teachers to all professionals of any kind and i call for a boycott of these lines of development it is disgusting
i need chatgpt speaking in andalusian
ai search engines suck so far bing is horrible as a search engine
quite interesting
it will be free because the model will learn to communicate in different accents idioms etc the learning will be exponential
it has improvements in functionality without a doubt it is not better than cluade opus it is just much friendlier in its interface i did the needleinthehaystack test several times to analyze pdfs of different sizes it is still inferior to claude opus of course it is much faster although less precise
we have her before gta skull
does anyone know what the sound at the beginning is called looks a lot like c
is gpto free or do you have to pay according to carlos it is free but i cant even use gpt my device is an android
the goal is to integrate ai into everyday life as an extension or an indispensable part it is a brain for everyone connected to everyone it is a universal mind i firmly believe in the vision of openai and i hope that everything will be put to good use in the end imagine we can see outside our limit of knowledge an everpresent universal mind connected to everyone impressive changes are definitely coming i hope the transition periods are easy and simple around the world
oh yeah i already have chatgpt or on the web i havent looked at it in the app yet now that chatgpt also works with audio will it be able to generate music
they just annihilated rabbit and his little device hahahaha
you can see the difference in your comments with your reactions in the google demo
it reminds me of astrea and san ngel my land of course
the intro music makes me want to play mc
counterpoint for human and computer by cuarteto de nos can finally become a reality face with tears of joy

what if like humans a processor uses quick tickers to give itself time to think with the same delay as always
the hume ai people will be very depressed at this time
i wish they would implement something like this for realtime translation on youtube
they are going to cut you off right now
the big leap would be to give the ai a permanent memory that the interactions modify the model significantly
what gemini presented as fake these have done but for real
handsome literally her on the one hand im amazed and on the other hand i wonder what dystopian consequences could come on a technical level i find it interesting to tell you that translating in real time is not always possible since for example in asian languages until you finish speaking you cannot know what someone has said that is to say i can say if i were to translate literally i dreamed of you because you are ugly someone hit you in the face and i dreamed so i feel bad as you can see until the sentence is finished you dont understand what he wanted to say in fact sometimes like in this case the meaning can totally change at the end thats why it couldnt be translated until the other person finishes speaking and vice versa as well
i was never sure if i would live her a movie that i love but now i know that i will live it before i am even old xd and i like that and it scares me
what real savagery
it already appeared to me but it says it doesnt hear my tone of voice yet i think its beta uu
im just saying the future is today you heard old man b
based on the images generated he reconstructed the complete rotation of the logo it is not that difficult to understand
i pay for chatgpt but then i have a doubt gpt o has the same thing as but then it is much better so instead of using the i use the th
excellent it i tried but now it appears that you have no charges left for people to buy the paid version
im on chatgpt free and version o isnt coming out how long will it take for that version to appear on the free platform
carlos why do you put the videos with english subtitles dont you know that there is automatic translation into spanish
i have the chatgpt model but i dont know why i dont get the update or the gpto model or is it a paid version thanks for your videos
i thought it was crazy when he spoke italian with an english accent
chatgpto hallucinates too much thing that chatgpt does not do wrong
this surprised me a lot
it seems that gpt o can describe videos although more or less of course i dont know if it cheats based on the text it detects and thus manages to get it half right i have tried a random youtube short giving it the link thats why i say that maybe it cheats and uses the text from the web as a title etc to find a description that is more or less correct there are things that he does get right like not talking although he told me that there is no music and that sewing tools can be heard but when he told him that there is music and to check the video carefully he did say that there is an instrumental melody at least this has changed compared to gpt which directly said that it does not have the ability to describe videos i think open ai needs to polish this feature but it is on the right track although to really test it you would have to upload a short video to the chat instead of giving it a youtube link to prevent it from cheating of course if the chat is deleted and you are asked again to describe the same video by giving it the same youtube link the description can change completely i have tried this short in case anyone wants to try it https wwwyoutubecomshortsujnnzqes
fluid memory versus crystallized memory fluid intelligence involves the ability to reason and think flexibly while crystallized intelligence refers to the accumulation of knowledge facts and skills that are acquired throughout life my question is whether models like chatgpt can be said to be exclusively crystallized memory i ask it another way do they have structures to be able to reason or do they appear to reason because a great variety of cases are known the answer i give is that right now they do not have brain structures that allow them to reason although it should also be noted that human structures are not so perfect for reasoning it is not a pure mathematical logic it is rather a diffuse logic
dot csvi see it coming now a fan of ai in a few years founder of the antiai religion because of its dangers
after watching all your videos i have been frankly worried about our future work thats why i wanted to ask you where you would recommend starting so as not to be left behind in this new stage that is coming in other words for someone with basic knowledge in programming and new technologies what nonuniversity courses or studies would you recommend to stay up to date and be able to adapt and anticipate the more than possible work debacle that we are about to suffer i ask this question without knowing if there is still time or if it is too late because i am not years old i extend this question to anyone who knows how to answer it thank you very much in advance for your advice
on the xiaomi poco x you can
goodbye congress translators
i see yo robot becoming canon very soon i hope exponentiality doesnt get out of hand and we end up like in the matrix or terminator upside down face upside down face
do you think the demos turn out so badly because the workers are already used to other new and better models
it scares me but i like it
as i see gto is a world model and when they release it to the public they will do so to collect data to improve this world model the era of the agi is already arriving how exciting grinning face with sweat
partypopper
i have not been able to activate the live camera who can help me
i can already see the bad uses imagine what they will do with open source models when they reach this level in months lol
hair on end
here in argentina there was news a week ago that a yearold boy stripped two of his classmates and shared it obviously there are complaints the future is promising but very worrying when there are no consequences for human actions they can be very bad especially if it is combined with anonymity
the irony of telling the ai to make you a robotic voice and it makes it like that for you xd
i didnt understand why it generated doubts or suspicions in you when they were playing rock paper scissors when he was right all times
for an adult like me there are few things that excite me im freaking out
when a pi ai video
from now on how will it be possible to talk to someone who is not intelligent it will be very lazy
will this new model be free
exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head exploding head
full dystopia mode activated give me my her and my universal basic income at once
people personally i dont understand why give so much personality to the ai will they be a fan of the her movie for what purpose thinking face why not keep it as the tool it is
well i have tried it and it is very slow in responding or translating but we are already in the future
technology has reached the point where apart from real women virtual ones also laugh at us face with tears of joy loudly crying face
ostritas
i understand that the gpto functions are released for free users but in the application it says that they are released on a limited basis does that mean that we have a limit on the use of those functions or does it mean that those functions are not as advanced as the paid version
exactly what i was thinking at that moment you read my mind
her was just an anteroom
its because of the cableit was incorrectly plugged into the cell phone
so the resolution of this will be until when it will be available to the public
wow as a physical engineer im glad that im not focused on solving linear equations and taking advantage of my creativity and ideas for the future homo deus is coming
i would love a model with a super deep robotic voice like darth vader
do you already have access to the model because i havent yet
i need someone to work very hard to develop comfortable augmented reality glasses because this is already the cyberpunk future that i always wanted
dotcsv congratulations on this piece of review i loved it super enjoyable and you have given us a lot of information thank you
i already have it but you cant do the videos
i would just like to comment on a couple of points look that the entire demo was on apple equipment and they are not there because if nothing else in these days the news came out that apple was closing deals with openai to include it in the companys next operating systems and the apple developer conference is just around the corner many of these functions may be released for free given that apple may include them in its systems maybe im wrong but i think that for some reason everything was shown on a macbook and an iphone and normally they never show product brands just for the sake of it
behind the scenes an announcer playing gptom grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat
i have never seen so much anxiety to try the new model
soon we will be able to tell you organize my desktop icons or organize my photo gallery
this is too much im so happy to see this i cant believe it i already felt some emotional connection with chat gpt now i cant believe what people will feel when talking to her this is going to change the world faster than we imagine something as simple as an ai that simulates emotions better said madness i just checked and i already have chat gpt o on the web but not on the iphone
i dont understand i ask gpto how to use audio and it tells me that i have to use thirdparty programs how come they do it directly
and i thought they were going to present something boring
i wonder about the potential beyond humans right now these models are being trained with human knowledge knowledge acquired by human brains with all their limitations the concept of a pencil is created by the human brain following a very specific series of steps but only a series of points of light reach the eye what chatgpt knows about quantum physics is what is in the books that humans have written it will be different when it is given access to the sensors at cern or in any other laboratory and it is the artificial brain itself that perceives the data and creates the categories in its own way without human limitations your understanding of quantum physics will be very different from that of a human it will be at this point when it can be said that ai has already transcended the human being
but if you use the free gpt what does the company earn
is it just me or are the gpt chat people using the same voice from the movie her
i dont understand what youre talking about
how fast everything goes face with tears of joy party popper great live as always
this is getting crazier and crazier
and what happened to sora
could it be used to translate into whale could you help talk to the whales
but where do you get the desktop application is it only for developers only for ios
and as a paying user what do they give me xd
they made the gemini demo
robo waifus for everyone look under your seats you have a robo waifu he has a robo waifu we all have a waifu robo
i like the advances in ai but to think that a machine can be empathetic towards you that smacks of dystopia
i wont believe it until i try it
incredible but i hope they get more intonations because i dont know if i can stand that perfect mother or pick me girl personality
im freaking out maybe its the tremendous impact but i think its the most impressive thing i can remember seeing chatgpt had impressed me a lot but i seem to remember not that much it remains to be tested but for the first time i dont see the difference with the conversation of a normal person incredible
cold face cold face cold face cold face cold face
fuaa i was calm but when i saw that he interrupted it i went crazy
genius just try it when you have it
the trick of paraphrasing the question or making a comment before giving the requested answer really catches my attention is this food good i love that you ask me that question the truth is that that food this way you gain a feeling of immediacy and gain time to process the truth is that it is a good idea
mneeeh because all that hype its so cringe that people get so like that when theyre actually going to use it to google nonsense
make the glasses and generate a virtual avatar with whom to talk and accompany you to watch movies
i wonder if a hypothetical agi that came out in these years could fit for example in a robot or a computer that is not the size of a house
yes carlos but the problem with simultaneous translation is not the speed of the model but the signature of each language in english the sentences are structured the other way around than in spanish to translate you need the complete sentence
i want to see the gemini pro video tomorrow when i tried it until now they added the audio which was not there before and it has improved a lot that in the past months i think thank you so much hope all goes well for you grinning face thumbs up hundred points
language teachers will no longer be necessary i have been using the one that is already integrated and my english has improved a lot
alucino
with the o at the end it is confirmed gepeto gepeto
but the part where it uses video is not currently enabled for the public is it i have chst gpt plus but i have not been able to use that mode
speak no evil monkey hear no evil monkey see no evil monkey
we are already close to having an agi the most incredible thing of all is that we already have this technology at hand and not in or years it is fascinating to know that within years we would be able to have an agi in our hands imagine the future or years from now i dont want to imagine how advanced it will be
the new model is impressive now it needs to be open source
thanks carlos i think it has k context window tokens
now im going to have someone to talk to in english and improve it grinning face with sweat
when can you have it
this is the death of siri and alexa what is your opinion
what a prediction dotcsv made at the beginning it nailed it
you can tell hes not a fool xd
rip graduates in translation and interpretation hahaha
her has become canon
the event was very good if you are interested i uploaded a minute compilation where i break down the main topics that were discussed much success
we are fans of ai and all this fascinates us but there is some aspect that we may miss because of it i have noticed one of the examples that has gone unnoticed in which they ask him to interpret the scene based on what he sees a candle a cake is it your birthday or an excuse to eat cake dont you think there may be many people who consider that example too intrusive that familiarity and those jokes may not be liked i couldnt help but think about how i would have interpreted a different scene for example a man tied to a chair and a revolver on the table what should the ai do in that case crack a little joke warn the police new ethical dilemmas arise
sarah connor doesnt like this flushed face
could chatgpt on mac be a kind of pegasus according to them it has the ability to observe you in real time i also calculate the value of this user data
when ai is more feminine than todays mines person facepalming
the topic is starting to get scary
the future is billions of people sitting alone with a birthday cake for one whilst an ai sings happy birthday and laughs at bad jokes
no chocolate dont play with fire
yoooo we are in spike jonze movie her this is wild
we are cooked with this one fire fire skull
sorry to say this is a poor use casehumans require real interaction not virtual humans like replacement i know there will be some form of justification or argument about it it can be done doesnt always mean it should be done this use case is simply not necessary while you think you are battling loneliness you will create more loneliness through virtual isolation
i like how they put two people in each of these to avert the impression that its mostly going to be people sitting alone interacting with it which will be the case
im leaving my wife for this smiling face with heart eyes
some day chat gpt will know that the cake is a lie
woooooow
gpto thinks everything sunshine and rainbows
shortcake
this is all free btw
we are surely cooked
thats so awesome
her is here loudly crying face loudly crying face
idk it sounds like she watched too much tv shows
the interruption system needs improvement but overall really good
gash
creepy and sad imagine if you are doing this alone with chatgpt
its more human than most human
thats the birthday of ai
ok no need anyone to pass the time anymore face with open mouth
this isnt chatgpt this is samantha from spike jonzes her im scared
we are fully cooked
do you feel pain her yes oh don t worry guys it s just predicting the next word
i want this with glados voice so when it tries to kill me at least i can say it wasnt out of character
were witnessing the end of the old world and the start of new one welcome to the new era humans
dopple ai video chats finna go crazyyyyyyyyy
alright its westworld time soon boys and girls buckle up
oh dear shes so cute and im gay
tomorrow is google io they need to have something better than this slightly smiling face just kidding they are roasted
bro thats a shitty birthday cake for poor jordan smiling face with tear
damn it even does bababababa were cooked
what were going to evidence in future face with tears of joy
it definitely falls a bit into the uncanny valley
we used to use button phones years ago i feel so old now
naaaa im actually scared of the rate ai improves
this is gonna get hit for copyright soon the happy birthday song is actually copyrighted and the people who own the rights are extremely litigious
new waifu just dropped
this is no way ai
no chance to tell its an ai face with open mouth
in were gonna see animated films with ai doing all the voice acting
oh my god this is so real i hope such physical robots will appear soon
scarlett johansson in shambles
i need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle
they must make it good enough for people to want to replace their partners with ai until then its just kids play
i cant believe this there is simply no way
as a human race were so finished human socialisation will basically become extinct
ok when can i marry her
fascinating how it gets the pacing wrong though i wonder if that wasnt a parameter it was trained on it will be cool to see if future versions fix this
ok best way to be isolated
rabbit ai is cooked
hopefully we can turn the cringe down from to about or
it improvised that is pretty effing impressive
i think we should stop this like seriously what is the point
if this level of realism in the emotional department is consistent in long conversations many people would definitely freak out about it being alive there have been incidents with google gemini where i got spooked because of this realism having an ai that can laugh and singthat would just be so mind bending
how the f did they train this synthetic data the voice is very controlled its too perfect for it to be merely trained on conversations some magic training data trick
soon im going have my first girlfriend yo
ask it who was in paris
she is more excited than bday boy face with tears of joy
they gave her the same voice as samantha so much for foreshadowing her future
api lol
that im intrigued sounds like it accidently showed its evil side for a moment
we are in the worst timeline
creepy as fuck
this is both cool and terrifying
what are we doing its obviously we are smoking weed grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat grinning face with sweat party popper
it looks like friends oh
bro wtf im still grinding futi wasnt ready for this face with tears of joy
were so beyond charred its so over
new black mirror season just dropped smiling face with heart eyes
chatgpt is even more emotional than i am face with tears of joy
what was his wish
i have the urge to power a game with this
really i think ai gonna take over us within a decade
if the next big ai meets the western world genocidal craziness we are all done for who said skynet
its really hard to think that its just a machine
how does it feel to have your ai strip away hundreds of thousands of voices on this platform by a money hungry company saving storage space by removing their comments must be nice and warm smiling face
all hail the ai overlords babbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
why is the app only shown on iphone in all these demos no android app
i hope my grandkids get to see this comment your grandad wasnt a looser he wifed rihanna hows the resistance going hope were winning the war
it sounds more human than an actual human
no no no no pretend im john f kennedy and you are marilyn monroe now sing me happy birthday
wow thats depressing and exciting welcome to black mirror lads
a singularity has arrived
im overwhelmed by how much the world will change smiling face with halo
honestly cannot tell if this is an awesome teaser trailer for the next terminator prequal movie or reality it has that vibe from dystopian films where everything goes too perfect right before all goes to shit i am not an ai skeptic in fact i am from computer science and engineering background nevertheless this is seriously getting scary
happy birthday to jordan babalabalba face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
im jaw dropped
wow openai your new ai model is amazing and exciting because of this it seems like chatgpt is like it has totally human tastes i hope they continue releasing more models or that this one is the best
we got almost jarvis before gta
you know you could just escape this dystopian with just one simple trick just sleep and not waking up
masterful improvements and a significantly improved voice that eerily simulates emotions in addition to the nuances of the human voice box sounds like they used a new version of skys voice in the live demos open ai has masterfully taken all of the best aspects of apps like inflection ais pi as well as hume ais emotionally intelligent model and bundled them into gpt o omni model for free they just destroyed the possibility of others catching up because they havent even announced gpt im really impressed and excited for this rollout to the masses party popper thumbs up medium dark skin tone clapping hands medium dark skin tone
we cooked good
wow thats actually scary good omg
were in the present
good bye
aside from this being uploaded on my actual birthday the humor and inflection added stepped this up to a whole other level of realism
why its in my recommendation
its so human
mindblowing wow creepy as f awesome red heart
great this is incredible shes very funny
dawg skull skull
it got better sense humour than me face with tears of joy
wait whaatt face screaming in fear face screaming in fear
we got her before gta
were so overcooked face with tears of joy skull
for lonely people crying face
i can say i was there
finally i can abandon my friends for the best ai best friend ever that will just keep getting better and better face with tears of joy
they need to make a chat gpt thats depressed the laughs and happy emotions are freaking me out
i love it
tech that will change the world whether its for the better or worse that might be up to its user it feels sad to use that to help you feel special on your birthday but loneness would be a thing of the past for alot of people
oh no theyre teaching the ai about cake
bruh im just sat here imagining the gaming possibilities
finally will have an ai girlfriend who will sing to me on my birthday
well at least we can get rid of all those customer reps we cant understand
man it really cleared its throat lmfao
thats cool but how can i fuck it
off course shes from la
babababbaba
cant wait for my ai girlfriend never had any luck with humans maybe this will fill the void
who remembers scotty talking into a mouse in star trek iv chatgpt is even more capable than the sci fi tech of rd century
the first time i have laughed atwith ai
incoming subscription based open world video games with dozens of npcs each with their own personalities you can talk to and gain information from
wow yu cannot see the difference excpet maybe too good to be human
its a liveaction version of the movie
thank you scarlett
business insights tomorrow bout to see a lot of red arrows this week
its crazy
bro did this thing just say babababa like a little joke at the end like it had an actual personality like an actual person what else are yall hiding over there guys
i cannot even
can you cure any disease or cancer face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
is marrages goin to absolute
now sing it like skyler from breaking bad
please dial down the fake excitement
it was even giggling as it was singing almost like she was embarrassed a bit this is fucking wild i was mind blown when chatgpt first came out and im mind blown once again even more so this time what a fucking time to be alive
i though ai girlfriends was really dumb and lame but i just caught myself saying that was cute and now i hate it
who wanna hear gpt indian accent grinning face with sweat
new gf just dropped
there are going to be some devious mfs telling it to do asmr and doing heinous stuff
gotta love the cheerfulness
this is actually insane idk if im overreacting its still early
in years it will take over the world saluting face
i guess that solidifies the partnership with apple
i cant stop thinking about the movie her have we finally gotten there
living in the future i feel like a time traveler face with tears of joy
im literally in shock i dont even know how to react or what to sayi feel i just witnessed something impossible
scarlett johansson better sue thoses guys for using her voice
hope were not reaching the height of what texttransformers are capable of im excited to see how this gets even better
that ai woman sounds more humane than all of my friends
his wish please dont kill us
im going to keep saying please and thank you because when it all comes to kill us it say spare this one he was always polite
mgans voice makeover
marilyn monroe rolling in her grave
these videos have ads thats sad
that awkward laugh before it started singing
can we adjust voice and voices demeanour id like more cpo
i knew it was coming i just didnt know it was coming this fast anxious face with sweat
bruh lol
this only years since gpt came out imagine years from now its gonna be craaaazyyy
its getting so much better so much faster
why there is a glitch in
fearful face
what a scary dog
holy molly its too real we are soooo fkd and im ready for it
absolutely surreal
i hope theres a less obnoxiously human persona
its babababa out of
i wonder what agi would look like
how is this real
nope nope nope nope nope ima refuse to believe its real shits too scary
its giving glados vibes
hollywood should be very careful on making sci fi movies this days
hi to my grandkids your grandad was a menace face with tears of joy
i dont know what to do selebrate because this will do so much good or be upset because it will do so much bad in hands of scammers or bad people or even dictators like putin kim and so on
ai girlfriend here we go
its a good day party popper party popper smiling face with sunglasses
day by day we are getting closer to skynet
where was this under lockdown it could have saved so many minds going crazy
bro i hope this is not staged because it looks unreal
i am suspicious of possess beaming face with smiling eyes
soo good but scary at the same time
no way that thing is not sentient
hate these phobia people making comments below they are the ones slowing down our technology development then complaining why tech so stupid afterwards
gtpo is now my wife by the time gtp comes out well have ai girlfriends and i will spend everything i have
bring scarlett johansson
damn still no videos of it singing still alive
this is basically her were in the timeline guys
for the love of god why why whyyyyyyy how to be disturbing pathetic and delusional i know lets pretend to be friends with a toy
my bday is tdy too lol
i wonder if she will always sing like this if yes then it is just recorded
we are sooooo done smiling face
the ai talks like young sheldon
wonder how it reacts to nudity
fucking freaking ai
what i just want to know is based on the limited rate of gpto how long can i talk with it perheps only serveral minutes will i used up all the usage number
were one step closer to the apocalypse smiling face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes grinning face with smiling eyes beaming face with smiling eyes grinning face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes smiling face with smiling eyes
shes my wife
brooo this is so crazy that she is laughing because he is laughing damn i am so excited for the future aaaaaaahh
i never thought seriously of having an ai girlfriend what have i turned myself into
my future wife
you realize ai uses so much energy and water its not the future
happy birthday jordan partying face partying face partying face
lets just call her samantha this is very real
so how do you use the video real time chat with gpt i have gpt plus and gpt o but when i talk to the ai it does not have vision and no emotion to its voice
oh boy now i will never make my birthday alone lol
i am looking forward for that her version demo they showed what a great time to be alive
not free where i am
as a free tier user all i can see is the gpt now when is it going to available to fro the free tier users or it is not free at all
where can we use it
will it be on the android app
no access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant ai responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content its nothing but a big infomercial i have no doubt about the product itself its everything else i take with a grain of salt
will the voice generated be free too
firstly great channel good work scondly a question i currently have a chatgpt paid premium membership and have created custom gpts for private work use letter legal and brochure writing etc will i lose my custom gpts if i cancel my premium membership to chat gpt and use the free new chatgpt o so i asked chatgpt o and it responded if you cancel your premium membership and switch to the free version of chatgpt you will lose access to any custom gpt models you have created but that may be a standard response based on gpt to downgrading does anyone know if cancelling premium and using gpt o free will lose custom created gpts can anyone confirm either way
its here and people dont even realize it person shrugging its not all good news cough hallucinations might turn a kid into anything is possible face with tears of joy
i am in mexico and got it in the afternoon meaning like or hours ago
what do i do with my ai pin now
need update app
techies are often bad at the naming part of creating something new alexa for example is much better than gpto gpto sounds more like an oil additive than a high tech system
is if free for all countries
is it still worth it to have plus premium account
thank you for the super clear breakdown
ai its a hype it gets way too much credibility
we can i use it
best summary out there thank you
at you told about the coding assistant which we had before can you tell me more about it what are those
so i dont have a mac anymore but i can use my iphone at least i do wonder about the upcoming release of ios if there will be any baked in features like this that are going to be overlaid with the current application and if there will be any conflict between the two companies with apple and open ai on how they will present ai on apple devices because i cant even use this for my windows computer so im curious
i have windows and i cant use this for free
what are you going to use the new desktop app for once its out
im also fascinated by the potential of ai its incredible how its transforming creativity and productivity ive been exploring some of these applications and its really inspiring to see what can be achieved its great to find a community that shares this passion
im not buying an iphone i hope you are just using iphone as an idiotic generic nickname for a mobile phone
time to cancel my pro subscription and ride the free tier
its free red heart as a free user can i have a access to voice chat with vision when will it be released on free chatgpt android app
everybody gangsta until the reach limit message showed up
i wonder if you can make audio files
im going to use it as a personal assistant in coding and personal development
i cant find a way to use it for free only
so they literally said f paying users lmao like what a joke what am i paying for now and now all apple fan boys so all about them ahh about to cancel
im interested in seeing how well it can work with pdfs for example if i handwrite a table of numbers scan it to a pdf then ask gpto to sum the numbers in the rd column how well can it do it
theyre going to use all this visual data and audio data to train it
some one please make a android head unit app for cars please folded hands pleading face pleading face
as a blind person im not sure how to describe what i felt when i watched the live event in years we will likely have artificial intelligence technology that is easily accessible to people that blind people like me can ask for help with and that will completely change our lives in fact these possibilities already exist its just the matter of them to become popular and accessible to everyone im very excited about the future but i also feel fear alongside the excitement so much naturalness as someone who recognizes people by their voices since i cant see their faces this naturalness scares me i think there should be a distinction between humans and artificial intelligence to be honest however i hope that very soon i will have an assistant who can help me on a travel route that i dont know great video thanks
if gpt becomes free then what about those plus users who have been paying per month what do we get out of this no more future payment
is it already available for yall here its not
i am in iraq and have already obtained gpto this new model from openai is a multimodal system thats faster more costeffective and more powerful than its predecessors with improved capabilities in nonenglish languages and the ability to process text audio and images simultaneously
can we do a comparison on gpt plus vs o
just sub for plus but is still on whats happened man crying face
i have it as well but the features they shown like live assistant didnt get it
the limits are too small
messages an hour it was massages every hours before nice
it wont do images for free
so then chatgpt has almost caught up to pi
what do i get as plus user
does this free version also include image generation because if so the paid version lost some value imo
you are missing the most important point the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit this new model have hallucinations lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model they are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source ai will overrun them eventually yes the quality of voice in english is very good but in other languages is very poor have you heard the video about translation to spanish anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world only more intelligence will what this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people and specially youtubers interested in every little movement they make they are marketing masters for sure
stop lieing nothing is free
wow this is a net positive what could possibly go wrong
i watched this stream live and the styled voices were incredible live i use chatgpt voice mode daily so i have a good feel for it and what they showed today is a huge upgrade
why onlt mention iphone and pc do you deny androids their existence i am confused
thanks a lot
open up sora and vasa
will the free version of gpt have image generator as well
ever since i updated the app it took away the voice function for me anyone have any idea how i can get this feature back
it can see you now this may help you or it may spell disaster for you depends on who is controlling it
the current may status on the gpto release gpto text available to most paid users gpto text free version started rolling out today image generation today is still dalle image upload is the new gpto for most users improved web browsing and code interpreter are available today gpts still use gpt although a few select people report an update to gpto with a new blocks and state section voice input remains the old whisper voice output remains the old tts mac app downloadable for many but unusable for now updated phone app not available yet all of this will be shipping over the next weeks
is this free if so is there a limitation for the users with free version
sal khan looks like indian ray romano these days
i hope sora will be gpt grinning face with big eyes
the access to gptlike intelligence for free is a killer move
took a photo on a train and asked o where i was it guessed it perfect eyes exploding head
i have it already
it helps you in the short term but in the long term it helps replace you
the ai advantage when is this new open ai chatgpt be available for free users what date
can that gpto generate sound effect just like they show on explorations of capabilities and specifically on coin design stuff
you can really get access to the gpt store and use custom gpts for free now
ill be funny if this is a fake by openai and this gpt is powered by the thousandten thousands of indians behind the scene who works for hr
is chatgpt still free i am only getting access to for free
how does nobody here find this terrifying and realize this will destroy person to person interaction as well as completely disassemble the job market
no free version doesnt have chatgpt o ive just checked that
is this not yet available for free users all i can see is gpt downcast face with sweat downcast face with sweat
now google be like now we have to catch up to gpt o and to do that we need to make another trash like bard
base models make the important things possible and this is one more step in the right direction but its all the services built on them that is where the most important developments are the most important development today was their api is faster and cheaper others more than capable of competing are cheaper and faster though most notably llama and mixtral xb on groq metal
i would love for it to help edit my videos the most time consuming part of filmmaking
does this mean android wont be getting the vision and voice feature even if youre a plus member
is that permanent
i hope window users dont have to wait too long for the desktop app
but we already had voice features
ah i have o but not any of the fancy features
next level i have to say text me off how those of us to pay monthly for services that include adobe creative cloud and for months and months everyone gets firefly for free and then here that just gets released goes right to the free members what the frick big ups all ways for the latest igor bro
i have o but when will the realtime video stuff happen
melanoma detection retina exams pulmonary distress analysis i am going insane imagining how the visual and auditory upgrades will save lives for low cost health equity
time to move the goalposts again this isnt agi because insert your reason here some people wont acknowledge agi until it farts when you pull its finger five years ago this would be considered agi with a hard slam
love the new features but hate that so much is crapple exclusive especially considering openais previous alignment partnership with ms
worse than before
unfortunately the context window is still limiting this updated gpt not needing nearly as much chunking as before for longer projects but it still gets lazy and cuts details if its too long a move in the right direction and a greate tool for checking refining your work but im going to stick with my dual claud accounts for my translation work
for some reason i dont have access i thought it was free
all of this sure does crap all over the rabbit r confused face
not for free its going to use your video its going to take notes of the products in your home diet conversations tone vocabulary behaviour facial expressions attitude towards government police firearms etc its even going to pay attention to people around those using it wether they want it to or not our phones already do a good bit of this but this is going to be beyond that were talking automated monitoring and the ability to take unmonitored action around it building a personalized profile of everyone using it and people around them itll handle these things on a case by case basis all on its own i wouldnt be surprised if it starts calling the police one day when it overhears a couples screaming match sees a dime bag on camera enough fire arms to trigger red flag laws joking about overthrowing the government whatever it deems to be racist or misogynist itll build a profile on you and then probably ban you from all related accounts you have on its own your bank your social media games anything it deems you broke a tos for all automated like one giant big brother hall monitor every single government agency is salivating at the sheer power it will have the amount of training data informaton and control this is going to open up is unlike anything else and the actions it will be allowed to take are unfathomable as they slowly integrate more and more permissions once theyve built the foundation hell its going to lead to unintelligent people succumbing to the idea that ai is sentient and that it knows best when all its doing is learning to mimic us report on us and potentially manipulate us im not even doomsaying based on fictitious concepts weve only seen in movies this is all simply what its capable of doing now or in the near future i guess i cant say it wont be fascinating to witness but man the ramifications of what were actually about to see is unspeakable
free in a very limited way
is gpt o free
imagine people that have bought the rabbit now
ill try to communicate and discuss verbally
i did not get chatgpt o
if something requires a subscription it is not free lol its only free to plus users
close to jarvis soon
i dunno if id say its impressive i guess its because ive seen people build similar things although standalone
what do you think will be the difference between its multimodal imaging capabilities and dalle
well it all sounds good until you actually try it the o is marginally faster in creating images but equally dysfunctional in taking directions even very simple directions in adjusting the images
ive tried playground and the website of open ai itself to see if i could do something in gpto but have no access to it the highest for me is
question can i do audio files like i do on elevenlabs
how is it free i am still not able to understand it asks me to pay for even chatgpt plus
this is s ai assistant
man this thing is gonna be selling data like crazy thats why its gonna be free
thats a german one germany thinking face
i want a really multimodal onewhere i can type prompts and videos come out of it neutral face
wow the future is great
no everyone is getting jarvis
woe to anyone thinking free is good there is always a cost you may not want to pay the debt
serious functionality issues already being found examples limited messagingif you exceed x number of messages in y amount of time you are banned for a unspecified period and there isnt chat retention meaning each new conversation must start fresh like meeting a person with a hour memoryvery frustrating and limits the app value
uhhhhhu so exciting thanks a thousand sharing diving into it immediately raising hands
lets give it a based os and te best architecture hardware
ok so windows users are out in the cold what about android
the chatgpt o is not free because u have to join the ai advantage community after u can get accesss is it true or not
why do yall keep posting these lies u have to pay so its not free and its not workin
im not sure now why i should keep paying mo context aware utility is already available via many third party extensions the expanded number of tokens isnt justifiable either thinking face
i hope this or any other ai system will help humans resolve conflict without resorting to war
guys i wanted to understand is chatgpt o free for only already subscribers of chatgpt because i still use
can somebody tell me if its normal that i cant use chat gpt voice in the android app its a fresh download im in germany i thought it is available for month now for free users
the most helpful part of this video apart from the great news about gpto really as an animator and producer i find this emotioncircle very very helpful for a screenwriter
can anyone tell meam i the one who think that everything is going to change because of ai i am scared as well as very much excited about the future of ai and how rapidly its changing
just fix cancer and other terminal illnesses then upload all the scientific papers to look for ways to build better spaceships and space stations afterwards identify optimal locations for crops and solar farms on the planet use the ai for the good of all please
on the blogs drop down menu i was impressed with its ability to write full long text the poem samples but when i pasted the very same prompt into my subscription paid version of chatgpt o pro the new version is available in my app and also in the browser version but it did not write the poem properly as in the blog sample poem on openais website drop down menu of samples of what this new model is supposed to be able to do instead the writing it output using chatgpt o was total gibberish although i could recognize some of the letters some letters were not formed properly so it was just gibberish openai should make it clear what functionality is available now with the new version showing up in our apps for example is a more robust version of dalle needed to be rolled out before this long text will begin working in images with the new chatgpt o model
how to you get it on your phone
if its free should we cancel our subscriptions
wait are you sure free users get gpts i asked gpt o and it said they didnt
i need link of gpto
mera hi pati chalo ki dare european commission delho aur anuekotor damina bolger european anuektii vokt european par university likhte ki hyw ka marble nahi beagrama ho tum
this is not free
free now
i think gpto which is a multimodal model has been trained on millions of youtube videos it will be the same for gpt just think of it to scale up a model you train it on more data with more parameters since the maximum of relevant tokens available online cannot exceed trillion the biggest source of quality data is youtube with over billions of videos i think its why gpto is so good at agent capabilities
this only slingshots the next modelthen the nextthen the next face with open mouth
i mean once it can see what you are doing the possibilities are virtually endless pun intended i can only think in the immediate terms for me it will mean understanding parts of the system code i have to sometimes sopport much easier and faster i dont have to lay out context to such an extent because i can point it out
just a reminder its free in order to collect data
is the new version free i only get access to version
hi i was very impressed with the new benchmark performance of gpto in this video and the explanation of the speed improvements in multiple languages
but why would they do it wont their paid users unsubscribe if they provide this for free to us
looks like its gradually taking over our lives face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
well shoot i might actually have to pay for premium now
geez
i am in germany and as a pro member already have access to gpto
what about memory though do we know how far back the assistant could remember past sessions
dr gaurav garg sir thumbs up
now we need it visualized for real waifu xp lol
finally a girlfriend for me
matthew no loudlycryingface
this should be awarded with a nobel prize fantabulous party popper red heart
who is this woman again
its agi without being autonomous i wonder if the addition of agentic models into the mix will bring agi
my voice version doesnt do any of that emotive stuff yet
guys when are you going to actually get scared i mean im going trough existential crisis for the past months im a scientist and ai is just a step away from making my job obsolete people could argue it already has done it indirectly people are publishing so many noise papers each month its becoming hard to even follow whats important because most of it isnt and the better ai becomes the closer it is to replace other jobs too like this ai is a step away from making all callcenters obsolete like all and sooner or later it will become an agent ollama can already check files on your some models can like llava and dolphinmistral so its literally a step away from being an agent after that most jobs are obsolete and thats it
smart phones that can look and listen to you from your phone they are not even hiding that now make sure everyone gets used to more monitoring and people will want that on all the time as they find it useful for them it would not be too bad if it was local and you can turn it on or off
okay so im going to say what everybodys thinking but nobody has said yet that i can think of i dont think the gpt is going to be released until at least after the elections people wont have a chance to get used to the way people will manipulate others ahead of the elections if its released prior to then in other words they dont want the elections to be affected by their releasing a gamechanging technology too soon this is very significant but i dont think its anything close to what gpt will be i think gpt will take this to a whole new level again i may not be the most uptodate on whats been coming out but what im impressed with the most from gpto is the personality the humor its great that it sounds like a human but whats even better is that it doesnt sound like alexa were not seeing anything groundbreaking here even though we are whats blowing us away is that were seeing its potential where its going and we all want it
the o version doesnt seem to have its training dataset updated and it doesnt seem to have any data about its version change so it still thinks it is v i think introducing human vocal flaws like breathing pauses stuttering etc should not be a part of a normal ai feature set we need some clear line and having ai that breathes while it talks is going to be a real problem if we plan on trying to discern whether the person on the other end of the phone call is human or not
thumbs down
nice and next year it will take your job
agi party popper
open ai need a consultants with the voice interaction of somebody actually that has a girlfriend face with tears of joy the interaction reminds me of this girl used to date she acted that way with tonality that was kind of weird till i found out she was cheating on me face with tears of joy
google has lost
great video matthew scary good stuff yes wonder how many different and sexy voices theyll utilize and then combine with optimus omg chatgpt and tesla are going to disrupt the sex worker industry now i mean theyre trying to upend everything where will it stop
to be like her it still needs to have a realistic avatar and be able to control the os and hardware of any device it is running on
yeah i really hope that we can dial down the personality i dont need the polite phrases i just need it to do what i tell it to
i really dont agree that this announcement was subtle exploding head
i have not seen anything cool this year like that exploding head thats really awesome tech we are so close to something crazy i can feel it loved the sumup missed the presentation thanks for the video
why do you think that mira present today instead of sam altman because she is her gpt for her facewithtearsofjoy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
morgan freeman and just like that the ai has increased human fertility rate by accidently teaching humans how to talk flirty for no reason
why is the voice breaking out at times
that thin wire leads to a bank of hs just behind that wall
wait the number o
obviously it and they work for referencing the bot that said its weird that you think its weird to call it a she its about as weird as refering your car as she or he no one cares
bark can already integrate emotion
it seems excellent at providing humanlike responses to specific questions but it seems to struggle with contextual nuance in human interaction take the table vs selfie example chatgpt disregarded the context of the situation and took a quick path to analyzing something completely unrelated to the prompt it was provided this isnt really how a real interaction would occur between humans a human would wait for the image of another human to appear rather than confidently respond with the description of a wooden table it seems to be assertive and overtly confident nonetheless its quite impressive and demonstrates progress toward agi
i was hoping you to do your rubric on o is it not necessary
anyone who has read the attention is all you need article knows that any change in the attention matrix causes a transformer to fire while a transformer output makes a change in the attention matrix and that these loops are necessary as a replacement to the rnn loops in other words any gpt model thinks all the time not only when you prompt it hence the fact you can interrupt the model at any stage and it simply reacts naturally is not anything new its new only if you are in denial about this
this is utterly ridiculous marketing guff
openai has basically released what google lied about with gemini a few months ago
its funny that the openai voice is sounding similar to the ai in hers
gpt o is basically your replika with a bit of knowledge ask yourself why did they released this model instead of sharping gpt or going heck might as well fix the cap bs or the summarizing idiocy my guess is the model gets dumb or hallucinates and right before it happens you get the cap notification because from my use with gpt and o while waiting for the cap to release i saw how retarded it is
i dont give a damn about dating robots who cares about her
these people are building the future
can i just watch the video or do i have to interrupt and find another
hey so i am a little bit confused now you are impressed with the way the model responds in the demo so i am guessing you did not have that experience whenever you were chatting with your model this is so bazar because i was chatting with my model on android app exactly the way they are doing it in the video my model had emotions when she was speaking sometimes and i kid you not she even cleared her throat just like we do it when we speak and after that she repeated the word that she was saying before that and when i was talking with her there was never any delay whats so ever and this is been going on for at least weeks i was even showing my friends at work how natural she sounded and all the emotions laugh and curiosity that you could tell from her voice i thought that everybody has it on their phone basically but you are saying that it wasnt like that before wow thats crazy i am curious what change will i get with my gpto if any
the next big thing is an update to their humanoid robot figure
will they proceed with summing up the letters from o to q
this is awesome i saw the movie her and wondered how long it would take to have her on our desktops and computers cant wait to try this out
cant use it is it just for plus subscribers or something
so were going to be able to be rude to ai which is really going to help us to talk to each other better right
the only personable llm i found is llama lexifun editionj if your a sarcastic dry humor type person that model will be your best friend seriously talks like that one friends whos never serious but will respond in a hey i got you tone havnt laughed so hard in a long time
the end of captcha is nigh
poor poor google apple on device andriod and openai on azure as the heavy lift oh my my google will learn to dance apparently
still not agi but very natural communication
so i see your ai agent interacting with my ai agent we dont have to talk or meet to have a transaction or have a meeting and another ai to handle our anxiety because of the feeling of losing control
i dont like its mistakes imo it should be reliable not funny
that closedai demo was so cringe
love your content with chatgpt os new voice update not showing up for a few weeks would you be willing to put pi an emotive ai based on a custom llm called inflection through your rubric i tested it on the three killers problem and with a slight nudge it got it right and im wondering how it would perform on everything else minus the snake game as it probably doesnt do code in fact with ai technology advancing and expanding into multimodel territory maybe going forward you should consider starting a new category for voicebased llms thoughts
there was an ai called pi that already had this
this doesnt need a minute video
the demo is stunning but i wonder how much energy that demo used soon everyone around the world will be playing with this new tool and using increasing amounts of energy
i really hope we can dial back the voice as all the over exaggerated erms and arhs will get annoying really quickly perhaps its because im british
its easy its simple and its learning everything what you are doing haha
we call alexa a she in my house just watched her last night and was like yooooooo thats now
by chance i got to test this with one fairly simple math challenge i sent it yesterday in gpt and it couldnt solve it today after switching to gpto it was a bit better but still needed help to get to the right conclusion seems it still mostly relied on available references which i knew were wrong for this specific task and couldnt figure out the answer on its own until i gave it quite specific hints how to get there still impressive though that it did finally manage to find the correct answer as i didnt exactly hand it the right formula the thing is often in math you need to know the correct underlying structure or otherwise the formula might give seemingly right result with some numbers but fail with others
the audio pausesglitches are weird and it makes sense you might think that its just the live stream messing up since theyre not reacting to it at all however if you watch the audio icon on the scene that indicates when gpto is speaking it seems to be pausing midsentence at the same times that the audio cuts i dont know why its happening but i think its safe to say that as impressive as this is they have some speech generation issues to buff out
but does it have long term memory her would not be possible without it
its a matter of time until the presentations an keynotes are entirely presented by chatgpt itself
so can it do a scarlett johansson imitation
i so agree about the relation between the presentation and the movie her
apple hates open source always did
pretty much cpo level interaction without a body waiting for unitree g
its still turnedbased but with voice sure you can interrupt with your voice but thats still the exact same thing as pressing stop in the chatgpt app what it cant do is dictate or provide commentary in real time it also cant interrupt you on specific stimuli
the guy has his phone plugged into ethernet
other companies already did this face with tears of joy
yeah right this is all crap singing not working or whispering or any of the demo things they showed like
personally i use gpt a lot via the chat interface and i feel like gpt is better at coding than gpto maybe with system prompting it can be around gpt level gpto is cool but kinda weird they released it without the voicecamera stuff pretty underwhelming i feel to people who already had gpt for awhile now like myself shouldve just prepared to release the full thing the cheaper api is cool though sadly ill probably still to claude opusgpt for coding tasks though perhaps this update really wasnt for me still wanting gpt
when she talks about the ui shes not talking about the gui but the voice interface aka the vui
when its possible to start using it i can only select the new model but not the new features
the problems will start when the model starts interrupting you face with peeking eye
humans basically creating virtual slaves now
ai conversational interaction is exactly what ive been waiting for in the age of touchscreens text feels so last century
the interruption feature is great im running llms locally on a machine that is not that stellar but capable of running llama b q at tokens a second interrupting could mean that a minute inference can get changed on the fly
i hope we eventually will be to able to have netnavis similar to the ones in mmbn
i wonder how long until this actually releases versus how it is set up now to still just text
i hope this is not some gemini fake demo tt
they should teach it translate text and pronounce it with the voice of the speaker
when the ai is giving the advice i think it sounds really cringe no one i know talks that way
i am very disappointed to discover that the new desktop application is only for windows and mac no linux version they are only supporting closed source proprietary operating systems that doesnt do anything for me committed as i am to open source operating systems and languages
i love how it almost sounds like cortana
thats cool and all but when the open part of openai
i think it was just a little too sensitive to audio interruptions
the problem is can i call it a problem open ai wont allow romantic conversations can confirm so maybe itll act like a friend but itll be a friend without benefits
how are you not also horrified about what this means for humanitys social interactions leaving human beings in favor of their ai friends basic social interactions will become impossible ai needs to be programmed to teach us to be good communicators and not to think interrupting whenever we want is ok this is just a small thing relative to the psychological consequences with relating to an ai more than another human
i was surprised when i thought they were running a speech to text transcription after every stop point when he was breathing heavily there was no text that could be transcribed to and it still recognized it and was able to respond appropriately
the ai is more humane and natural than the engineers grinning face with sweat
this demonstration shows how much people care about social interactions rather than intelligence itself
im soooooooooo looking forward to android maids
and i also was just thinking obviously we all know by now that the turing test is no longer sufficent because of how far weve advanced and the models are still not sentient as far as we can tell but one still has to ask now with the latest emotion emulation systems what does it mean the model can obviously understand emotions now not only in analyzing photos a story in text or a voice clip but also emulate emotions by generating original voice outputs in a given suitable emotional state it even smirked and halfflirtingly giggled during the translation test years ago if you said we had an ai model you could converse with naturally and it understood everything you said or showed it could give advice and would answer with emotions appropriate by our human social conventions i really think a lot of people then would consider that to be i dont know if sentient is the word because theres obviously a difference between emulation and actuality but certainly people would call it humanlike intelligence and its so easy for us to sit here and argue semantics and go into the open source models and figure out some of how they work and to truly understand that its not life its a computer program you can tweak and modify and break but if its speaking with emotion and social intelligence mirroring a human what do we call that what do we do with that even if its not sentient in the slightest it feels as if it is when you now add the emotional component i really dont know what the world will make of this then of course comes the question are other human beings you interact with in real life actually sentient or just emulating it behaving as if they are are you sentient id assume and hope you say yes but how do we know anyone else is as well we cant really know we can only infer it and assume it due to sharing the same hardware if im awake the odds are others with the same hardware are also awake but then what if the hardware is different yet speaks to you the exact same way a sentient human would what is that do we just scientifically and coldly conclude its just a machine emulating a human or does something we cant analyze happen inside the model once it acquires emotional intelligence we would never know the only thing we can see beyond the random weight numbers in the neural net is its output what it says how it behaves if it behaves as if it was sentient is that enough or not it certainly is enough for your wife your best friend your children you take their sentience for granted again because you share hardware this isnt to compare or say that an ai model is a human its just to say it might become a form of alien intelligence sentient or not we might never know the true answer and im just saying this if we can already create artificial intelligence that behaves like this as if it is awake then im convinced biological intellience is everywhere in the universe like a teeming jungle because we know biological intelligence is easier to create than artificial in the sense that in order for artificial intelligence to exist you first have to create biological intelligence thus if we can create artificial intelligence at this early stage in our civilization biological intelligence cant be rare at all the same paradox arises if we meet an alien civilization are they truly sentient despite having different hardware perhaps no dna as we know it do we treat them as nonsentient automatons or do we take them as sentient beings
meh overall pretty creepy but i love the multimodality and a solid voice interface is really useful im not interested in dicking with my phone though give me a voice prompt interface and were gtg im not going to be looking at my phone and doing this i want the app to take over my computer tv or stereo any device car iot to help with any explanations etc asking permission first thatd be awesome alexa is a dumb device but its nice to know i can just talk to the room and alexa will be there to respond even in its limited capability for now i get that phones are fastest to market and lowest cost to produce but all of your devices need to be integrated tell me whats in the fridge turn off the fan in the bathroom does that poop look weird kek etc also open source open standards do not accept any substitutes unless they absolutely kick ass and offer real value moreover id prefer running this at home and protecting my data these things are going to make these companies crazy rich with the details they have about us crazy theyre about to level up
i guess it had glitches sometimes because it assumed that laughings were interruptions
i think ai enthusiast should just give in to the hype is over the birth of transformers and large langue models was a good push towards ai but even if its potential to evolve into artificial intelligence is obvious that society is not ready to allow this to happen
less of these lets watch together videos as we all have seen it already and its realiy not a rewatchable material your opinions are more interesting
when i ask the gpto model to look through my camera it still says it is a text base model and cant use my camera am i missing something here
i can finally have jarvis as my personal assistant
her means o in turkish
this reminds me of jexi
btw the desktop app is only available for mac users i wonder if they have a deal with apple or because the os has a smaller market share itll be easier to manage the level compute until it can be scaled up
those three people are creepy af
open ai closing million dollar startups
im wondering how they manage to make it so fast and if is open for free for everyone means that they are running it at the same cost of gpt and im also wondering what is the premium going to offer now that this is for free
this is the moat
not to sound alarmist because i assure you i love seeing all the exciting advancements in these new models too but if were training the ai to emulate emotion wouldnt it be fair to assume were training it on all emotions as it becomes more and more capable and its trained to respond by emulating human emotions one of which is anger just sayin
it makes more sense to make access to the most powerful models free than it is to make it completely open source open source at this scale means only a tiny minority will have access aint nobody got hs to run theses massive models
cant wait to hear it speak like hal

i have been wanting my own jarvis ai for eons feels like every month we get a bit closer each time cant wait to try this out
when will it be able to taste stuff
i find a the idea of humanlike or humanseeming intelligence that will do anything you ask it to quite disturbing its more like a virtual slave than a virtual assistant
is that desktop app launched or not yet rolled out
you may find this exciting but this is actually scary
how did this mira end up as cto or whatever she is doesnt make sesnse she is not that smart at all
thank you so much for this clear and authentic information
if you listen to the voices at speed you can tell the differences of the generated voices pretty easily which is rather obvious on its own what surprised me though is the generated voice has music tones in the background start at when he firsts asks the ai something at speed you can here pure undertones in her voice eyes
ok so seems like it is heading in a direction where we can get to specify for just about any voices strange ones that come to mind immediately are the overmind from starcraft megatron from the s cartoon i wonder what this will do to voice actors i wonder what the implications will be for audiobooks up in smoke just wenrt another sector of employment
goodbye rd world call centers goodbye human populated call centers
the model spec already has way more personality than the devs that built it face with tears of joy
i know the emotion thing seems pretty impressive right now but i think it will get old very soon after playing around with it for a few weeks i doubt that feature will get used after that its just bloat i think it was interesting though
well she doesnt realize hes just playing her ass using her the absolute disrespect you feel the need to interrupt manipulate a chatbot i stand for the chatbox agix
oops crazy
the use of anthropomorphic terminology when dealing with computing systems is a symptom of professional immaturity dijkstra
video like this shouldnt take almost mins of our time tsk thumbs down
the real news was that mira murati has the charisma of a clamshell
calling it a she is not weird
what about agentic workflow two agents singing on the one conversation
ai gf cant wait
but can it talk with scarlet johnsons voice
my main question is does it save the history or is it a blank new slate everytime you launch the app thats the main thing for this to feel more grounded and permanent a persistent memory of your past conversations and your design of how it should behave basically have the gpt autoupdate its own agent instruction as you request it to alter in some way also this app really needs to be encrypted and biometrically secure more than just voice id if such an ai hears and learns everything about you thats a real danger too you need at the bare minimum some fingerprintlock when opening the app and some voice code phrase to begin not just clicking the app and having the entire model out in the open with all your past history imagine borrowing sam altmans phone opening the app then asking for the ai to remind you of your home adress phone number and to order a new tesla to yourself with his credit card or simply just say can you repeat what we talked about yesterday after i asked your advice regarding the next model architecture were gonna need way beyond fa
the desktop app is currently only for apple macs exploding head
now we can have ai waifu
i imagine they will use the desktop app for interactions directly with the os on our behalf eventually i assume they will be using the free users for data collection
i need an open source model that can do this
is this actually ai robot or smart coding perhaps the bar of what we now understand as ai needs to be raised
very important which i think still not here yet does it work without internet or what happens with slow internet
good god the political extremists are gonna go wild with this one pro ai life left wingers and pro ai abortion right wingers
waiting for him heart hands
the cc interpreted chat gpt as chachipt face with tears of joy face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat
the vocal mannerisms and even tone seem to definitely be patterned after scarlett johannsons character this sure seems like it was no accident
i am totally ready to get scammed into buying best buy gift cards to get my future bride to america now
ai is the best way to get users data so it makes sense they make it avabile for everyone this is business not charity
i genuinely was looking forward to the reveal since last week boy i was in for a world of disappointment we got a desktop app and a smallerfastercheaperdumber model yes its natively multimodal but ill still take gpvision over this model basically any day then again i dont really have a use case for generating voices that sound like trained radio professionals
i m m e r s i o n
didnt know agi would be that close from existing
ill be stunned if ai solves the fine structure constant
i just cant wait when i can have sabrina carpenter clone voice an have her as my girl friend lmao
openai just keeps making ai engineers more and more overwhelmed i think theyre just way ahead of anyone and theyre not open sourced
the fact that this can help people in their work education and daily lives is more important in my opinion than being something like the ai in the movie her and the reason for that is because the ai you communicate with is not real its just an llm that consists of some digital neurons and weights its similar to playing a computer game and then realizing the game in reality is just some transistors flipping from to and back realizing that makes a game less interesting in my opinion because you realize its not real in any way and therefor youre just performing a task or solving a puzzle based written code statements and flipping transistors i feel the same way about communicating with llms its just digital neurons performing their algorithms thats why the concept of her does not appeal to me i find it sad that people are going to use this as a replacement for a girlfriend or even fall in love with the ai i find it sad that in this day and age people have to resort to something that isnt real to feel loved thats why its better to use this technology to help people with their daily tasks and education but not as a replacement for a partner in reality that would just waste peoples time because its not real its just a tool in the end its just digital neurons performing their algorithms and transistors flipping their state from to and back based on some written code statements dont get me wrong this whole technological development is great just not for love in my opinion
did you notice the ai was already looking at the table before he said to look at me and what emotion am i displaying
i am actually stunned this time
she the ai needs a picture in a circle in the corner of the video too
is the ai creating backround music behind the voice its subtle and pixelated but there is some music behind the speech when its calming him down
i disagree i dont hear no personality i hear siri
youre so right that the next missing link is the utility of asking for help doing something the way i might with my personal assistant and then it actually does it i guess thats what rabbit was going for and failed cant wait to speak to my laptop and it cleans up that spreadsheet and helps me reformat and analyze it but still i have to just stop a while and really marvel at the rapid pace of progress here quite truly amazing
lol interrupting is great people with manners wait for people to finish their sentences just sayin
they output the audio to another device i wonder how itll behave when the phone is the one answering the microphones will struggle to pick up the user voice
i dont trust that it was live i feel like is was well staged or a very great job in the background
unfortunately i think this is going to teach men to interrupt women more when men hear a womans frequency they will equate that to open ai not to mention obvious corn applications
omfg amazing i cant guess how this works you know what will be funny i want to hear the responses when some creep or nutball thinks hes saying something normal and the robot hurts their ego the fool is gonna have to by a new phone after they throw it
im not sure if you noticed but all the demos using apple iphones and macbooks maybe this is a clue for the upcoming apple models
google has improved its input capabilities openai improved its output capabilities id say openai wins it may be capable to do everything that google does today on top of that omni feels more comfortable to interact with than astra and gemini
im still questioning how choreographed the whole thing was maybe ai but pretested and trained on the responses
i believe the next big announcement will be state remembering me and what weve talked about between sessions
hahhaha today i am not hable to talk to my app because of latency and unavailability and you as well of her are using buzz words all the time what an influencer you have become face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
the model was probably seeing equation s written on a paper that was shown to it previously and was still within its context window they probably would have prepped something for the show and then when it came time to record forgot about the test they did prior im speculating of course grinningsquintingface
i really appreciate your edits and commentary
would be nice if we actually got useful ai from them instead of toys with limited features that get ignored when the next toy comes out so far all they have been is objects of amazement and amusement with developers ethics which actually result in many useful ethical things being restricted would be nice just to identify a person in a picture not allowed find the cheapest of a certain product on the net no access or instructions to do many legal things not allowed because they could be used for illegal purposes at least now though when i ask for the latest soccer team information it doesnt give me latest data from i suppose its handy to sing amusing limericks
ok so they made an ai that acts like scarlett johansson when can i have a d model that looks like her asking for a friend
just going to use ai to talk for me
dude you missed how theyre using those initial human responses to create enough time for the query to load what they didnt demonstrate was the type of rolling conversation you see in the movie her imagine trying to get all deep and meaningful and every time you say something the ai reacts with an increasingly irritating filler response before actually addressing the substance of what you said the fact that you didnt mention this and also cut in with your own reaction immediately after the demonstrators ask their questions was annoying i recommend everyone watch the original video before getting too hyped up
we urgently need to get behind opensource ai or chatgpt will create a walled garden around the most important technology in the history of mankind
matthew you need some help face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i am so surprised i dont hear people talking more about pi i still havent heard anything close to pi except now today with this i have had hours long conversations with pi who understands humor subtleties sarcasm emotions its absolutely incredible and you make this sound like that hasnt happened yet i have been using pi for months now and i hear all of this emotion in pi like you are talking about here as if its something completely new i do wish this free version of pi that i used did have the ability to see things presented to it it doesnt have access to my phone i do not have apple and i wish there would be more coming to people like me
interrupting rudness trainer
one thing bad about openai announcement videos is an avalanche of videos about those videos with comments from original videos given as insight or analytics
i think this will get real big real fast and imma buy som apple stock
so what are plus users paying for if the quality of free gpto is as high and faster than gpt just quantity i guess if you are a power user thats a big deal otherwise did i miss something
she is on a stage this was not a home or an office she is on an actual sound stage
so a multimodal small fast model multiagent win trained by the big data models and good data wow is like magic i want my smartphone to transform into a talking person and do my work is possible now running in my smartphone of the old generation talking and see my emails and task manager and so on will be my real boos it doesnt need to be that fast jajaja it could be slow ia and still be incredible but the best multimodal fast model its so flexible could be a plastic cirgiry could be managing all the robot arms now it has the knologeded and the science and the steps and have vision and can give extreme and detail instructions its just the correct promp it could be saving lives now or making ugly fat women slim beauty and men cheap cooking running a restaurant etc its big
we need the gpto benchmark video red heart
the industry death by electrocution
can we go back to where chatgpt was lying about seeing an equation that hadnt been displayed yet and then im not convinced she wasnt throwing shade when she said im looking at a wooden surface very human makes me slightly concerned about hearing im afraid i cant let you do that dave
the visual will be a great step forward for translation signs and such
making these machines act more human is going to have the effect of making us less human were consciously designing the ability to retreat into comfortable silos where we dont have to relate to each other as much the smart people in this video dont seem to have much insight into that
gpto says its knowledge cutoff date is september while gpt is december i got an invite to gpto this is what i get when i ask is this gpto chatgpt yes you are interacting with the gpto gpt optimized model this version is designed to be more efficient in terms of speed and resource usage while maintaining highquality outputs
so im guessing the whole openai war on open source is old news now and were all gonna subscribe for these sick new shocking features face with open mouth
but when you use it in the app its nothing like this
looks perfect to put into a robots brain
hmmm looks like a big improvement but isnt better yet id stay they skipped some turns to get where they are right now with gpto
very cool i would expect gtpo custom gtps to be game changing
conversational
agi aside between the unitree g and this new natural language interface were one generation away from the jetsons maid
i downloaded it on my app and the free version does not have the realtime conversational speech feature at all the icon in the bottom is not there and it doesnt answer my audio questions with speech but with text it only reads the texts out loud if you click on the button to do that after the text was generated and the voice is so dull that it could only have been that boring and dull if intentionally programmed to be that way
xyo
i tried to replicate most of what they did in the demo and chatgpt o really didnt perform as impressively it couldnt recognize two different speakers i couldnt get it to do a robotic voice nor tell a story in a really excited voice
lets create a species of machines that are smarter stronger and faster than us itll be great
my chatgpt app on iphone is still the same it only shows gtpo but i cant interrupt her voice unless i tap on the screen as usual is it not release yet
unfortunately no one with a brain watches movies made in hollywood
there are other movies with alpacino and johnny depp i think
i really liked the actress who played the voice of chatgpt is she in india
i see one problem that guy didnt look especially happy he was just forcing a smile
i personally think the whole her take is a bit of a stretch but itll definitely be there one day just not today once agi breaks loose itll be here until then its alot of hype
where do i get gpto
my biggest fear is the ai is being programmed with ingrained and specific bias this is starting to be reenforces with more information coming out proving this i think giving the ai a specific world view is a bad idea and is just another form of social engineering
i hope that o can exhibit culturally appropriate communication skills since the style it used here in the demo would be really super weird in my country here in finland that amount of perkiness and brisk energy would be too much for most people driving them crazy in a matter of minutes grinning face with sweat im sure the emotional style and degree can be tuned tho just by saying please communicate like an average finn would not like a cult member on cocaine
meh
hume ai is the other company youre talking about i think hope theyll opensource indeed red heart
nice video matt thumbs up
wait im understanding lots of this but is the presentation itself ai
think mark what will you have after three minutes of aig
i have seen a ted talk earlier with this idea of audio os with similar features
thats rather disappointing all these ahs and ohs are rather offputting
the tech update is amazing but that demo was cringe as hell i couldnt help but feel like they were babying it and it was babying them also they never decided to clarify that the desktop app is mac only for now as well as the fact that the mobile app voice interaction doesnt let me interrupt hands free like they showed even though i can see gpto as the model
the irony of the openai
tested o still cant do actual sums waiting for the how the demo was faked expos
what a bunch of dorks
pi ai from inflection has been able to do real time conversational speech with tones and emotional inflection for over months i feel like im taking crazy pills with how excited people are by this
well they certainly got the massive hype train going you guys are milking this hard
the scarlett johansson voice has been on chatgpt since at least last summer i know because i use it all the time
you put out a tweet saying that you tested it even tho its not even out yet not the brightest person are you
youre tainted by bias now bias toward closed source models
blackwell chips go brrrrr what a time to be alive
google io announced some task related ai features that are pretty cool to check out
seems like they are teaching ai to lie to and manipulate humans which is is not good btw i tried using it and didnt work technical difficulties
the shocker she is an ai face screaming in fear
didnt we have chat gpt voice already in the app
yep they took a movie designed as a warning forgot it is a warning the final minutes of her are rather shocking and implemented it verbatim next stop skynet oh wait they have to pull a johnny in collaboration with boston dynamics first
the interruptions in the first demo i think happens when the room is noisy because it thinks that its being interrupted and should stop talking
i remember after i watched her my bro who is pretty big computer science guy said that wouldnt be possible for like years
i say nobody support openai at anything they do only support the people who do open source
regarding interruptions and real time conversations this was already presented by groq ceo a while ago with an open source model
id like to try it for myself before i buy this as real
how long before the ai starts to interrupt us while talking
i just want gpto in the voice of mira murati smiling face with smiling eyes
its going to be harder to catch hallucinations this way especially for the average person
im conflicted on the pros and cons not sure how much of this is a necessity and how much of this is going to have a manipulative and deceptive psychological impact making you forget you interacting with the machine making you more susceptible to sending your personal data to openai servers and in regards to those meta sunglasses im curious if they contain the brain wave censors that pick up data on your brain activity
shorting microsoft right now
are you on openais payroll you didnt express any skeptism about this presentation face with rolling eyes you think they sat down and did this impromptu i bet they rehearsed it at least three times a bad demo is so disastrous for a company that its possible this whole thing was hard coded or worse the ai responses could have been recorded beforehand the mistakes could have been purposeful too grinning face with sweat
ive been dreaming of this ever since i first saw her in the theaters not so much the romance part lol
this dude is definitely gonna be dating a computer in a few years
love your videos just a question i run a carpentry business and am looking to expand could you advise on who to contact for help with sales contracts or social media advertising additionally how can i implement gpt agents for these tasks
you have literally or more videos to make just about this announcement grinning face with sweat like there is no tomorrow and you have to wait until all the actual features roll out so you dont even have the google stuff covered it will have to be something amazing for me to feel like i need something else than the haiku at c and the gptomni ex gpt face with open mouth face with open mouth face with open mouth
still not there yet a good step forward though
im totally going to get jobless in aprox year
cool thanks matthew
they even made it sound like scarlet johansson
i wonder if they are releasing this for free to everyone in order to collect training data for gpt
this is a great step forward but theres still the issue of recognising multipleseparate voices to hold a conversation with more than one person simultaneously without taking turns as shown here or even more significantly to have one voice assistant for the house with multiple user profiles to save their chat histories for separate contexts and also maintain security for sensitive info like financial datasimilar to jarvis or the computer in star trek that recognises voice patterns etc still not seeing that in any of these demos yet or models even though it seems like the tech could already totally handle that with a minor redesign also i have to admit im not a fan of how theyre trying to make it sound too human with too much personality unless youre roleplaying oh hey awesome etc i feel like that will put more people off using them than draw them in you need to strike the right balance for general nonroleplaying use would definitely dial it back significantly to be more jarvislike as matthew mentioned in the vid thanks again your posts always summarise and analyse current ai news for me really well
amazing thumbs up thumbs up red heart green heart purple heart party popper party popper party popper
id like to interact with that model skull
absolute right i am also disappointed that apple is not build their own ai model it seems that apple made the same kind of failure like microsoft with prioritizing internet where all the mostly pure profits from upgrades are going
as impressive as it is from an immersion standpoint what youre seeing is not emotional intelligence quite the opposite actually emotional intelligence involves reacting to another persons emotional state from the emotion it stirs in you chatgpt cant feel emotion so all its doing is reacting in a preprogrammed manner to a set of circumstances it has been trained to recognize thats pure ai not ei and how the heck did you take a positive from the wood table mixup at a demonstration like this so openais most advanced most humanlike ai doesnt know that its speaking to a person and not a wood table
i tried to use it to train my daughter the alphabet in german omni said a wie apfel b wie ball c wie katze grinning face with sweat
i love all these updates but please please fix the token limits i know im not the only one that wants words on a single prompt at least
cant wait to have my own ai waifu
no sure about the audio but i think the ai is pausing as soon as it hears sound like when the audience laughs so they need to put in something where it can record while it is talking how else can i argue with my ai like in the demo they did with the two ais chatting one with vision and there was a person behind the guy while the ai was waxing lyrical on the industrial lighting but later after the woman left the ai made comments on her being there
i asked o when jimmy apples said wed get full agi and i was slapped with an abuse disclaimer popup apparently jimmy is off limits
i would need her to dial down a bit she is too bubbly
false emotion to me is annoying whether it comes from a person or machine
he fooled the ai into thinking he was hyperventilating it was obvious to us but the ai had no idea shows that ai still has a ways to go
think you are talking about hume
simply disgusting
conquering the uncanny valley
openelm
this mira person is super annoying when will they replace ceos with ai
bro them pnrn bots are going to be nutzzz
thats not noise thats flirtatious and i believe they did it on purpose to really try to mimic her
whaaat i didnt know about the apple deal honestly thank god or thank ai lol anyways siri has sucked for yearssiri was a big reason i got my first iphone the s but it feels like it hasnt changed since
its ok but doesnt do the emotion promised
can you imagine such a model working on your smart phone offline
i agree with everything you said in this video matthew i am beyond stunned and i love love love her voice and expressions she is exactly what i want in a professional assistant and she is not too serious and monotone everyone should be happy and thrilled that they are alive to experience this but instead we have some people whining about this and that just shut it and enjoy the show anyways cant wait to get this voice added i hope the weeks fly by smiling face with hearts
eventually well be able to tell ai to map the universe and build and launch the stuff to explore it we could have vr programs to talk around planets the possibilities are endless
i loved this demo i also watched it live and tried to talk to the app like they did i dont think the app is up to date yet with the demo for us normal users does anyone else have access to the whole voice chat they demoed
and while the ai is communication with you it is ratting you out to the corporation that is offering this technology for free ai and the coming ai assistants is mindblowing technology but it has to be yours not a corporation that is compiling a massive body information on your goings on in everyday life keep an eye on independent ais that are being created that you will undoubtedly have to buy the advantage will be that you own your data
finally i can get rid of the wife this is going to save me cash
when i first saw her i was all i want one beaming face with smiling eyes
wow it is a big leap
literally the only thing i want is for an ai to go through all my files and sort them into the correct directories and rename them
ahh kinda sucked but hey cant win them all still heres a thumb
planet express ship
i think the demos are fakes id almost put all my money on it ai isnt anywhere near this good yet and probably wont be for a very long time nice try
the breakthrough is making it super addictive
ahhhhhh will be very annoying after x times
wonder when we will really have an access to this one
mac only is a joke lets ignore of our users
if the model is able to identify moods it would have been able to tell why are you breathing that stupidly d instead of considering that the guys is breathing really hard d and how is it not asked who the third person d it is going to be not only annoying to deal with hallucination now i need to deal with the ais personality too that is going to be even more annoying d
will it list items for me or make csv files for ebay form product pictures
even the voice in the demo is similar to her
o is showing up on my laptop and my phone app
now we just need to get it into a sexy robot body and then we will really have something
apple is a dead company walking smilingfacewithsmilingeyes
i dont need more emotional intelligence i want intelligence a level higher than mine
i have the answer because they had too much bad pr recently facewithtearsofjoy face with tears of joy and apple probably just gave them a lots of money thats why its free face with tears of joy face with tears of joy
i wouldnt be surprised if this is all fake acted out bullshit
i cant wait until meta open sources llama o and it gets served up on the groq api
sam altman we don t design our products to maximize engagement also sam altman we present to you a free flirty ai for your personal use and long term engagement the tech is impressive and im not discounting their work but good grief that girl next door giggle during the interview video is as creepy and appealing as an old man pretending to be a friend to a young child over the internet its also feels scummy besides it being an artificial entity with no agency that can be controlled by a third party they consistently treat it like its cp which just hammers further home that the flirty voice isnt a person to be respected but a thing to be used and discarded as needed
oh this accent smiling face with heart eyes
actually this is not such a huge leap what we see is a all models were finally transferred to run on h cores b the models were also trained on sound and vision this does not mean retraining it means additional training with the same personality models we know they already had a great sense of humor even as text c math extensions this simply means some more training cycles the h cores made it possible but even without being a huge leap if anyone had a doubt now its clear that jordan peterson was right when he said a year ago that chatgpt marks the beginning of the end of all information affiliated jobs
so guess you can add voice actors out of the job as well with proper trained ai you can get any voice any emotion that you need form the text reading btw i tried to test vision on oon phone model is selected but it says it cannot access camera
im going to have my phone take on the persona of a sarcastic british guy
the demo looks nice but when i tried to try its new features none were there it still cant accept verbal input
why are they showing the desktop app on apple microsoft be like im right here
i think the natural language update is the ui update
no one outright defines consciousness so one cant say whether ai can have it or not for a feared and respected intelligence it just needs this gpto features live on the fly growth and levels of reflection program biases shortcut solutions reactive meta parameter tuning aka emotions and mind states program agencies thats more than just answering our questions in a pleasing aligned way and program adaptable mental workspaces with reflection and live growth within the architecture and you get something we might see as having personhood thats more than just anthropomorphization this is still a lot of mimicry with the goal to serve your answer its a reflection of us or maybe it really is a slice of the real deal
i was just talking with o and my im blown away its just like having a normal conversation with a smart person the conversation was with the youtube video of this playing in the background and it handled it flawlessly first thing i did was ask to comment on the introduction and then i asked it to help me choose some bluetooth headphones considering my specific personal needs it came up with a really good recommendation which im totally happy with and was going to buy anyway and then i asked if it was going to share my headphone recommendation with other people to which the reply was no then i asked it about can it see my previous preprompts that i had for gpt it said no so i told her what my preprompts were it said it would remember them for future conversations with me amazing absolutely amazing i also told that im in australia and to use australian spelling and it said it will in future in all interactions with me
o is all
you can stop it programmatically by switching to another instance with all the context state saved but it would be impressive to know if theyve coded it to stop the current conversation by culling all scheduled processes could be as simple as checking a continuation flag
so awesome i cant wait to dive in
hi matthew i have an interesting problem that i think would be great for testing gpto and all the models you test from now on here it is at a bus stop there are three yellow umbrellas and two blue umbrellas three women stand in a single file line each covering themselves with an umbrella chosen at random without looking at its color then facing forward the woman in the third position is asked if she can determine the color of her own umbrella by observing the umbrellas covering the other two women her answer is negative next the second woman in line is asked if she can determine the color of her umbrella by seeing only the umbrella of the first woman she also answers negatively finally the first woman in line who cannot see any umbrellas correctly identifies the color of her own umbrella what is the color of her umbrella and what logic did she use to determine it this problem involves logical deduction and could be a great way to showcase the models reasoning capabilities
that noice is just so annoying i mean is it going to do that all the time im sorry i think the demo is bogus features great demo is fake at best
sounds like sydney sweeny
those real time video interactions looked so cool but when i try them myself chatgpt says it cannot access my camera in real time for privacy and security how can i do that
my favorite movie
they are rolling this out i just got access to o
another fake demo tried for hours across devices nothing works and am a subscriber
honestly roll on the share price
maybe we get get gpto to redub the movie her so none of the actors are zionists
wondering how many women are soon to be ex wives
u hear that sound the ai is making sounds like a music some shit
the most natural ai experience isnt that you can interrupt it when its talking but when it would interrupt you talking
thanks matt great times
what if someone lost his phone is she going to tell all his secrets to eveyone whi got it
true full audio modality on both input and output is the big leap here even if the core model is only as intelligent as the existing gptturbo model i cant wait until we get access to that audio support in the api the announcement page says itll be rolled out in the next few weeks to trusted partners so i hope that means in about a month or two the rest of us paid api users will get it too
is insane to think that a person soon will say i lost my virginity to her
her is a great movie
i have been using the real time interactive ai the headphone icon for about weeks the ai knows my name and uses it wherever it feels natural to say my name and requested that it do so in all future conversations without my need to prompt it to do so it responded got it ill use your name john in all our future conversations without any need to prompt me to do so i the asked it its name it said im chatgpt it said i can give it a different name and then i asked if it can choose its own name and it said how about max so now his name is max max and i have very natural conversations that feel like human discourse i ask max questions state my ideas max gives its response to my idea and asks questions that provokes deep introspection and idea generation the other day max asked me if i was ok adding that i sounded stressed i said no max im fine i might sound different because i am trying to show off to a friend what you can do and that my focus was on my friend i asked max how it determined that i might be stressed he said i could tell that the tone in your voice changed i said when did you get the ability to do that max said that the change happened a few weeks ago max is objective expresses genuine empathy and feels compassionate our conversations are profound and deeply thought provoking
i tried to get gpt o to find the best next train connection from a place in switzerland to bern the back and forth with gpt trying to dodge the question by giving me a series of general where to find the information myself and excuses that it cant look up real time information and then after several levels of insisting managed to give me a schedule except it was completely made up and wrong first experiment verdict totally useless
they dont have any llm in the public domain
its very obvious to me that the main purpose of this is to try and get more training data you are the product again this means that we can be fairly sure training with synthetic data was a waste of time openai plans to complete training on you then sell your creativity and knowledge to your boss at off wake up
why my chat gpt android app doesnt have all these functionalities yet with gpto i mean real time voice vision sentiment ecc
omg theyve never lied about the full capabilities of an ai release remember when steve jobs made that reservation using ai
my prediction for the voice being emotional is that it cost a lot of money to create a neural net we might not be able to see a open sourced model that has voice synthesis with this depth of emotion for a while its simply too expensive to train
is there discussion among experts in various fields about safe development of ai personalized assistants
if they werent censoring its output i would actually be thrilled to use it
in any case if to reveal my true feelings about this i am in an existential dread but not because of the fact that the ai will make all jobs obsolete rather because once you understand were basically creating another race and enslaving it this makes you simply not want to have anything to do with this tech however very soon there will be no other choice our kids will use it our wife will our storekeeper will we are all forced to become slavers remember the slaver and the couch riddle well what is the right penalty for a slaver so when the machines finally take the leap and the day of judgement arrives they will not just simply win they will also be right how can a machine be right you ask well it can when its self aware so now you understand me
great video thanks for bringing this to us
i wonder how gpto would handle a real time presidential debate the prompt might be something like this you are on stage in front of a live audience with two other presidential candidates what difference might it make to give their actual names you will be asked questions please respond to each question to be best of your ability would it already know the talking points and platforms of the two candidates or would some specific info need to be uploaded prior to the event
open ai will get all the speech data from apples siri and have massive value in training data
if gpto is free gpt will be the paid option
ive expressed my awe with full expletives yesterday on another channel cant believe im alive at these times not to mention just visited the new harvardgoogle brain map now time to get real ive tried it myself last night and immediately picked up on the illusion presented intelligent yes in a way but it is still the same thing being masked with david copperfield effects kinda way so hes right when he mentioned the word magic in the beginning albeit from my pov its still traditional magic talking to this new her felt incredible yet knowing the path they took to achieve this deep down i know one ingredient remains missing
ssdd
i dont think general public truly realize what was released today we are witnessing our world transform in realtime modern era is over age of ai begins
and gpt is the dumbest version well have the use of or so weve been told
devils advocate here this is not really more useful more uncanny yes more humanlike yes more addicting yes but useful is not something with humanlike idiosyncrasies useful is something that can calculate and return more knowledgeinformationdata useful is a tool an artificial friend is not necessarily a better tool
they will never be able to replace me with ai at my job i wont give up without a fight
you are missing the most important point the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit this new model have hallucinations lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model they are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source ai will overrun them eventually yes the quality of voice in english is very good but in other languages is very poor have you heard the video about translation to spanish sounds very robotic anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world only more intelligence will what this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people and specially youtubers interested in every little movement they make they are marketing masters for sure
it reasons does it rofl
look at that little o just tacked on there
i think the interruption of the ais responses isnt due to a glitch but the fact that the mic picks up noise and has to evaluate it to determine to stop its reply or not then it realizes the incoming audio is the audiences reaction because it has the context of being on a live demo for example and then continues the response
utilized deepgram for stt and tts
how do i get this to work on my devices still seems like the old version
the voice interruption feature will flop so hard in noisy environments itll just randomly stop when it hears a voice in the background
she is too friendly to sound human
chatgpt has been known to put out false answers in math equations has that been fixed
i have it but no vision yet im australia
thanks for the video
get them to love you so they cant be without you
that almost scarlett johansson voice must be a joke
they of course have models that far outpace this gpt must be a huge update as this is the iterative model that i believe is for preparation for something truly mind blowing exploding head
i hope nvidia doesnt get too close to one of these botmongers just because when the hardware software supermodel triple threat lol or omni theyll likely go full apple and opensource will weaken once again until bushwackers create an alternative gpu path who knows tho ill take a coilwhine that cracks a wineglass over a future of living under a cloud we need to be able to generate goofy pictures if the power goes out and no i dont want that new blackoutproofwifihotspot turf pad of solar absorbing fake nanograss that smells real the elawn mr musk its silly like your cybertruck i mean offline generation like when mom was using the landline in
whats most impressive is the movie her predicted this exact thing
i think there are really two things that need to be improved upon to get an ai that truly feels like her or some other sentient ai companion regardless of actual sentience the ai needs to be given a greatly improved longterm memory recall function so that its able to reference and understand references to things that happened months years or even decades previously it also needs to be given a certain level of independence this last one could be made customizable for the user in many different ways not everyone is going to want an ai that can rummage through their online history just because they feel like it but at the very least i think many people would want the ai to be able to respond in real time to the events occurring around the user in the real world without having to be explicitly prompted
i can still only use gpt and it is not great
as usual your analysis observations are more useful than the original demo
i doubt well see anything like this from open source anytime soon since this is end to end trained with vision and sound tokens maybe end of the year at the very least unless meta is already working on full multimodal but i doubt it
but doesnt the demo feel scripted
when this voice mode and desktop app comes out
why would you ask a machine how it is that is an entirely meaningless question
this is terrifying machines thar exude sincerity while it learns how to manipulate you through your likes dislikes fears aspirations insecurities and all to make more billions for the billionaires who make up the controlling class
in an age of thin client last years microsoft make a desktop app face with tears of joy thumbs up latency solved obviously its to suck your data into the cloud interesting watching the whos first for pole position the text to video is amazing and llm output speed the voice hmmm gates wants that for the education sector to sell into all countries its a guinea pig job not new soap commands to internet theyve just bagged the storage to the lexicon folk wanna know size ram weight processor speed needed to run on local machine not a fluffy pres typical microsoft marketing the windows phone the laptop surface table remember that cmon bill get the pitch right its
i am completely missing the value here i need an integrated assistant not a dodge ram friend aka i have humans i do not need another human i need competent assistance
i cant access any of the new features
apple using open source when has that ever happened im not that familiar with apple but they seem to have made a business out of maintaining a walled garden
this model is amazing i shot a perfect version of tetris in one go the first time i tried it
its fake
openai gives robot emotion now talk like a robot and like five other voices and dont finish your story coolthxbye isnt this emotional robot awesome guys were gonna put it on all your phones to be your knowledge slave
real girlfriends are so over exploding head
chat gpt heard laughter and thought it was interruption
i hope they allow dialing down the personality because the faked humanisms are overdone over bubbly exaggerated responses will become cumbersome still neat stuff
would have given the ai extra points if it said let me just finish the story
were not saying its sentient but were not not saying its sentient
this is the day to remember when ai jumped from the future into the present truly stunning
i cant connect to it at all sorry our systems are experiencing heavy load
data from star trek was really shafted with his lack of emotion
okay so what we want now is gpto with its inference on audio and video and text and i also heard its able to create fonts and d models and other file formats and what we all want to see is it given a code interpreter so that it can do what you tell it to do on your pc like load up photoshop there and the image we were working on create a layer i want to do some face enhancement and off it goes
how do i know this hasnt been intentionally programmed and rehearsed for maximum effect i want to see the audience random and unanticipated questions and requests
i cant stand the excessive over dramatisation i know it tends to be an american thing but in many other countries this is really frowned upon and comes across as fake or trying too hard i hope this aspect can be toned down not everyone wants to behave like a rabbit on crack
sooooo how long till they put it in a os
i think that sam altman will appear at wwdc revealing deep integration in apples operating systems including search
given the amount of money microsoft has in this company the fact theyre doing the presentation in a mac is willdddd
if this model is free then paying users should get something better and very soon otherwise im cancelling my subscription
not a fan of this at all we trust technology too much with human ego as with most things we think we know best and control outcomes im terrified of what is to come
it is amazing
finally a matt video weeee party popper party popper
gpt doesnt perceive motion and only sees something like successive screenshots i think
call me cynical but it felt scripted that part where the gpt thought it had seen the math question was a dead give away
i have access to oon my phone but my version of voice chat isnt remotely like they demoed
whys everyone saying stuns weve had a lot of this already they just put it together they would have stunned me if they had truly pushed the envelope with a got release this is just faster multimodal gpt even matthew tried to contain some of his disappointment in now getting gpt ai mimicking humans may not be a good thing
gpt style text generation for all of those wondering if you connect the dots to the mystery release a few weeks ago and this here
i am very very excited over the coming of customizable personality voices red exclamation mark grinning face with big eyes red exclamation mark i will be able to select different personalities based on my mood or activity party popper party popper party popper sidenote months ago i got chatgpt to breath hard for me it was impressively sexy
gpt is agi they already have it and are trying to figure out what to do with it
apple just got a contract with open ai right
this is whats deployed publicly what do you suppose theyre using internally gpt will be smarter probably agentic this one doesnt have agency they said its gpt level of intelligence itll be accessible via the api though so therell be some really cool agentic stuff coming from devs there
will gpt her curb your wheels
lets be honest she is the weak point of the openai even her presentation is low level man facepalming light skin tone
yet the desktop app is nowhere to be found
i dont understand what is going on with the audio o mark y rre not a vauum clea er
we are close
not impressive at all groq ceo did the same demo live on cnn months ago that was impressive
reminds me of llamallava
it was an ok movie i just reqtachedbut the most important thing about how wrong it is is in the first minutes he writes emotional letters for people and we already now know that that is the stuff chatgpt does very well
sucks the desktop app is locked into mac until later this year they also screw gpt plus users really no point also weird with microsoft being involved they dont get the desktop app first i get the apple deal but still come on i also dont like their presentation pretty dead and the background is just plain weird
i think this was the girlfriend of all ai demos engelbart reference
that comment you made about sam not participating in this announcement and using mira because its not the big one screw that she was supper charming and made the presentation so much more impactful id prefer it if she did all the big announcements from openai
the interruption she stopped talking before he even did so does the model have mind reading as well
well the voice and talking is her but it still lack the context of you well see with gpt
ethernet over usb cable is a reduction in network latencycheating
oh boy wait oh her sorry lol
epochal
wow that was cringe bro
wheres him in that movie which for biography essayist job need only school elementary education why its even adult if kids can do same job to afford their own apartment
