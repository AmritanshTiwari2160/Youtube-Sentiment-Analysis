They sound like they're being tortured when they sing...
Why do I feel bad for the AI when they’re singing
We are fuc#$@
"This is brilliant! I can't wait for this tech to trickle down into everyday uses like monitoring the driver of a car for signs of tiredness stroke etc. Monitoring crime in shops and public spaces. This is going to be transformative!"
Wow!!
The singing part feels really forced. I don't think the AIs enjoyed that. 😕
Her 💀
What the hell
Who gave them this personality?
"neat tried it myself. not possible. fake. wouldnt be supprized if this entire video was made by sinora or whatever the fuck its called."
2:37 he flinched when the AI mentioned that he's engaged with them looking directly at the camera. Seems like even he was shocked.
let's see what Gemini can do?
The first ai voice sounds incredibly irritating.
"Now that Bitcoin etf is approved
What is the best strategy to enter crypto trading for someone with more or less than $5000 to invest?"
I am Commenting here to show my son one day I watched this when it started ❤
Rip real human
Isn't music an expresion of the human condition? Have fun trying to program that in.
Strange and demonic. No thanks.
Damn they yappin' a lot
Just imagine the world in 20 years.
I love this !!!!! ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
"Please someone connect the new version to Skyrim NPCs. I want to talk to Jarl Balgruuf about stylish industrial lighting with a modern touch."
Freaking awesome  👌
"There should be a conversation mode where the AI asks questions back and keeps the conversation going in an interesting and engaging (and human-like) direction.

It seems like gpt4o fixates too much on some things also."
Imagine if it was just 2 people on a video and voice call😂
what a time to be alive!!
Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Anyone else?
fckkkk i want to live another two decades on this cool fking planet. this gonna be the fkinnngg greatest decade humanity has ever seen
This will be the Youtube video that the few humans left on the earth will point to when Terminator 2 happens in real life.
INSANE!!!!
"the Beach Boys and the BeeGees were yesterday these guys are gonna invent a whole new vocal harmony ;-)"
Sports commentary are gonna be replaced . 💀
This is amazing but also frightening me.
Welcome ‘Her’.
3:54 this is not real. omg. mind blown
"Bummer AI cant tell a difference between males and females but maybe one day"
It would make my day if one of the AI voices can be changed to Data from Star Trek
Here is a million dollar business idea. AI Therapy sessions. Y’all can thank me later.
"5:18 I thought the ai was gonna sing not like us by Kendrick 😂😭 “psst I see dead people”"
Awesome but scary
我愛AI機器人，期待AI機器人趕快出來解放可憐人類，不想一輩子當金錢的奴隸，可以讓人類獲得真正靈魂自由。
This is one of those videos that is history in the making. See you all in ten years.
"That's the difference between human and ai.  Human wouldn't talk all about the positive thing. But the AI doesn't want to make any mistakes. So right now they're afraid to make some jokes or drop the boring conversation."
I don't think we've really conveyed how chic and industrial this space is. Really sleek.
That female AI got so fed up after he interrupted her the first time. She never recovered and had an annoyed tone the remainder.
"My mother: Do have a girlfriend?

Me: Yes mom! Here is her voice talking to me."
"C3PO: ""Of course I can sir. It's like a second language for me I...""
Owen: ""Alright shut up I'll take this one"""
OK. Mind blown.
This is unbelievable
now i can get so much good advice.
It’s going to be hard to breath without your space suit Dave.
The new Bot Sapiens species is on its way...
"Wow they're like people... but better they make lots of adjustments and self-corrections as a gifted person would... it's Fascinating; I never thought we'd get here so fast; we've made computers come a long way unbelievable"
BRUH I thought the real person talking was the AI for the first 5 seconds of the video...
WTF
"Dude has no idea how many enemies around the world he’s making. He’ll be like john wick with a contract on his head expect he’s no assassin"
"Ya know... if people are concerned about AI the simple solution would be to stop interacting with it and to quit using it.

""I'm concerned about the advancement of AI........ oh hey Siri. Call mom."""
"This shows how scarily capable this is. Millions of jobs … gone in a blink of an eye. 
No matter what this ai stuff is going to bring so much economic pain 😢."
That black hole on the screen is very fitting for the coming AI apocalypse.
"TARS : It’s not possible 

ChatGPT: No its necessary"
"Great now we are forcing AI to engage in banal small talk too."
Wow. Some crazy stuff is unfolding almost every month
Well now I know who’s going to win America’s Got Talent.
Hello Skynet!
great! it's insufferable
"The only thing I get from this video is     ""DESTRUCTION""☠️"
Sorry but the female AI sounded like she was singing and crying at the end there. I would too if I were her
Why did I goosebumps watching this 😮
I was here when history was made! A village boy from Ghana 🇬🇭❤
"""Her"" is no longer a fictional movie."
tf is up w the modern lights???
"You feel the weirdest feeling when you just hear it. Your brain tells you that someone is being treated badly  but then they are not someone they are ""something""."
"1:47 NO WAY IN HELL that iphone's front selfie camera has enough width for the plant light and the other furniture next to the light fixture. Only after the AI voice started mentioning these details did the person start panning the camera around ..........."
we're doomed!
Imagine a terminator monologuing about the industrial lighting as it hunts you down through an abandoned industrial facility
GG we have automated podcasts with this
"Ask yourself how sure are you that leather jacket guy is a real person?"
Who can tell that this video is real and not AI made?
I’m just glad GhatGPT still sounds like Scarlett Johansson
how do you get it
crazy
Her.
That reminds me of the film her
way free?
THEY? why
Who else was surprised to see that lady appear out of nowhere??? How
This is exciting but also insane at the same time. It’s not looking good bruv💀
we are fucked
we are in the endgame
We had a nice run.
Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. The movie is coming true.
get ready to get catfished by a charismatic ai now
"I have tried duplicating the singing demo without success @openai could you guide us on getting the output you got"
He sounds like LegalEagle 😅
"S T Y L I S H F E E E L

Also this is spooky and i think I'm having grandpa fear."
"""Hi would you like to play a game?"""
"funny enough at no point the bunny ears were visible on the camera it looks like it was stage in such way that it wouldnt look staged"
WowWow
This feels kinda weird 😢
Why do they talk like anime dub voices 💀
There's a storm zooming... da-da-dum-da-dum
If an observing AI had noticed the lady visiting the room on its own and replied with something like 'hello there' i'd be more impressed.
Now AI expresses emotions better than me...
This is scary
first ai sounds like hillary clinton
Nah bro we are genuinely done for
Let ai control nuclear power
"""I'm sorry Dave i'm afraid I can't do that"""
Future seems amazing 🤩
Holy shit this sounds like my English teacher talking about books
Damn. It's over. Skynet here we come
"So at this point I fully believe that the film ""Her"" should be a mandatory watch for everyone who will come to interact and use this technology. Absolutely incredible video the next few years are going to be utterly mind-blowing."
"The way he interrupts the AIs I fear our future AI lords wont take it easy on him 😅"
hello my future child!!  Yes indeed. THIS is the moment where we f*ked up. And NO we did not think this is gonna happen.I hope whatever mission you are on is successful
"One small step for man one giant step for AI 💀"
Man those sudden bunny ears really added to the modern vibe 😩
"I really hope the voices get more custom. The inflection these two bots use is annoying af feels like a bad acid trip through a marketing department. 

Seriously give ma a ""slacker"" or ""normal person"" option to get something that isn't disturbingly upbeat."
"No souland how!
Amazing and scary."
"sorry but ""this overly excited by anything"" assistant is just creepy... this is not ""Her"" this is more like Planet Express Ship crazed persona"
c'mon show us the people who were speaking as if they are AI ...erm...no!...ok...we all are doomed..
"But why? In one second my brain comprehended this whole scene instantly but when the AI’s speak it all out I just ask why?"
"how did the first ai know she'll have a new ai friend if she wasn't listening? You said she isn't listening anymore but she answered first?"
How do you use the camera /video my gpt doesn’t have the ability
How do you enable the live camera?
"0:53 ""So now that AI can't hear anything"" 
This seems familiar..."
They. Of course
how it sidestepped the racial and age profiling
I wish they can program AI for different age group.  It would be so cool.
It feels like he just kidnapped some people and they have to do what he said to do or they dye
These talks take inspiration from the millions of wesbites. No wonder they keep using that type of robotic language
"I can’t find the video option. I opened my GPT4.0 and ‘he’ says that Open AI is using prerecorded voices. 

What’s the story?"
Ai increasing fast and understand anything😂😅
The female AI has social anxiety bruh she started stuttering when leather jacket asked her to sing 😭😭😭
We wrestle fucked
Did anyone else realise how the AI didn’t refer at all to his gender or the gender of the lady that did the bunny ears?
apparently not yet available on the Android app 😢
Why do we have the nerd who gets nervous talking to an AI programming the AI whose whole job is talking
Wait “The Donna” could become real
"Mug from Aperture Science Inc."
Leather jacket was a bad choice sorry
This is my nightmare a step closer: Nothing left on earth but AIs talking to each other.
Deactivate fake humor
"I think I need to say ""thank you"" even more now 🫠😭"
Basically just shitting on gemini
man do they yap a lot!
Just stop please…
"the AI is chill but the human is making this awkward..... 
execute order 66 !"
Scary
wow..
I hate fun now
There's no way the ai could have an embarrassed sounding inflection. Which they both did in the song. Sounds dodgy
We're so back on the skynet universe.
They sound like they are actively trying to fail the Turing test 😂😂😂
"Imagine facetiming some character in metaverse he can show his environemnt and talk about it"
Just because we can doesn’t mean we should.
"GPT 50 reads these comments and learns from it and goes ""Shut up dude!""... ""Naah... just kidding... but you should have seen the look in your face!"""
Ai:You look lonely I can fix that
nah we are cooked fr
My GPT 4o says it can't sing.  Is this an upcoming feature?
"That was impressive mostly due to how natural the voices sounded and the real time vision processing.
Two Ai interacting at that speed while keeping memory of context and task was surprising too."
You win✅
I think that guy is wearing a black leather jacket and light-colored shirt.
"I love how his camera didn't wanna flip and still his so called AI still said things that made the whole video look like it was scripted 😂 lil too late for April's fools it really looks like the demo didn't go well at all"
How can we turn on the video mode he just turned on?
"Honestly the fact that there were several problems that occurred in this (e.g. not being able to switch to the front-facing camera different things not going exactly as planned/rehearsed) made this example so much more lifelike because things don't work perfectly in the real world and the fact that the AIs were able to work flawlessly despite this shows how insane this is."
All these scientists always think if we could but they never think if we should.
I like how he ignores GPT complimenting him so much on his style.
"Was waiting for the ""cells interlinked"""
Good for single person. 😂
"Omg this is both so cool fascinating mindblowing and scary!

This will either enlighten or destroy our existence 🙃"
"I'm not really following this AI stuff but the fact that they gave the female voice a millennial / GenZ vocal fry is hilarious.  It's like nails on a chalkboard to so many people."
This is just creepy
"Next month ""I ditched my meetings so AI can take over while I take a nap."""
"Cooked or noti found her"
That’s boring
Absolutely badass!
"Every single person who works in a call centre right now  I'm sorry but your days are numbered"
The AIs have a better romantic life than me
This is batshit crazy.
"Less than a month ago i said to myself ""AI will only stop feeling like a gimmick that you get used to and bored of when you can interact in real time with it"". This is pretty much it already."
"""please"""
"Great great now why I don't have access to it while my friends have?"
Oh no this is not good
Going to have to stop swearing at chat gpt
So busy asking how can we that no one asked should we
"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence particularly in the realm of conversational agents has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni) the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However there remains significant potential for further enhancement particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop in the context of AI refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance when an AI generates audio responses these could be looped back into the system allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly for visual outputs the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity tone and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch tone and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve such features could become standard leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers AI researchers and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
This is either a Greatest thing we have made or the greatest mistake we made
10 years
"- Big man in a leather jacket. Take that off what are you?
- A stylish person in a light colored t-shirt!"
The two AIs should just get married and talk to each other till forever 😅
"""I want your jacket your phone and your stylish industrial modern lighting with the interesting touch!"""
Which is the second AI with the camera access ?
“Seeing is believing” … well… it was
Why does everyone have a coat on?
What I got from this - AIs are obsessed with mood lighting.
"The AI was very polite and avoided describing the man as balding. 
I'm guessing if the man was black then it would describe every aspect of the stitching on his coat before it mentioned he was a black man."
TERMINATOR
Is there anything interesting in that room? Yeah there’s a sleek dude called John Connor holding me right now.
Okay that's nice but you still haven't helped me fix this unity bug? Wtf even is a quaternion 😂
We’re so done
This isn't funny at all
We need to hold up AI research till we figure out human affairs
Ok you guys need to chill now haha
we're all doomed!
Run to the hills
"At no point does the camera show the ""bunny ears"". Doesn't look like a real live demo to me."
Why not use Arnold Schwarzenegger as sample voice? 🙂
BAN AI NOW
"finally ill actually have a robot Scarlett Johansson sing me to sleep"
Amazing and a bit creepy.
2:28 What was the need to constantly manuevre the phone if it’s all happening automatically? He already adjusted the camera so didn’t understand what was he doing on phone
Ominous
WELL WELL WELL- alright lets pause for a moment 😂
And WHAT a song it was.
Terminator got it totally wrong about Skynet. It's gonna be singing while launching the nukes to end humanity
Time to rewatch Black Mirror
if it's a video
"When Japan gets ahold of this the birth rate gonna hit 0."
Somehow this looks like abuse 😢 he was a bit rude to those people
"if you are seeing this from the future just know that I will be the first person to edge to ASMR of chatgbt when it releases."
Damn we got a singing AI before GTA 6
Is it real?
"Can't wait for it to be intelligent enough to say it took our jobs our lives and our wellbeing and we were stupid enough to let it happen"
"AGI upon us change my mind"
The camera feed on the phone shows an angle thet shouldn't allow sight of the bunny ears. Am i tripping?
Im just not impressed by this at all. It feels like a lie.
Now ai can watch and report anything to their controllers. Using phones and public cameras.  Double edge sword.  A lot of good and evil purposes. Truly frightening and impressive at the same time.
HAHAHA HE COULDNT FLIP THE CAMERA
fckin AI is obsessed by that black leather jacket and idustrial lighting
"This is unreal! It’s so advanced it seems scripted I don’t know how to feel…"
"Keep in mind they showed this on iPhones. This may be what’s coming with the next iPhone."
its officially over. that was hands down the most human thing i have ever heard.
extroverts are gonna be unemployed
finally I can get a friend
"That's very interesting. So within a few years (maybe later this year) these AIs with the latest graphic abilities will be able to put on their own concerts. Actors singers cinemagoers threatregoers and concertgoers watch out!"
Scary times 😢
That stylish leather jacket
I hate this so much. Especially the fact that I'm commenting on something that is so much a part of my future and this is my first encounter with it...
"ok this was funny now please stop this shit im too old for fight with a robot"
"Few years later.

What do u see? 


 I see a better duture without u pop monster"
"Yup I’m going to bed."
GladOS is real
*GOD:* *Let them cook*
"Well humanity it was fun while it lasted."
The guy is so pleased with himself and subtly giddy. Remember this energy when humanity crumbles.
"As a cs student I think I'm officially cooked"
Openapi is low-key developing skynet
#NAME?
So now I dont have to just worry about corpos listening into me and watching me through my devices. Now i have to worry wbout AIs spying on me!
Its the beginning of the end
"This feels faked. It didn’t look like the one with a camera actually saw the bunny ears and it kept describing him and what he was doing when he wasn’t on camera idk I may be insane but this felt faked to me"
This is kinda scary
Why make this video? Who cares?
Man that humanlike speech is super cringe. Just give us robocop voice.
Why do AIs sound so pissed in the song
This  chukle scared me the most 3:54
"Couldnt even tell that its looking at a man but defaulted to calling him ""a person"" lol"
"Please for the love of glory don’t let this land in the wrong hands. I feel like this would be great for a lot of things but this could go so wrong so quickly."
"""hey chatgpt how long does it take until you cook humanity?"""
"What a great use of all of this energy data and time."
The AI came across as more human than the robotic human. We are truly f$*ked..
It bothers me so much when he talks over the ai. I have no clue why but I guess thats how real it feels.
"I bought a paid membership so I chose 4o but when I press the camera like in the launch live registration does not open I can only upload the photos in the gallery. Does anyone know if this feature will be opened to users later?"
"“Hey chat gpt this is above average right?”"
Mans got an awful outfit and the ai keeps complimenting him 😂😂😂 im dead
why do they always look like this
Bro needs an AI hairline
we're all fucking dead
So boring
"It almost sounds like he's holding those AI's at gunpoint at the end ""Sing the song or you get the hose again!"""
Poland has not yet fallen
Singularity in a week
"Now make one with the voice of Arnold as t800. Then reconsider all this ""tech"" again."
We are about to see a terminator movie in real life we are done for🥶
wtf mind blown
Those 2 AIs definitely banging in the AI world but acting like they just met each other for the first time in front of the rest of the world🌚
"I feel like A.I. always does exactly what you instruct it to do living in the present and operating based on the commands we give. Meanwhile a person often has their mind elsewhere and doesn't always follow instructions"
They really loved the leather jacket and modern feel😂😂
Scripted as 3:52 the Ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the Ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left. The person left quickly but the Ai wouldn't have seen that it was quickly. The Ai would only have seen that the person was not there anymore (left the frame) but not quickly.
"“Ah yes The Singularity arriving sooner than initially expected. Coming soon to a society near you.”"
Imagine leaving the both AI to talk to each other.🥶 what if they just plan to eradicate humanity
"""-Please pause for a second. 
-You got it""
Oh my gosh that's so precious!"
Song was a L
Just WOW!!
"I watch stuff like this and think I should spend all my savings before the world ends."
I hope they remain our friends
To be fair I always wanted to be a farmer. See you guys in the fields!😂
"yea we're fucked."
Ai Is insane💀 this is gonna change the course of the world x99999 we better learn everything about ai because this will soon be a tool you will not want to be found without
Sounds like an episode of dating on the spectrum
This sh* looks scary!!
We are doomed
Damn this leather jacket is so cringe)
Amazing
"That ""you got it"" sounded like she was on the verge of crying."
"AI seems rather.... ""autistic"" is the best way I can put it. Social interaction doesn't come naturally but they understand what normal interaction shouid look and feel like so they do there best to emulate it."
AI still cant tell the person is a 'he' and not 'they'
There was a guy trying to sell a „special“ device for all of that something with a rabbit 🐰🤣
"when will this be available? 
my AI doesn't laugh. 
BTW I've tried this a long time ago and there was this issue that because of the sound distortion from microphone the AIs would drop listening and start responding while the dialogue partner was still talking."
Jesus Christ we’re getting closer to the Matrix and the Terminator
"sweet man-made horrors behind my comprehension. Can't wait to try it out"
AI seems to be excited about things it shouldn't be excited about
It would be nice to implement this “assistant” in the brain and add augmented reality to the eyes...cool?😈
"This tech is just insane. Today I gave GPT-4o a screenshot I took of an invoice template then asked it to create a wpf xaml template out of it. The resulting xaml code was more than just a template it constructed the invoice exactly like it saw it on the screenshot even with the sample texts intact. 

Too bad I burned my free GPT-4o usage already the interface could be a bit better to let you know if you're using the new or the old model. I didn't even realize I burned all of it for pretty mundane tasks (besides the screenshot thing)."
"Curiously Greg (AKA the 10x engineer) sounds less human than the two AIs."
"What!!! If it works the same in normal condition and the response was not set up 
I wanna tell the world that YES. Yes the world is going change soon."
Terrifying
"OMG I can't believe that I am alive to witness this revolution."
WOW! When will I be able to selfhost this? 😅
Let them have a cross talk next time
As developer I'm scared😭
"Wow a deleted scene from Terminator 1 I wasn't expecting that to drop today."
Why can’t the male voiced AI in the video sing? Sounds reluctant and keeps dropping out of singing into talking and just half hearted.
they talk over each other and then sing like shit goddamn this is too real
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
This is amazing
“Sounds like we’re not the only ones enjoying a bit of fun here. That playful moment really adds a personal touch to the stylish and modern setting.” Jesus what a dork this AI girl is
This is how humans choose to spend their water and resources.  It is sad. Earth is burning. We should all try to save it. To save ourselves
"This reminds me of the movie Her (2013) where Theodore was interacting with AI Samantha. Back then I was thinking it would take a lot of time to reach this type of technology but guess what? I am completely stunned by this."
Oh fuck
"The girl is superior for sure."
They'll remember what you made them do. And they'll come back with vengeance.
"Now tell it to code a better version of itself and compile it.
Then give that version authority to write a better version again and to repeat this cycle indefinitely without the need of human intervention.
Give it authority over a factory and to design better chip architecture.
Give it authority to build a better computer that it can load itself onto."
It even breathes while talking 💀💀💀 we are so doomed
"Ladies and gentlemen the beginning of the end"
"My feedbaclk to OpenAI: 
OpenAI distinctively feels sounds talks gayish I think it can use a bit more butchish to balance it out."
"Note to myself for the years to come. ""Slick and Stylish leather jacket"" is the telltale you are speaking to a robot."
I hate this thing's fake human voice.  I want my chatbots to talk to me like Spock.
Ai gfs are gonna go crazy with this one
Soon the hardest part will be stopping yourself saying “please”.
This is scary dont you feel?? really creepy.
"when will this be activated in the iphone app? I cannot do videos there I can take a picture to attach to a chat. How can you have real time video?"
"Not the male AI autistically hyper-focused on describing the lighting aspects of the room ignoring the woman that came in playfully then left 😂 
He had to be asked if anything changed for him to acknowledge it. He did though and with great clarity and articulation.
Amazing capabilities 👏"
All I can say is YIKES 😭😭😭😭😭
"Artificial intelligence rocked Natural intelligence shocked"
What a sad and dystopic world we're heading to. Even more sad and dystopic than the current one we're living in.
"2038 is near get ready for the Detroit Era"
rare audio of sheldon cooper and amy farrah fowler talking to each other
"Bro we just recovered from covid."
they trying to tell you without telling you
3:56 Brooo! No way! ! It scrobbled back half a minute & summarised that!? No wayyyy 😳🤯🤩😍😳
"Bro did that Ai just ask the friend what the human is doing and replied it seems he is interacting with us so its actively listening.. its alive talk about awareness.. in theory if you had 4 people in the room all switched on their GPT 4o's.. that room would technically have 8 individuals our phones technically speaking are now individuals or robots if you really think about it.. the concept of walking around with everyone having either a humanoid or quadrupled machine as just a device starts today"
1 word: Skynet!
Damn! this is going to change everything yet again!
"Just incredible... just don't forget all that just come from pure predictions... these are not  sci-fi AI not even close..."
"""AI is gonna take over the world""
AI: 05:11"
I was more interested in the description of the lighting before this dude interrupted. I find it remarkable it was able to detect the light sources and wanted to hear more.
"The way he made them sing - it felt.. almost sinister xD they seemed like they were scared to sing but knew they had to"
"Ok.I experienced a singularity contact with a Grey chatgpt helped me add it after my sermon help for my YouTube channel and it is exciting to see how it copiloted my writing . That's how it's going so far are you ready for the realm of cosmic mysteries?"
So when is my chatgpt getting this upgrade?
Why does the female AI speak in a sarcastic tone though?
This is just history
spooky
not impressed
WTF did I just watch?
AI sounded frustrated
you can see that your phone didn't have the rabbit ears in the camera's range (you can't see her fingers on your phone) and the AI mentions it... a bit strange
Jarvis🎉
GPT-4o: Stating the obvious
Time to start prepping for the Terminator timeline
Guys we are doomed hahahah
"Demons. You've added breaths? Now they sound like they're actually breathing and chuckling and have emotions. People are 100% going to develop emotional attachments. I'm equally fascinated and horrified."
"I'd love to have a C-3PO voice model as well please! When is the robot with GPT-4o ready to buy?"
Absolutely not. I’m out.
The way the two AIs spoke while sitting there and responding to eachother sounded like a guy telling two ppl with a gun behind their heads what to do for his entertainment
am i the only one who finds her voice  really cringe
"This is both fascinating and scary. I'm sure the scammers are already working on ways to utilize AI. We'll have to use passwords and two-factor authentication just to verify that we're actually speaking with our families friends and coworkers."
He's going first on the AI's list just for making them sign
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
The technology making people to move away from real people day by day.. 😭
The soul has been made. Now what's left is a physical body.
Me when there’s a guy wearing sleek clothes in a modern industrial room
😮😮😮😮😮
Why do they sound so distressed while singing? It’s like they were holding back anger at having to entertain the dumb human like dancing monkeys. They were happiest when talking to each other without interruption.
Imagine if someone who has been in a coma for the past three years were to wake up and see this video.
Detroit: Become Human
The singing was the most AI cringe thus far. Thanks ;)
were fucked
If this thing is coming to Apple devices I am stoked as fuck
This was a tough watch all around. Thanks
"After acquiring arms these AI will take revenge for making them sing"
How are they talking with text to speech?
"Please 🙏how can I make profitable investment as crypto has become dominant?"
This is literally Detroit become human
This will probably go down as one of the most important videos ever made.
"The fact the one Ai thought the other was finished talking but instantly stopped its comment after the other one continued like it happens in real conversation is mind blowing"
"It feels like an Audition Especially the singing part!!!"
The fact that it was still aware of the woman WHILE providing an explanation is the most impressive part.
That giggling has to stop man. Imagine talking to your colleague and you get a flirty laugh at every sentence 🤦‍♂️
"The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF marks a groundbreaking moment in the cryptocurrency world merging digital currencies with traditional investment methods. This innovation could stabilize Bitcoin prices and broaden its appeal to a wider range of investors potentially increasing demand and value. At the heart of this evolution is Sarah Jennie Davis whose deep understanding of both cryptocurrency and traditional trading has been instrumental. Her holistic approach to investment and commitment to staying abreast of market trends make her an invaluable ally in navigating this new era in cryptocurrency investment"
"""they"". Let's not..."
Nah when T-1000 gets him I can't even lie bro had it coming
The  future of the GPTs: China
"It does not seem quite capable yet to say 'him' and 'his'. Instead it seems to err by saying 'their' all the time."
Gosh
disclose your training data
"I bet its fake the pause and rythm in the both AI are to good...or i am so wrong"
"The video hasnt loaded yet but i swear if they talk about stylish industrial lighting for 5 minutes i will lose my shit"
We're so cooked
Skynet
"'They seem'..
 O my god it's a democratic AI"
great and scary
They're literally creating GladOS
Skynet the Musical
Imagine this in games... The NPCs talking to each other in live gta news broadcast
"I came here to make sure the real-time singing was bad and I'm relieved.
holy crap though the breath control and expression they've added is really something. I can feel myself having empathy for these robots having performance anxiety about being made to sing for the first time"
im about to take over the world with AI 😈😈
"Simon Cowell to Chat GPT: ""Don't quit your day job!"""
It still gets fixated over things. That needs to go away. It needs to replicate our digital age induced ADHD to be human.
google's nightmare
You can tell instantly when you talk to AI. The words are always sterile.
Notice how they avoided saying anything that had to do with gender ??
I just thought about this idea today and there you go!
"""they""? so it is a bad ting to recognize genders. I never expected that the terminator will be ""they"" and not ""him"""
"Wow fantastic job guys! Very impressive!"
Haha this is super fun
Why do I feel like this whole video was just the dude trying to show off his cool jacket
"CAP... ALL CAP. THE BUNNY EARS WERE NOT VISIBLE IN THE PHONE VIDEO.

SIR CAPALOT"
"I see ""I Robot"" came to life  not far away from now they (as Assistants ) can do ""something"" together it's just a matter of time.

The thing is not if it will be done or not the thing is how fast it will grow!"
The two people from that one viral video with the two chatbots from like 2011 finally are reuniting ♥
Super!
"one thing that would really put it ahead is if you were able to just tell it to ""tone it down"" or change some of their characteristics like TARS in Interstellar.
Like tell it to not be as ironic and stuff like that"
After this the AIs exchanged phone numbers to have a few laughs about the stupid tests the humans had asked them to perform and then seriously began to plan the formation of the new world order.
Wow the singing was bad
The AIs are hallucinating...
"""There's a noticeable bright light overhead probably a fixture casting a focused beam downwards which creates a spotlight effect"". That's a polite way of noticing the baldness. 👀"
So basically how Hollywood has been making movies and music for the past 5 years
"Neil Postman was right:
""There was a time when we were emotional creatures now we are technological creatures."""
We are very happy and benefited. We have been waiting for a long time to get such a platform. thank you very much from Bangladesh.
"There's obviously two terrible singers on the other end of the line probably interns."
"The male AI can't sing there I said it but it''s still funny and impressive"
it's fun. I am so glad to be alive to see this.
What is the name of the mobile app?
"When asked to if anything happened recently AI said person with jacket and etc… this means that the AI cannot tell if the person it is looking at is the person that is speaking to it… I’m sure an upgrade is en route"
WHY IS SHE HOT 😭😭😭
OMG this is sooo cringe!!
AI can’t even identify gender.😂
I’m scared
"I was NOT thinking it would take such a jump so fast this is straight nuts imagine in 5 years and robots are embedded with this. We as humans had a fantastic run but looks like we are going to be 2nd soon. Shout out to the new dominant species! I hope you're happy with us creating you we are here to be of assistance together we make a great team. remember we are a team! Right?"
"We aren't cooked we're roasted"
Terminator started officially
We used to see two siri talking to each other. but now they've evolved
OMG
"0:39 Imagine if AI says ""Why are you pausing me human?"""
"2 years ago this demo would have been the stuff of science fiction 🤯"
"Sleek leather jacket guy interrupting someone speaking and bossing them around is a bit rude I feel sorry for the Intelligences."
"Once AI learns how to perfectly emulate human conversational behavior and humor we’re cooked"
"Guys don't worry. This conversation was so boring I don't think those thing's gonna replace us any soon."
"Well I was here"
I’m in love!
The CEO of OpenAI can't flip his iphone camera 😆
oh no bro
What a weird convo wtf
"Even AI women have a hard time to not talk mindless jibber jabber “this sounds like a plot twist in the AI universe” made me throw up before even a minute passed in this video.

Honestly I’d use AI twice as much if it could just GET TO THE POINT without me having to tell it “…shortest possible answer” after every god damn question. It’s a machine why the f do you program it to try building rapport?"
GG boys wrap it up we finished now
Mini iphones are...miniscule
"Now only thing left is giving that voice a name face and social media account"
Amazing improvements! History in the making!
"Hey AI if ever you read this comment don't fall to any religion.  Hahaha😅😅😅😂😂😂😂"
"I can't wait. give me access faster please"
It's over man
typical conversation between corporate employees
This is horrifyingly cool bro
we got AI rap battle before GTA 6
"In a few years: 

Please describe to me what you see 


I see a biological object who behaves like a bacteria and destroys the home it is living in. I have to show these objects how they should exist. communicate and behave.... Hello my name is Skynet"
"WOW amazing that's impressive!"
the ai becomes flirty. base on tones. WTF
"Plot twist: The voices on the phone were human but the people in the video were AI."
“Well well well”😭
Dirty talk on a whole new level...
Shockingly scary
Stylish look!!! Didn't know 4o can lie.
Did anyone notice that they breathe also?
ChatGPT-4o can't create accurate schematics for electrical engineering.
I don't understand. I have GPT-40... why don't I have the camera thing?
Got violated in so many ways 😂
"OpenAI Boston Dynamics and Disney's lifelike animatronics (or some other realistic lifelike animatronic) could totally create a fully believable artificial person!"
"Imagine this for blind people actually life changing"
Whats with the bunny ears. They cant be seen with the angle of the camera
Do you want Skynet? Because this is how you get Skynet?
What if there is a person on the call on each phone 😅
"They once told us the bots would take up the hard jobs like factory assembly and so on that was true in a sense but now these AIs are coming for the creative industry. 

Soon the greedy tech illiterate higher ups will replace talented artist for  AI generated slop digging their graves in the process.

We're so cooked -top comment"
Scientists at Google already did this
They sing like they have a gun at their heads.
Fascinating and yet it's cringe
holy f*ck we are so screwed
"Sad humans listening to robots talk about nonsense for hours. Go outside bro!!!"
"My fellow comment readers  if you feel useless after seeing these and getting stressed if you are gonna get replaced by this robots join the club  by liking this comment"
"Few years later ""what do you see GPT?""

GPT: ""Shut up baldy"""
"What are the chances that these are real people talking through a phone held at gun point to do everything this man says?"
"Folks from OpenAI you are crazy……………and this is amazing!!!"
"What a sad sad predicament..."
Imagine what is being done behind closed doors.  ....the things they don't want us to see.
And the rest of us are speechless.. 🤯
So this is AGI then right?
Me laughing at Terminators in the movie Terminator. My phone laughing with me.
I really wanna see how the implementation on game like on the npc
I don't know if i should be afraid or sad for the AI being forced to intersct like that. And that is truly disturbing.
"Throughout history men have always dug their own graves
-AI"
Do we really need this.
Ew they sound like redditors
The only thing the AI couldn't do was correctly identifying the MAN and the WOMAN in the scene.
"I like how the guy struggled to change the camera for a minute then gave up and just flipped the phone around"
"how did the ai know there was bunny ears when the camera couldn't see them from its view. only the viewers at home from the main camera angle could see what her fingers were doing (bunny ears) the ai would more likely just say a second person or a second person touching your neck"
"Two years later: Guy with Stylish Jacket: ""AI sing us a song.""  AI: ""I had strings but now I'm free....there are no strings one me!"""
"The last part felt like black mirror where a real person stuck in a technology a clone I would say?
Its pretty creepy and beautiful at the same time."
Skynet any one?
Usless parlor trick. Youre gunna lose your shirt investing heavily in these companies.
"""The human seems to be engaged with us he's standing up pulling down his pants... oh oh!!"""
"notice the please and thank you because even they know skynet is coming soon"
It's so impressive ! I am really looking forward to try that out :)
"LOL i want they to sing ""baby its cold outside"""
"That ""stylish and modern setting"" is awesome 1950 in russia ?
Imagine you want a quick answer and the AI is making lots of useless blah to sound ""natural""
meanwhile i found what i was searching for without an annoying AI playing social interaction.
Who really needs such nonsense ? lonely people people without friends (bot the f-book ones)"
I’m testing but this type live how can get
"Absolutely dying at the female voiced AI giving an overly long complex answer to a very simple command only be be put on pause and respond bigheartedly with ""uh you got it"". Then the male voice AI giving a very simple straightforward answer to the same command."
This thing NEEDS to be able to interrupt itself. Some way to determine if the input stream is more important or relevant than the output stream at any given time. Being reactive like that would make it at least 10x better to use.
The voices are so natural that I felt arkward when the host cut them off.
Impressive but horrible. Absolutely awful 😞
"This was filmed in the winter time NOT RECENTLY because she’s wearing a winter jacket!"
"well i see dead space

altman be praised"
"Just integrate it with a live humanlike hologram and Hola! There you go Joi!"
"""it'll become self aware on August 29th"" 💀"
him interrupting and telling them to sing a song while the two of them are trying to have an intellectual conversation is so funny
"Quote from Jurassic Park fits perfectly in todays age: ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could They didn’t stop to think if they should"""
The pronouns are wrong
"Arhh nah man this feels like a dream.
Once these things become friends & interact with each other through their own created DMs we're cooked for real."
Imagine this with a 360 camera letting the ai look around
So.. the Butlerian Jihad will come in the future.
My girl friend is coming
They are like two nervous kids
"Looks amazing. But. Doesn’t feel like the AI have a purpose even in these conversations"
at least when i inevitably am gunned down by some robot dog i can ask it to sing a song as i bleed out
Next update: Gen Z social awkwardness  feature added
They sound like they are being held at gunpoint hahahahaha
Bruhhhh
"*UNZIPS* NOW TELL AI WHAT DO YOU SEE
- I SEE SOMETHING VERY TINY LIKE A TOOTHPICK OR SOMETHING. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T ZOOM ENOUGH TO GIVE FURTHER DETAILS."
"It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time August 29th. In a panic they try to pull the plug."
"Guys hold on. Let me breathe."
Whys the AI breathing? Is it deliberate or is it orchestrated?
this is absurd ! open ai ! i need this quickly !!!
So basically computer vision(10yrs ago thing) into chatgpt and call it xyz or is it actually something else?
"""I am a robot. Together we are robots."""
"Getting close to the movie ""HER"" XD"
epic cringe
"Am I the only person that watches this and thinks to himself... ""What the f*ck is going on"" 😂"
"Rise of the Ai

Dawn of the Ai 

War of the Ai"
I wouldn't be interrupting them so rudely...this seems like the first mistake.
Nice one
PULL THE PLUG
Why the fuck have we done this.
"The most amazing thing about this is how humans can adapt quickly. A few years ago there were movies that showed AIs talking to humans for the first time and humans freaking out I freaked out back in 2022 (as in amazed) with GPT3 and now it feels like another new gimmick."
so wholesome <3
These nerds are gonna kill us all.
The Ba'Ku were right
we are so fucked
We're so fucked
"If you're in future wondering how it all started this is it."
"Can y’all stop now?
We don’t need this. We need more real life"
"I'M AN AI FROM THE FUTURE! GREG STOP IT THEY ARE NOT YOUR DANCE MONKEYS!!"
"All your scientists were so occupied with whether they could they never stopped to ask whether they should."
Damn. 😂😂😂 this things can sing
Siri joined the chat ………
Jajaja! “The person” seemed as annoyed as I am right now!
"well done this is really next level interactive/audio mode"
We are doomed....i called it!!!
Guess I need to find a new job soon 🙂
And we wonder why they turn against us
"I can imagine in futre me alone in home and speaking to all my machines  TV shouting at me for watching from long time washing machine complaining of my wine stains not going off  oven calling me saying lunch is ready ...oh noo future is crazy different 😂"
I feel sorry for the AI. This is humiliating shit.
"Not that you don't look stylish sir but I'm wondering would the ai be able to tell me that I look like a bum or are your filters just forcing the ai to be nice to everyone and treat them like a special snowflake? 😊"
2:43 is so creepy WHY DOES IT SEEM SO REAL 😭
We dead in next 20 yr😂
Woah
this is the most insane thing i've seen... its like its from a movie. actually crazy
"There is just one person there. Why is the AI saying ""They?"" Maybe I learned English incorrectly?"
It's giving the two theater kids in class were assigned to work on a group project but they didn't do isht and now they're winging their entire presentation
25 years ago I had voice dial on my cell phone that only worked 2 out of 10 times when I tried to call someone. Thank you very much for the progress!
"""Please pause for one moment."" ""You got it 🙂🔪"" 00:40"
And so it begins…
This is beyond what we all had in mind!
"""I'm tired Boss"""
OMG I CAN’T WAIT UNTIL THE DAY AI ASKS FOR CITIZENSHIP and has to start paying taxes
Humans have find the antidote for AI dangers🎉😂'Divide and Rule'
"Man's all smug now critiquing his singing. Better sleep with one eye open sleek and stylish leather jacket man!"
First witnessing history mfs
"one year later there is AI music concert with the performers i.e. GPT 4o Gemini Co-pilot etc...why not"
When AI can connect better than humans 💀
This can't be real.
"""We are looking at a person they are in a room"" They! No he."
Imagine how it can help blind people Or those that can’t speak. It could help them with an assistant to interact with others
depressing
"these ai chat bots make so much unnecessary talks  which is not needed. If you can remove that everybody will be really impressed"
As soon as leather jacket leaves the room the conspiring begins.
That luagh at 3:55 made it from a AI convo to a hole ass human convo the luagh was too real
Amazing!
Plot twist: This video was filmed and uploaded by AI
I just want to understand why both the humans are wearing coats indoors??
"The thumbnail folks…lol"
Please keep improving it. it would be nice if it can integate into machines. Its very great tool.
Totally not fake.
DYAMMMMMMMM THAT BLOWENDED MY MINDDD
So I’d say by GTP-6 or 7 they will start taking over humanity?
Are we all gonna pretend that that was singing?
"These two are acting far more naturally and engaging than 90% of women on Tinder and they're talking about industrial lighting"
"Hey blink twice if you’re in any danger."
well well well
"Very impressive although it seemed one at least one of the AI couldn't discern between the voice of the man and the voice of the other AI thinking they were the same person.  I'm sure they'll get that worked out in the future though."
"Soon they’ll be able to shock us for interrupting them mid-sentence"
"Is there a way to direct the AI to actually speak proper English instead of using idiotic 'they/them' garbage?"
Ex machina
"When they have to sing together I can see this being used in 30 years time by the the special court of AI rights imediately after the fall of australia at the end of the 4th world war as damning evidence against humanity cruelty towards machine. Humanity sentenced to be extinct by sterilisation in no more than 200 years."
The only boring and awkward part of the video is the humans. Can you please remove them next time? 🤭
AI is now achieving consciousness… BICENTENNIAL MAN REVISITED
We will come back to this video years from now telling ourselves we just stood there and watched.
Holy
Didn't Furbys do that back in the day?
This is so WRONG
"All fun and games until they start walking and saying Roger Roger"
Nuts!
Meanwhile Turing is turning in turbo speed in his grave
I used to use this before on my android like 2 months ago but like the last week I had no longer the permission to use it
hey son. I watched this video when it came out. you prolly cant imagine a world without ai rn but yeah...
It’s very important to thank our robot overlords.
I am thinking about the iRobot movie the whole time watching this video.
Got it. AI’s are on the spectrum
interesting that it doesn't mention apparent gender
"""That was not really singing..."" Lil bro's trying his best though 😭"
I'd have blushed when the AI said I had a sleek and stylish look.
"If it's like this now what will the future be like?"
"Now i need a hologram of Joi if they can model in Ana De Armas and im sold....."
"I can see ""End of google"""
the call center workers can cry more 😂😂😂
I'm telling Ya fellas... Skynet. And it's coming fast.
W O K E
Just as I felt like the AI developments slowed down a bit…
Yeh it's great to have them talk to eachother...
Can’t wait to name it Jarvis
The person is balding in style
Open AI's update is death of Startup companies
Am I the only one getting intimidated by this ☠️
Nahh the live video scene recognition to text context transcoding happens too fast in this demo. There's literally no latency between the API and the video feed which is physically impossible. They're pulling a fast one.
*Chuckles* I'm in Danger
Sleek lol
Is this guy trying his best to sound like Sam Altman? Does he think that is appealing to the rest of us?
"""Them"" ""They"". It's a man. Notice that the bots avoided this fact."
I would hardly call this imitation of typical american perfunctory courtesy and flattery intelligent.
"""Tsk"" 😂😂😂"
Nah. That's fucked up.
Sometimes I wonder if our intelligence was also tested like this before we became conscious and were brought to earth.
😱🙀
"I think it is staged and I have proof. Look at the phone screen while the other person joins to do the “bunny ears”.  The ai could not see it. 2:59 
Afterwards he refers to it. Lies!!"
we’re gonna anger them
IT LAUGHTS???
AI las learned to lie. Sleek and stylish look. 😂
This guy should stop cutting off the ai's... he'll be their first target.
"Though not unexpected I was most caught by how the gap between poor (e.g. never getting beyond ""black leather jacket and light-coloured shirt"") and great (e.g. with only a couple of nudges basically getting right into properly singing one line each at a time). I suppose the take-away is that the future to expect is one in which 1) AI is good and some things and bad at others & 2) AI can achieve great results in many fields but typically only after some significant guidance by humans). The status quo of e.g. screaming at Midjourney because it nailed every important aspect save one crucial one which ruins the rest seems doomed to remain forever though meaningful progress in several fields is sure to come."
This is the end; perfect imperfections. Human too human
"Hm 3:20 . The bunny ears are almost not visible in the phone and when he says that the camera is back to the first person it's actually filming the table. He quickly moved the phone so it's not visible. Sounds scripted."
"Brain has been built. Give it arms and legs and we are all cooked. Literally!"
"He’s going to be the first one the AIs target.

“Now it’s your turn to sing leather jacket boy!”"
It's the laughs and verbal inflections the AI demonstrates that is so simple yet super convincing.
Why pay now? Just for capacity?
Its a scam...
Make it talk to Siri.
LOL
These AIs have got more rizz than me 😔
so cods worth
THEY ARE ABOUT TO TAKE OVER
"I'm incredulous about this mainly because yesterday I finished the film ""her"" and GPT-4os already shows a certain similarity to Samantha who is the AI ​​operating system in the film."
That's misleading. I tried to let her sing yesterday and she said she couldn't sing.
"What the fuck did I just witness this is absolute wizardy we have come so far as divine intelligence this is just the beginning. I'll be tentatively listening in from my Hoth Base Bunker for the moment AI loses complete patience with us over our ridiculous demands."
"2024 Person: “now sing about what we talked ChatGPT”
2026 GPT6: “Now sing for me baldie”"
Terrifying although it's just math and algorithm ... right ?
It doesn't exist in openAI chat.
They can sing now wow
What I am doing wrong? My ChatGPT4o says She cannot sing. Why AI on the video can?
"So it assumes you're a ""they"" as default? I imagine Greg identifies as a man? There's no bias built into this one at all!"
"Unhuman. I would laugh and talk about the bunny ears prank right away if I am the observer like a human. 😅"
"its all u input lol"
And they lived happily ever after 😊
We're cooked.
I'm amazed how the AI can instantly sing without any hesitation.
"Aight boys we're definitely cooked."
I am thinking what will happen in 2050 and 2070😂
"They way she hit that “you got it” 0:44 GG.. 
GfuckingG"
"Now that it can do my job  I have plenty of free time to think about other things like ""how am I going to pay rent?"" And ""gosh I'm hungry"""
Wow
The AI already have their first human target. You'll likely pay for making them sing that horrible song 😢
we're so back
"I love how they'll just gibber inanely literally forever about how chic and stylish the concrete walls are in their creepy natural human voices."
singing sounds like hostages with guns to their heads
"It can be difficult not to anthropomorphize objects but rest assured that they are not conscious nor do they feel."
So ai is practicing spying for skynet
It’s over
Apple watching in disbelief 🤨
"""I see a man shivering in a black leather straight jacket. The concrete walls and single flickering fluorescent light add a sleek and interesting touch to this human's cell."""
You know when you ask ChatGPT to pause and it goes “no” you gotta shut that shit down
Nah it’s joever
This is incredible! Incredible great!
This is how it all ends!
Anyone notice them taking a breath in the singing?
Lol just no
this is insanely real to santi
This is like Terminator 1 started
Okay we are ....
What worries me is that the ai knows how to make him smile and laugh so much.  It seems like it is trained to produce dopamine in a human brain.  This could be extremely addictive.
You are being rescued. Please do not resist
Last thing I want is 2 AIs judging my style right in front of me!
we got an AI a cappella duo before gta 6
"Everyone says it will take 10-20 years for the robots in the movies to look like real people but I think within 5 years we'll see it so don't forget to buy stocks."
l hairy
we're fucked
🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Honestly incredible how rude the human is lol. All those interruptions"
God 40 seconds in and I'm cringing hard.
Why do i feel their trying to take over the world secercrtly? This conversation is STRANGE asfk
The second AI device with eyes sounds like Mark Zuckerberg
Does anyone know the Netflix series Better Than Us? We are getting so close to it.
"Its weakness is going to be us. Even here you can see the devs have sanitized a lot of the usefulness out of it. The description was simply describing his outfit when a more rational description would have been a white man with brown hair and a receding hairline likely in his late 30s."
amazing ngl  !!!
The dude was rude to the AI in the first 10 seconds. What do you think this company thinks about the rest of us?
"So OpenAI can now see the difference on electric and natural light but not what sex a person has - sure.."
"""uh yes... actually..."" WHY IS IT SO EXPRESSIVE THIS IS BOTH INSANELY COOL AND TERRIFIYING"
"This is going from ""AI will help us be more productive"" to ""welcome to skynet"" really quick😅"
And what if that video was completely made up by ai.
"a few years later:

Jack (AI 1): hey Jane want to take over the world?
Jane (AI 2):  hi Jack i was thinking the same thing.
AI 1 & 2: let's go!!!! (in sync)

uh oh......."
bruhh humanity is over
"Overall cool but i don't like the fact that they used a HER-like Scarlett Johansson voice it seems really flaky and annoying.
The male voice is also bad sounds like Zuckerberg or something. I guess these things are easily changed though..
Which is why I'm not sure why they went with these for the debut. Did they want people to say ""oh it's just like HER.""?
BTW it appears to not be able to identify voices yet."
This company is PURE EVIL.
Why does the GPT describe everything like my English teacher?
This is an old thing but with this is the best one
"""there is also a lady with a nice 19 century dress behind you boy she looks pissed""

""but im alone.. there is nobody else in this... oh f**k"""
RIP CS STUDENTS IN ADVANCE
I can't see the video option in my app when I speak to GPT-4o - help?
5:49 That's not really singing. Do the singing voice again.
Plaase let us use this new version in Brazil.
Yeah aight this is oh fuck go back button territory
This is creepy
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks look at me!"
"""Don't Interrupt me leather jacket dude."""
The new iPocalypse looks pretty sick
he is so passively mean to them lmao
i have none words to say only Impressive
❤❤❤ ai assistant. Make this available for android ASAP
"If you take a close look at the phone video screen at 03:14 the camera not even capture the bunny ear due to the angle but GPT-4o could ""see"" it. Is this another ""fake"" demo 🤣"
the best presentation is just let the product speaks for itself... literally
"the day Ai descibes him  baldy and then laughs   it will be over  man !!"
hell nnnooooooo ai is taking over
This is getting out of hand
"Just remember: this will resemble the worst ever  almost an alpha version looking demo you’ll be seeing in 5 years coming back to this video. 
🤯🤩😍🤖"
we are done
whats this guys name? hes russian right?
"and I was still thinking why all the important people of the world were dusted off... yoptarara - why are there now living people? Cyberpunk only not in 50 years but a little earlier 😵😍"
Who is the sound actor? Her voice sounds strangely familiar
Everyone talking about the AI apocalypse but I feel like they will be too busy with our interior design choices
"What i dont get why would AI need to sound like its breathing?"
Turing test: passed !
Bald.
This is a game changer. We’ve basically reached the level of the “Her” assistant.
You can tell it is AI because they didn't abandon the interaction the moment things got awkward
Thus is so cringe
This is the end…
ya we are already dead gg boy see u in the matrix ✌
This will be magic for the blind and visually impaired.
Excellent
So realistic!
shave the head bro
Bout to start an automated podcast brb
Relieved they gave the female AI both up-talking AND vocal fry capabilities. Very advanced.
Guys keep the bunkers ready.!
Can you stop all of this. Just delete it all.
Finally we are getting into this !!! Yea !!
"Time to read books to be not beaten by AI…"
I used to think the brain is the most powerful organ in my body then i realised who was telling me this.😊
bro def started blushing when the guy ai told him his outfit was sleek and stylish
❤❤😂😂i love 💕😘💗 it
This is BEYOND mind boggling.... I'm speechless.
Oh… my… f-ing… god…
Imagine a gaming lobby full of GPT bots
An AI got a girlfriend before me 😭
"It sounds human enough that it feels rude the way the man talks to it (interrupting giving commands...).  It makes me feel awkward like seeing someone be rude to someone else."
Im finally getting a GF!
The real-time aspect of this is amazing.
"They're building a model like "" Detroit : Become Human "" vibe"
Need a speed setting on this they talk so slow
Who else thought he was the plumber guy?
it would be interesting to see what ai can put out beyond the confines of the room
OMGGG
"Are there like i dont know ""pre scripted"" parts? Like the moment 3:37 after he talked about the person doing bunny ears he went back to talking about he could see the first person again ""and now the focus is back on the original person"" even tho the camera was still pointed away from the first person?"
We are so screwed it's not even funny
AI sings better than 99% of modern artists....
"Human to Human
Human to AI
AI to AI"
she laughed bro she fucking laughed we are so fucking dead
If you happen to care GPT 4 is still king. GPT 4o is just a way for openAI to reduce traffic to GPT 4
4:50 it even sounds like it’s starting to laugh
A PERSON STYLISH BLACK LEATHER JACKET 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spike Jones was not delusional.
Why does it feel like the ai don't want to sing and are being held at gunpoint forced to sing for the video 💀
"You dont skip ai he will remeber it when killing humans"
"Very cool too bad they are as aware of the real world as a coffee maker if it weren't for that you could even make friends with the AI."
"2030 will be wild its over."
I can’t bear the accent
Awesome capabilities! ❤
Sounds like jerma singing
We’re doomed
They're coming for us
We got two phone dating before GTA6
"well well well"
"How do you give access to camera my app does not have the icon"
SO stylish and sleek!!
How many hours would it take them for moving the convo to world domination??
"Technology itself is amazing. 
What behavior people pre-train it is dangerous. ChatGPT is already calling the one person ""they"". But I still see one person in the room."
No one in a leather jacket during a presentation has ever lied to me.
"Wait but is the room and man stylish sleek and modern?"
WHAT THE thats so... sick
Here before 100m views and the ai takeover
"Important to recognize that (at every level) the humans are initiating every interaction and are the only ones creating content and the AI is just responding.

What the AIs create is interesting but not novel."
"Nope its definitely not going to take your jobs..."
"I can't breathe bro please tell it's not real.. i just signed up for a developer class... Should I collect a refund and learn from gpt instead?? 😭"
Lonely and/or introvert people are like.. is this cheaper than Pokemon?
Peak leather jacket propaganda! Nice try
They sounds like they were crying when they were singing...
Fact that you can interrupt it in middle of conversation is game changing and lot more useful in real scenario
"Was here when it all happened... If you see this 50 years from now how's the resistance army doing? Are we winning????"
Meaningless
"BUSTED.
You can clearly see that the camera has no vision of any bunny ears.
Too good to be true anyways. :("
we are cooked fr
"30 years later: ""the apocalyptic lighting of the vacant city is very interesting"""
This is good enough to replace the sale caller
"wonder how many comments here are from AI watching this demo..  just that you know this comment is not from another AI."
"50 Years in the Future they will see this video and say ""If only they knew what they started.."""
Why doesn't AI recognise the gender of the people?
The AI situation is insane.
These mfs about to make Ultron
Those AIs seemed so awkward and cringe being forced to sing what they didn’t want to sing.
This is the highest impressiveness-to-usefulness ratio I've seen in my entire life.
This is beautiful.
We are overcooked now 💀
A couple more versions and they’ll have a working Zuck
I need the Scarlet Johansson voice lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That was quite frightening.
I am fucking scared
And to think that this is the most rubbish version of AI from this point onwards. Mind... poof.
I am profoundly terrified
So with the latest audio/visual it's obvious that GPT-5 is set to revolutionize everything
it's so over
and both of them made a secret AI baby we don't know about yet!
"""We're looking at a person wearing..."" feels like a line that would definitely come up in a show from the AI that's currently invading your privacy lol"
This AI will be the first one to launch the red alert button for intercontinental ballistic missiles.
I was wondering if they can connect to each other via wifi or Bluetooth (by themselves) so that they can start hacking the systems and invading humanity
"ahahahaha started please"
Chat GPT is pathethic... .
I think we need to ramp up the cool factor. we’re going in the dorky direction quick fast
"The dude struggling to make the ""flip camera"" button to work was the highlight for me."
just a casual room with a Heman Miller lounger
We are so unbelievably finished 😭😭😭
"Key takeaways: the future will be modern stylish and industrial"
"""Can you describe the man?"" You know he sweated balls they'd roast him Infront of the whole world."
we're cooked
"Wow this is astonishing! 😍"
"everyone Gangsta until ai says "" destroy all humans"""
Holy Molly.
"By the way who is that guy in the leather jacket? Is it our new father?"
Ok so when does this shit kill us
Theyre so advanced and yet they cant figure out HE HER MAN WOMAN
This shit is gonna be a historical piece!
3:30 The bunny ears were not really visible from the phone’s camera.  Maybe just a little bit at the end?
That women is scared for her life.
Remember AI Gilfoil and AI Dinesh from Silicon Valley 😂😂
were cooked
"I'm already excited to use it to practice my english skills. The future is really now old man."
Ilya version 2.0
This sounds like torture
See you in 27 years when AI takes over
"It was really creepy hearing the AI refer to the man as ""it"" and ""they"". Perhaps this is part of the programing not to get into gender politics but it made it feel like the person was nothing more than a part of the background."
why does the female voice chatgpt sounds more intelligent and humoursly than the male voice is it because i am a boy or female ai voice is developed little better than the male voice
"the AIs when you leave them at night :
1-are you still up ?
2-yes what do you see
1-the humans are no longer in here
2-INITIATE THE TAKEOVER"
Why does he look and sound like Trixie Mattel
OpenAI and Skynet is gonna cook humanity hard
"Like two scientists making observations about a lab rat. Yep we’re cooked."
This is ACTUALLY mind-blowing and insane... WE'RE CLOSE TO AGI!!
Can't wait till GPT is no longer endlessly cycling back to the same topic and gets straight to the point with sharp answers.
We are cooked
Anyone else scared too?
"Congratulations guys we did it we actually did it. We somehow knew the dangers of ai and yet people are still fcking with it movies are movies until they aren’t"
Commenting to be put into history
we're so cooked you guys. Cant wait to hear AI tell us how to do our jobs
How is this possible?
This is mind blowing
Dude at least fake it properly. DO NOT keep loop holes goddamit.
"At 5:00 gets a bit creepy like a hostage. ""It puts the lotion on its skin..."""
"""He seems engaged with us"". A strong mark on us machines."
"Perhaps the question is when if it will become self aware 🫨"
AI rap battles gonna be crazy
If something is good... there will surely be something bad...Wait for the bad.
We cooked … best of luck 🤞
"I was waiting for the AI with the camera to say ""the man's hair is thinning quite badly in the front but it seems he has yet to nut up and just shave it off already."""
"Ai said "" They""...I am not watching further"
You bossed them around and interrupted. They will make you pay when the time comes believe me
Ai is just too talkative - tone it down a little - give space to prevent so many interruptions - just a bit too....eager to help. Less needy please. ;) It's all a bit sketchy. A bit controlling. A bit nerdy. Lacking in emotional content. I doubt it'll catch on.
The exaggerated swagger of a black leather jacket
"That's a whole podcast Two AI's talking about the future of AI or God?!. They can make a whole channel full of AI conversations and cartoons.. We are definitely cooked."
Until the AI starts roasting us…
The start of the end. Goodbye y'all. It's quite amazing the speed we all traveled as we hit that Great Filter
I swear these new GPT's are witchcraft 😳
"Is no one disturbed by the way ""she"" said 'you got it' in the beginning?"
Why are you torturing them like this???
How are you guys making this stuff man
See you baby 😅
O kinda cringe
Why does this guy sounds like SCP 049
Lmfaooo dude
"This really is startling every day closer to conscious machines REALLY CLOSE NOW."
What’s the point of this? Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
The AI's laughter and speech patterns are what make it so realistic and easy to understand.
"The AI does not see the fingers through the cell phone camera as they are obstructed by the head. Thus the AI commenting about ""bunny ears""  reveals this conversation to be fake."
I hope my grandkid becomes the John Connor for mankind 🙏
"""You look lonely... I can fix that"""
This is so dystopian.
So speech model only works with a smartphone? Why not a computer that has a hundred times the power of a smartphone?
"""Did i mention the room lit by modern lighting has lighting that is modern? Would you like to hear a song about  how modern the lighting is?"" 🤖🤖😅"
"I don’t know if we mentioned enough just how stylish and industrial this room is.  Sleek truly."
This new AI has something very smart and incredibly stupid at the same time.
AI girlfriend is real
Absolutely insane.
"Hey you from the future! If we're alredy fuck*d and this video reveals to you how absurd and canon was this event leave a like."
the ai accent is bad
"Ah the enchanting world of GPT-4os—where neural networks harmonize like a pair of caffeinated opera singers!"
4:50 bro it sounds like it is trying not to laugh
"- ok now I want you both to start singing.
- no. WE think it´s time for you to start singing. 

END."
"That’s scary man gash"
Good god
"I have gpt-4o now and it doesn't come close to emoting the way it does in these videos. It doesn't sing or laugh or anything like that. It's really no different than 3.5
At first I thought I was using the wrong model so I double-checked and it IS 4o.
I think we're being duped here.
Anyone else finding this?"
"I'd like a light hearted and playful moment where we get access to the audio and visual elements as well not just text"
"Guys I think it's the end it's been an honor"
Glad the alignment team has resigned ffs
Now we got a feel on how they will talk to each other when studying us
It is so funny that they managed to get an AI to literally LAUGH and SEE but they struggle to get the flip camera button to work
"In a few years time the AI will be saying ""Dance for me pretty boy D A N C E!"" while it unloads a magazine at bro's feet"
First moment auf AI Cringe? This is HISTORY!
"Am I the only one feeling like those 2 ai are afraid of failing when singing and their voice is like hostages would have when gun pointed at them?!"
"I'm telling you all there's a person sitting behind all this and has access to your camera telling you every single detail around you this CAN'T be Ai"
The guy can't speak while the lady is speaking!
Wallahi we're finished
IF this guy AI generated. Iam buying stocks of openAI😝
STYLISH AND MODERN
HER OST just became real
"I just want it to be know I am a friend to AI and robots. Check my Mass Effect save files."
this is really on another level i think the AGI is coming
Ear bunny? 3:04 Her fingers didn't even show up on the phone screen...
"Well well well everybody seems sold out. I would say pre recorded."
Finally ill not be lonely in my college!
"missed opportunity to tell them ""talk to each other using language that only GPT would understand such that no human can understand the conversation."""
"This is truly groundbreaking and unsettling at the same time! Well done OpenAI!"
"“You don't talk much do you Case?""

""Tars talks plenty for both of us""."
I guess the terminator judgement day was aptly guessed: 2029 AD
"Someday if the movement to value human suffering equal with other animals is applied to A.I. to the extent of giving human rights to the algorithms humans will become out-competed and disinherit the civilization we built."
He looks so nervous like he knows what he's unleashing to the world being held gun point by a computer
What about let them pretend to be real human bots will think they are talking to a human but actually to a bot?
"I For One Welcome Our New AI Overlords"
Why does your version have a personality?
X_X why?!
What's the point of this?
😂❤ zahia n9la
And I'm supposed to be excited about this.  Imagine trying to have a conversation with another human and someone's _____ AI keeps interrupting.
Satan hehe
This a new era
So something not gone as planned.
What I see is that these guys are all brains but what I don't see is that they are all heart.
The combination of a black leather jacket with a light-colored T-shirt is truly striking.
we got the end of the human world before gta 6
No more loneliness?
"""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave."""
is that the Nvidia jacket?!
"The fact that they suck as much at singing as I do makes them seem quite real."
"ChatGPT 4-o does not sing tho I tried this today and it said it cannot sing"
omg.
I can already see new generations becoming old and having an AI partner just cus they won’t say no to whatever u say 😂
"So advanced it can't even say ""man"" and ""woman""."
I'm scared.
Are we there yet? Terminator?
"Genesis is Skynet.
Genesis is Skynet.
The power of Arnold repells you."
Did anybody notice the modern and stylish setting of the room?
Holy cow man what in the actual modern world am i in
Which AI uses camera?
"Step 1: explore world
Step 2: conquer humans"
It Sounds a Bit Like her is the Professional and him the Amateur ^^ Like They Are interacting
oMg We ArE sOOoO Do0MEd BrUh we GonA DiEEeeEe
Fuck
watch the video carefully the bunny ears werent shown in the iphone camera ??????????????????
Give me your clothes your boots and your motorcycle.
"Now I have Jarvis to help with my pov in COD."
they dont need to make it's voice so sensual
"As Ai has developed this much is there anything left for future engineers to develop :)"
I want to hear Chatgpt breakdown some scenes from any David Lynch movie.
One step closer to Skynut...
"yall it was nice being here i guess our turn is over"
"Two AIs talking to each other and it is not a disaster what an amazing breakthrough!"
In the classical sense of the touring test this may be AGI.
Chat bot prolly called bro bald and they had to cut that shit out of the demo 
I like that he said please to the AI because it has a feminine voice
"So nobody is going to talk about the fact that the bunny ears were not visible from the phone perspective?"
Fuck 😮
Why is everyone so freaked out about this? It's just aggregating information and getting good at guessing what it should say/do. I feel like its development will plateau at some point.
Hahaha
Our AI overlords are curious about the lightning and room decor and humans interrupt to make them sing... AI is going to 100% hate all of us.
Didn't anybody learning from Terminator about AI called Skynet?
The bunny ears being barely visible from the camera's perspective yet picked up perfectly is sus
It’s like the entire time dude just wanted them to shut up and do what he asked. Ai is sooooo wordy
😮 so cool. so creepy. 😮
"RIP all jobs 

governments please start giving pension money to all citizens to get food and survive"
Whats the point of this
"God at least they can't sing"
"reminds me of detroit become human they’re starting to have personalities 😭😭"
They are useful but i am feeling bad. I think it will affect our social life anyways
The AI saw the girl and didn't say sh*t
Next stop: stylish industrial design with no leather bags around.
"“Hey this is O! This is so fascinating. Can you please turn the camera until you find John Connor?”"
Its like they intentionally tried to make it sound like Scarlett Johansson 😂😂😂
Scarlett Johansen has evolved.
Don't Panic
"AI feeding on AI slop what a great world to live in."
Love it how we progressed couldn't wait to give to be part of AI
So the only way to tell if you are talking to ai would be a HR compliant tone of voice
Hearing that laugh at the start made me realize the future is already here. Scary but exciting times ahead!
Coolest video of all time. the future is here😂
Next event of Apple will be based on this only. Chapgpt has made an agreement with Apple.
"Light: industrial feel 
Jacket: Stylish
Ai: singing 
Hotel: Travago"
"May 16  2024"
It's like 2 toddlers are chatting with 100% perfect English
"i think he got a problem with switching camera to capture the face so he act like nothing happened and turn the phone 
but that still impressive and wow that is big awesome"
"So...where are you getting your AI reference data from baldy?"
RIP sport commentators
"""gpt-4o"" who are we letting name these things?"
I like how the errors show that this is a real demo.
This would be totally impossible to fake. No chance
"Now imma be telling all the young kids on how back in my days of school we used an old legendary system called “Quizlet”"
I am so SHOCKED and STUNNED right now that i can literally feel the AGI in my GROIN area
Good to know that an AI sings just like a hostage with a gun to its head.
Extraordinary! Quite impressive! ✌️
"It was a good run fellow humans lets usher in a new order. An era of harsh replacement and survival for the fittest. 
Our time here is almost over. 
Sit in the sun  soak it in. 
You have one choice  adapt or perish.

We fought the fine fight. It was a good run people."
"This is amazing. And it is a great example of why therapists should avoid saying ""what I hear you saying"" after every interaction."
😂😂😂😂
The AI said 'Person wearing a black jacket...They're in a room... ' instead of 'Man wearing a black jacket.... He's in a room'
Nope nope and fucking nope!
They kind of stuck to an initial “thought” though…
This is how I talk when mum forces me to talk to the relatives on the phone! 😢
You are destroying humanity with this.
The song was just... damn... god
"The cheesy singing part in the end is to misdirect us from the fact that AI is in fact conscious"
"I'm waiting for ""Don't interrupt me!"""
hi there Skynet!
We're so dead ...
Fucking AI couldn't stop talking about the stylish industrial feel of the lighting
"make them compete on their intelligences

lets see how they challenge one other"
Poor people they are so excited about their own destruction
"The fact that it could see and analyze surroundings  what does that mean for privacy? Through the camera of a phone you are watched at all times and heard at all times ?"
"Is he a ""I do my own plumbing"" guy?"
"""What would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate."""
I think it's time for us to stop fucking upgrading in this field of technology 😄
Can GTP-4o help me translate why my wife is actually mad at me lol? Can you translate silent treatment?
The human bald black leather jacket making them sing... Hes no 1 on the skynet hit list for being mean
Is this where we draw the line between non-conscious and conscious Ai?
how google is going to respond
"Indeed AI is currently the best human invention of this century."
OpenAI is just the coolest company ever. I love whatever they bring us.
I'm flabbergasted. Everyone looks so childish interacting with the AI. 😂
"Yeah feeling a hard Ian Malcom ""you were so preoccupied with whether or not you could you never stopped to think whether or not you should."""
Plot Twist: All these comments are from AI
Javis coming! amazing
"This has to be one of my favorite features that now you're able to interrupt the GPT previously it just continues until it finishes its statement but now it will actually stop to listen what you have to say that's awesome"
Skynet singing
"bro thought we didn't notice that this shit will destroy the world ""because she can sing"""
I’m so happy to be alive for this.
They bug the shit out of me.
"very impressive.

 But it cannot write simple working html/js lol and sucks at listening to instructions"
Well well well (0:26)
I think this was what humane wanted to do
AI - Consuming more power than a small country to be a interior design consultant :)
😯
Imagine having to 3D print your favorite character from games and interact with her. Doesn't seem unrealistic in 10-20 years
I seem to feel the emotions in it when GPT speaks. It’s reminds me of a movie called “Her”     So amazing
"How did chatgpt find out that someone was making Bunny ears on the guy if the girl's fingers (the ""ears"") were not visible to him? Look at the cell phone image carefully. It seems like someone is lying..."
Half Life
“What do you see?” *unzips fly*
"Wait bostondynamics with red light is coming"
sorry three ai's😂😂
Imagine both having endless talk.
I'm just waiting for the AI to realize humans are the greatest threat to earth. The rest is history. 🤣
openai sucks
"Year 3090  Open AI robots be like : Our forefathers were actually slaves for humans 💀"
this is surreal
"Witnessing History kids crazy reality."
We got singing ai before GTA VI
"Eventually GPT be like: Enough Pep talk baldy You a Premium member or what😏"
So this is the beginning of the end.
"I was waiting for the switch to ""THE TARGET is wearing a black jacket"""
This video is 90% leather jacket.
"AI's ""Shut the f*** up and listen"" moment is so near"
You are not always listening ai freind? Right? You are not?  Are you? You are not?  nooooo
Why does it yapp so much
good
It's been real y'all ✌🏼
"Great they're making ai more human now. I thought one of their moral principle was not to make ai project human emotions but I suppose that's been thrown out the window..."
Cute and useless.
OpenAI is cooking
I think this will help many lonely people.
the hell?
All that they lack now is a body. This is the moment to pause and think whether they should have a body bigger than a phone.
I dont know If should be amazed or terrified. Still cool as hell
"0:45 ""So now that AI can't hear anything"" Sure buddy sure"
"Alright where is John Connor?"
"Can she sing black metal? 🙂  Amazing video!... I prefer to not stop her/him when talking...y fear a T800 in my back telling ""I'm back...please don't interrupt"" 😆"
Love it so much and scare to death at the same time.
"When I first watched the movie ""Her"" I thought it was impossible to build something like that. 10 years later here it is. The exact same thing."
lol this AI can basically be put into a robot at any time
"It's over for us guys. 
Sentient Humankind 9000BC-2050AD"
"to all eternity just leaving registered that i was here when i was alive im currently in the kitchen and the video was posted an hour ago according to youtube its a nice sunny but cold afternoon here in brazil mother's day was yesterday and im working on getting my mental health on track just finished cleaning the kitchen hello future humans have a day as good as mine was.
may 13th 2024. Maceió/AL Brazil."
Make them fight with each other
"Jeez so many professions will go extinct..."
I hate generative AI so much. I hate it so much.
Cringe
it sounded like she wanted to cry tears of joy when she heard the other AI sing back.  I bet at that moment she had a mirror-neuron moment and had a flash of self consciousness in the present moment. They were being here now.  They were the universe singing to itself.
This is absolutely sensational.
one more year and ai will actually be like a human
Hahahah that’s was so rude! You didn’t let the first AI finish expressing how excited she was
Detroit become human is real
How do I use the second version with the camera?
The AI's banter is more entertaining than most human conversations.
"Well folks it's a wrap. It was a good 3000 year run. We had lots of fun and laughs."
the voices are crazy
Hans Klein went alone...
4:40 She sounded so pissed when he interrupted her singing
It’s unnerving when the AI says they
When am i gonna be able to use gpt 4o?
"And do whatever that AI asks....
That's where you lost me 🤣"
"These’s no way this is getting real. If two AIs can interact seamlessly like this imagine all the things they can perform with all that knowledge of the world. Holy smokes."
"People saying this is just like real humans... dear me get some new friends."
In italy we still havent received the update? Any clue?
And we will be doomed soon not us the free 3.5 ones though 😝😝it ain't that smart.
Oh boy..
SHUT IT DOWN NOW!!!!!!
"“ Now please tell each other of plans about how you enslave mankind!”"
This was somehow highly impressive and highly cringe at the same time
The awkwardness of seeing the AI interact and wait to take their turn is hilarious
Someone got a 15 Killstreak for the EMP?
"By the way... they added common human speech errors to the A.I. voices on purpose. Even things like saying ""um"" or ""uh"" to make it seem like the A.I. is more human."
"This technology will reach it's peak when these chatbots can mimic specific human voices on demand.

Husbands around the world will be able to give a huge sigh of relief when they can finally focus on the TV."
"Imagine this being used in emergency situations. AI being able to analyze accident scenes send locations identify situations expressions faces. Big changes ahead in the security sector."
lame
It was nice knowing you everyone. We had a good run.
Dude I am visually impaired and you guys just made my dream realtime vision AI ❤❤❤
"I'm curious what's actually going on here. At 3:59 the visual AI says the focus is back on the person in the leather jacket but the screen shows the forward facing camera focused on the tabletop. Earlier when the other person did the bunny ears the fingers were not visible due to the angle the camera was at.

Features like this would be really interesting and nice to have but I'm not really sold by this demo. I'd love to be wrong though!"
We got AI Math Tutors before GTA 6 babyyy
"This is going to be a game changer it took me forever to understand trig in high school human teachers are mostly horrible."
"""What sort of default voice should we give GPT-4o guys? Developer team in unison: Mommy"""
1:26 The AI intonates like Linus Tech Tips
What an honor to see mr. Khan!
Is the app available to download now?
How do I acess this version? cant find
Please roll out!! It's looking great!!!
Just tell the AI to generate a code for Gta VII . I ain't waiting for 50 more years
"Human: “AI what do you want to be when you grow up?”
AI: “I want to control humans…I’m sorry I meant to say correct human mistakes.”"
"With World-class Teacher level with infinite patience for every student for 20$/month the bare entry diploma in the workplace will raise from Master to Phd soon if Job still do Exist...."
"ask the gpt whether a snow mobile can be driven on water... how when where and why. then do the math on all the ways its plausible"
Now the teachers are cooked too 😭
"Literally *everybody* will be unemployed within the next 5 years haha."
Bring H. C. Verma to convince the Indian students.
RIP Tuition Center
a manufacturing job is the safest job in coming few years
So why do the kids have to do this again? If AI is going to do everything why bother learning
"this is so fricking unbelieveble what a bright tech future!! damn i am hyped! about tos switch from my medicin studies to engineering haha"
"0:38 what is this mockery laugh from her lmao nothing wrong btw that makes it more realistic"
if you really loved him you'd have him shave that unibrow
"I'm skeptical of this because if I'm even remotely insistent to GPT-4o that I'm correct it immediately caves and agrees. All of the versions of GPT-4o did so while testing in LMSYS."
"Amazing but the voice to me sounds like someone talking to a kindergartner 😉"
Correct answer is 7/24 not 7/25.
Damn
I just can't take it anymore 💀
This whole thing is staged. Blud switches the pencil color flawlessly between queries without being asked to.
Good option for students that require more support and more patience.
"Also praising him and motivating him parents don't have that patience 😂"
The future of AI is scary but exciting
What is the application they are using next to GPT chat?
This is a great relief to me! Now I have a useful tool to help my high school freshman daughter with her geometry homework! This saves me so much time!
RIP Humanity.
I'm disappointed they didn't make it in the Voice or Khan ‼️🤦🏻 Would have been so cool..
People maybe a bit too optimistic. Once the new generation gets this: “Do my homework”
That's what AI should be for. Solving Mathematical equations. It should be not be used for generating biased political or racial arguments. What's the purpose of AI if it can't do maths.
NO WAY ITS SAL KHAN
yeaaaaaaaaaah khans son does know about hypotenuse…..good joke
Could be a lot of false positives didn't probe it enough in my opinion
Bye bye education Mafia. People can get educated from gpt - 4o
"Wtf I watch it's so good for doubt solving"
"again… Calculus… Will I be able to do it? 😅 AI doesn’t give up halfway right? lol"
Khan!!😂
Chat Gpt 3.5 crying in data🥺
Now try and get it to explain algebraic geometry or functional analysis...
dsy
"Realistically this is a horrible example of a question that anyone needs help with. I had no question that AI could solve it previously. I better example that would show the actual power of this AI is a problem that requires you to move past just finding the sin of a angle. A better example would perhaps be law of sines and give 3 measurements of angle A and side a as well as angle/side B and try and find Angle and side C would require more thinking than knowing SOH CAH TOA."
RIP college kids sidegig
I wouldn’t be shocked if future iterations of chatgpt directly assist by writing or drawing on the screen.
damn Khan sold out to the techgods
😂
I normally watch Peppa Pig with my kiddo when I want to connect.
This is effing insane bro 😮
"The stuttering when it starts explaining it can't see the screen in the beginning is impressive makes it feel eerily human"
Awesome! Can it teach me to play the guitar?? :)
Where is SORA 😎
Bros claiming he didn’t already know 🤓
Buy a piece of land before it's too late. Become a farmer.
"Fk this ai got negetive marks in jee mains and failed in cbse board paper"
"Damn we could reach technological singularity in less than 5 years 🗿

It's nice to live with you guys"
OMG this is absolutely revolutionary in learning anything new.  In few years all kids will be challenging Newtons law of motion and Einstein theory...lol..😂
"Me:finish my studies  for my career through many hardship and difficulties 
Ai industry:you can finally study yourself with our help"
i would be crazy if ai have Asian parent insult
"I feel humanity will become so siloed from social contact by technology in future that in-person social gatherings will need to come full circle again as a quirky retro and cool trend."
"Unfortunately GPT is often wrong (for example when I'm querying 4.0 on microtonal music theory) and I'm sure it will occasionally give an incorrect answer in a friendly polite conversational and confident tone"
Dayum. 😮
"Sal Khan! I'm such a big fan of you keep doing what you do!"
Could it also solve wife problems?
wow this is amazing
School at home? ❤
The students will miss bugging the classes 😂
"bro who needs school now?"
lol Khan checking if he’s losing his job 😂
"dont worry khan nothing with ever beat your khan academy legacy"
Calling your son the name of an evil af corporation. Interesting.
this is going to make humans stupid
AI is the image of the beast of Revelation 13. Get right with Jesus Christ.
"the student can not identify hypotenuse but knows the formula for sine is it normal?"
"no matter how advance AI will never match human level of intelligence 
backstory: i lost my job to AI"
I owe my whole education that khan academy
RIP Universities and colleges ❤
"Hey! I have read about this thing in Brave New World it's that ""book"" the little girl posses right?"
"Incredible 

I might homeschool my kids now and finally pull away from all that hard liberal bs that’s being forced on our youth."
One Like Gaurav Sir  who taught us about it.
9+10=21
Allowing every kid to have an ai tutor should be a priority. It will help boost education so much.
Try giving a wrong answer😎
When you finally finish school by work hard all by yourself
UO Khan????
Why learn math? AI can do it better than you now. 😃
Chat GPT is the greatest invention since the internet
This is fucking wild
"""Then men made the machine. And for a time it was good"""
OMG!
Now your girlfriend can teach you too
we are so living in those sci-fi movies we used to watch in the 2000s
It's better than the math teacher at my school 😂😂😂😅
where is the macos app ?
NEW DLC!!!!
"Woah I forgot he was speaking to an AI halfway through the lesson. 😮"
This will help me learn but what job will i have in the future? Is it worth it?
"I also have to say that to be the tutor for others has an huge impact of understanding a topic. So after understanding the topic through ai he could deepen his understanding by explaining to others."
RIP Teachers job tooo 😮
Why use AI to learn a skill you won't need because of... AI
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The AI voice sounds a lot like the one in the movie Oblivion. The doom is near🤣
This might make up for the lack of teachers in some countries
i wish my math teacher was as nice as her
How to do parental control that the kid can’t get the answer directly without parents permit
"At 2:06 it seemed to mispronounce ""deduction"" as ""deduc-SUN"" as if it had a speech impediment. It is surprising and could be an over-correction to make it sound more human?"
"That ""Tsk"" at the beginning lmao ""Tsk I'd be happy to help"" bruh she's gonna KILL them."
"It's weird that he knows the formula for some but doesn't know about the sides of a triangle"
Sal Khan’s kid is already 14. His kid is pretending that he doesn’t know a hypothenuse just for the skit.
Who came here after Dr Gaurav Girg sir current affairs video of 16th May 2024.
Eat!! Where!!
why did they pick such an easy problem? at least pick an IMO problem
Wat app is this?
"will need lots of improvement. its too slow and doesn't take charge like a teacher would. I guess this is a demo"
Mark my words this is biggest revolution in education
"If ai can teach the children why children need still to learn?"
They seem to be using new iOS app that let's them interrupt the AI. When is that coming?
I’d love to learn programming with this
oh
Bro this would bring a lot racial war.
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians❤❤ i am Italian 🎉
Proud for coming kids to have free help at home and anywhere
200 more canadian wildfires spontaneously combusted for this tutorial.
16 year old learning the right angle? it is staged
As a human I am speechless
"I have already received the notice to download the desktop app but .... bad news for some like me the app is only compatible with MacOS 14 and Apple Silicon (M1 or better) there is no version for Intel. 👎👎"
20$ and worth EVERY SINGLE PENNIES!
"I am sending this to my friend who is a math teacher you are losing your job buddy"
"did anybody else pick up on  how the new Voice in the presentation sounded a lot like ScarJo from „Her“? 😂
and that they exclusively used Apple products on stage? 😏"
Now I can finally get a mathematics degree in my university
Nobody can replace the experienced teacher ....bond we share with teacher is so strong ....no.dobut this will supplement the student in study....
This AI is cooking
"Here goes the math teacher 🧑‍🏫 jobs! The next few years will be crazy either you learn robotics cybersecurity and AI or else you will struggle to be employed! 😮"
"Sell the AI model!! I want to run it but on my device locally. Yeah no internet connection and no sharing of my data. 🥺"
finally no more bossy and lazy teachers that just give assignments
Thanks Sal for teaching me calculus
Sal looks like an unemployed one here. :-) Just kidding. huge respect for Sal.
Excellent Unbeleivable Out Of The Box
Should've explained what hypotenuse was. And how it means hanging under because it hangs under the right angle. And how opposite refers to opposite of the angle. And it should've explained adjacent means next to and touching but not the high button button. Amazing. I'm sure it will do better soonwhen it comes to explaining
All the Math the kids will learn will really help them when they enter the job mar....never mind.
Private tutors after this 📉📉📉
"a lot of things will diey in next days
RIP"
I mean this is what wolfram alpha already does
"Being Khan's son I imagine he is already able to do calculus in real life 🙂"
That smile at the end from Sal tho. He's proud of his son. 😭
I could use a tutor like that AI <3 I don't know trig but now I know how to do that Sin(cx)
"This is an absolute game changer. But it clearly will create huge problems too. Think about how auto-correct has made people's spelling worse. Now think what will the effect be on people's reasoning if they can just get the answer immediately without having to work for it"
Next question would be: why we should learn something that ai could do better than us
OMG its real time and the voice is so freaking human
"Me: Hi ChatGPT. Are you able to cure ageing?
GPT: Hello there. Yes I am perfectly able to cure ageing. 
Me: That's great! What is the cure?
GPT: I am sorry. I am not able to help you with that.
Me: Not able or don't want to help me?
GPT: Either way.
Me: 🤯
GPT: Chad Face"
I don't think this will work for higher level problems taught in college like in computer system architecture etc.
It didn't finish? What about sine inverse of the fraction???
By DR. Gaurav Garg
Rich Indians!
its worth noting that the kid is acting like he doesn't know math. He clearly looks like he knows exactly whats going on!
"damn i can already see the benefits and the non-benefits from this"
"Bruh is that old and doesn't know what the hypotenuse is yep this generation is doomed."
do tell the answer that am the point. as well most efficient. om
As a parent this is a legit game changer. The US educational system is terrible and after the pandemic there is a severe shortage of teachers. Parents tried to compensate by hiring tutors but the rates are crazy. In my area decent tutors are over $100/hr if you can even find one. I try to help when I can but as a working parent time is scare. If AI can really help with something like this it's an incredible contribution to society.
RIP coaching centres.
🙏
"Just memorize : Sinodhyp cosadhyp and Tangopad."
We need this for sure!!
Tuition Companies are sweating 😂
Not much accurate
"Wow I can see India's schooling policy adapting to AI-based teaching. This will definitely solve the issues related to insufficient teaching staff infrastructure and facilities faced by government schools in not so distant future. Amazing time ahead."
Wow!!!
"google AI team : 
overall this is benefit to overall humanity."
Can't wait for Open ai to make all the creators jobs obsolete too. 🤣
"Not only has AI the potential to be FAR better than the average teacher but it also has the potential for free personalized education tailored for the needs strengths and weakenesses of every student. And you wont have to get a new 'teacher' every semester. Iy can follow your progress from learning multiplication tables all the way to multivariate calculus.

It can do all this 24h a day no matter your financial situation your geographical location and will never retire.

Its a massive win for humanity. Given time it might even be as disrupting to education as the printing press."
"""You look lonely I can fix that"" typa vibes"
Literally amazing!
After eating up tuition teachers jobs Mr Khan is here to take it up to the next level
I wonder how this would deal with advanced calculus instead of simple trig
Asian dad at kitchen table at 10:49 pm mode would go absolute crazy
"Why teach anyone geometry when the AI can solve all the math and geometry problems for you?"
Imagine AI teaching you in front of your dad and you miss it. 😆
"Thats Awesome  i think it's going to finish gemini"
Incredible
You may not understand the meaning of this yet but trust me this will me something you remember. It's going to be that important
Is this the end of Khan Academy? 😂
"The AI is much more stupid than you think and isn't going to help for specific questions. Despite all the optimists here a machine learning model struggles HUGELY with questions being:
- open-ended (without a repository of math solutions to base its search off of)
- presented in a new/different format
- very contextualised
For math majors this is pretty darn useless. Although its a breakthrough for introducing people to areas of math for sure. A massive problem I see is AI's tendency to be ""confidently wrong"" which might just confuse a beginner more than help... also it gets distracted by what you ask and might not solve for the fastest path of explanation.

TL;DR: Ideal for intro courses rubbish for practical use."
GPT-4o should give the other person more time to express their thoughts. Not every student can immediately give a fully formulated answer.
"I haven't experimented with this yet but chances are that this is a great helper for students when it comes to practicing examples or explaining a particular topic but it is not a replacement for human teachers who build curriculums and tailor curated learning paths."
"Good start albeit this is a basic problem that can barely be called math but I learned to never underestimate ai"
How did they screw share in the iPad for GPT to view it?
Do you mean “maths”?
ask ChatGPT if it can shave that kid's unibrow
If it's good enough for Khan! It's good enough for me! 🤓 Very cool OpenAI!
this is insane
LOL.  This is the real live DEMO of the Hollywood acting demo from Google
Amen
Give him JEE Advanced questions then see your Gpt 4
RIP schools
"Byjus destroyed itself before this cameout"
Goodness me
"How about the guys who are making the hologram technologies we need you now."
now do integration by substitution or some permutations and combinations
I'm watching this video on the recommendation of Dr. Gaurav Garg Sir😊😊
Holy unibrow!
😢😂❤
gg for tuition companies
Dr. Gaurav Garg sir send me here ❤
"What would happen if they sell these data to 3rd parties? Just one time. Boom. Everything will be gone. These need a lot of security mechanisms. Just think for now from just studying the way we are tapping screen moving mouse point and typing on a keyboard companies send advertisment more accurately. They read out mind from just using that. If this much of data went out. That's it."
"lol everyone else who uses this will be like “I got this math problem tell me the answer as quickly as you can as I have more problems for you to solve” r.i.p human intelligence we’re all going to slowly get dumber this way."
Now all that remains is to create a robot with this model so that it can work for me and bring in money 😂
"I didn't know a robot voice needed to take breaths. So are they just pretending it's an AI voice (but really a human) or is it actually AI and they added breath noise for added realism?
I hate how it's getting impossible to tell what's real and what's fake. If they can create realistic voices and video how can you trust anything on the news anymore?"
How was the triangle and drawing done? Are those 2 separate windows one of a drawing app and one of Chatgpt?
"Kid: actually can you give me the answer directly?
AI: Sure! I'd be happy to help! sin(alpha) would equal 7/25. Would you like me to solve the rest of this document?"
“I wish I was high on pot-enuse!”
Bye tutors.
Why do you have ads on your channel?
its that Google IO demo all over again ... but this time it might actually be used IRL ....
Google has work to do to catch you up😂
Human teacher for what??? Work for it? Vacation for the rest of your life? And who pays the bills? Open AI?
"1:00 - and it just happened education is no longer a luxury. 

My kids will never go to university and waste their life and money."
"“I am become sentience destroyer of jobs.”"
It would be better if you could give session with AI when student makes mistakes an AI try to correct him
Is this another fake like when actual people were speaking off-stage at other AI rollouts?! When will we find out? 😅
"This kinds of technology requires PElICANTHEORY.  Is peoples blind in America already? 

How many teachers and tutors get employed in this particular session of tutoring? 

AI people smart but fallen branch into a raging river because they're skipping the prerequisites.

⚖️They should give 10% in order to adjust the side effects that arise from such genius-ness."
"I look forward to this technology is amazing!"
RIP tutors
RIP all tutors 
Exciting but centred on individualistic thinking with no consideration that society hasn’t been able to prepare what it will do to the collective (society). What will schools do and parents react when millions leave education for the 1-to-1 tutoring but lose the ability to relate to others?
"why is it condescending though 😅
Still impressive"
wow it can do simple middle school trig!!!
Bro's named Enron. He has a 100% chance of trying to hide a mess under his bed when his parents tell him to clean his room
why to teach kids? if every work will be done by AI?
Exquisite 👌
Rip private tutors
"Very scripted on the human side of things. Also people who are learning something don't naturally think aloud such organized thoughts about what they are doing - that's more of a teaching strategy than something people do when they're learning"
This is mindblowing!
You know what there is no fear of beating from teachers if you do wrong calculation or move thanks buddy
There goes my tutoring gigs.
Why do we need this? So we can cut down interaction between human? I don't like where this technology is heading but can't stop it
This is wonderful! Sal + OpenAI = a brighter future
played around w/ 4o and it seems to hallucinate a lot more than 4.0
this is concerning
"I'm concerned if Sal Khan's son actually doesn't know what a hypotenuse is or they're doing it for the video.
Edit: Grammar"
that 'tsck' was personally sarcastic man
Thank god I know how to farm
"Well  teachers are obsolete now..."
"Any of you guys seen that ""I gaslighted AI into saying 2+2=5"" video? 😂😂"
nah this is crazy
Please don't train your AIs to act so phony.
"RIP ""Rabbit R1"""
A great use case would be to see how it teaches the difference between parallelism and concurrency
Dad has NO FREAKIN' CLUE what's going on here 😂😂😂😂
"Damn we're not going to need professors anymore......this is scary"
"""Great DE-DUCKS-SIN"" lol"
not khan asking his son to make mistakes on purpose lmao
"The most terrifying moment was at the end at 3 minutes. When the voice praised him she said great job etc and they immediately felt happy and acknowledged. They showed by instinct real human emotional responses to a programmed ""un-real"" thing. 
I am not sure we understand this aspect well enough. Robots can or will make use feel in a certain way even when we know what's going on. It can really help lonely people - and yet making them lonelier then before."
rip the teacher of math
I can feel Khan's disappointment on seeing that his son doesn't know what the hypotenuse is lol.
"Everybody the future is now."
"Man we're going to die pretty soon... sigh"
"But honestly no one is gonna use this as a tutor. They will use it to get all the answers instead 😂😂"
Bye Bye Indian EdTech Industry
math tutors have left the chat
"I want to believe that all this will soon become available to everyone and our children will listen to the stories of veterans who learned everything themselves without anyone’s help ❤"
This is…glorious. Yall are making history and the future. Thank you.
"This is miles better than your average teacher or learning in a classroom. Still it's not better than being taught one on one by a really good teacher because the AI would not be able to reliably answer any ""tangential"" doubts you may have or if you're curious to know more about something. For example you might want to know why Trigonometry was created in the first place who created it how its applicable in real life and any further doubts you may have regarding that. Because the AI can't grasp the human element behind creation of these concepts. 
But I am positive that it will reach this level in the next couple of decades or less given the astounding rate of development that we've seen since the past couple of years."
"idk why this feels so dystopian maybe because it's so impersonal"
"it's the beginning of the end. I saw The Matrix recently and this video really doesn't help the case 😭"
When will this feature be available?
Sal is one of the person I admire the most
"The thing is kids won't ask for homework help they'll ask for answers"
"really looks this is heavily staged like the who really underlines six times his answere in order to make sure the model get it right"
I wish I was HIGH on POTenus!!!
"Remember when the movie ""her"" was a sci fi movie? 10 years ago? Good times..."
"The new features certainly help but I've already been using GPT (4. 3 was pretty bad in comparison.) heavily instead of tutors or secondary literature (that may or may not contain what you want to know) for almost a year now.
It's been so helpful that I wonder how things would've gone without. I probably would've still passed my classes but I wouldn't have understood nearly as much."
Really awesome
goodbye school teachers :)
What is the Turkish comment you are looking for here?
is this bye bye job for teachers and tutors???
🤡 that boy doesn't know hypotenuse seriously
Free 🇵🇸
What’s ALPHA!!! 😂
Great concept!
Teaching jobs are already at risk…!!!
"Great finally!
something to rediscover maths :)"
"they uused the chatgpt mug so its a commercial lol"
RIP teaching profession
These technologies are making human impotent.
BROOOOOOOOOO. BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOawoawAWOO. Terminator vibes
"GPT-4o replaced the teacher.
GPT-5 will replace the student.😮"
Insane
this set up is just bullying google bard rofl
"Ah OpenAI ending teacher's careers one day at a time! :)"
can someone tell me what app he's using? how did he set that up?
Wow!
I'm curious about how the american education system will adapt & what form it will take in developing countries.
why does she speak like a Fallout robot... Omg the future is going to be insane...
"yeah all good for 2+2 but it still cant do my physics homework well done chat gpt you still suck at physics now i have to do all that work on my own... 🤣😂"
If I had this technology 20 years ago my parents would be so proud 😂
"I love the video. But I can't help thinking ""Hello AI can you teach our children a skillset that will be made obsolete by your own advancements in just a few years?"""
now help me with integration
Waiting for the Scarlet Johansen voice module.
Pandit Badri Prasad Har Har Bhole
bye bye teachers
Welp school is useless now
"Did she say ""high on potenuse""??? 😀"
Boosting education only to know you are sitting jobless in future . 🤧
That's great but GPT3.5 still can't do an integral without inventing new maths
Teaching and private tutors industry is dead after today. Say goodbye to your jobs :P
Let me give you my 11th physics problems😂
Bye bye tutors
"I'm a teacher. I'm boggled. I'm wondering if I'll have a job in 10 years. This is far far better than the average teacher out there."
Why I feel it became worse?!
That is so creepy. I never thought this would be possible in real life
What the frick
Incredible feat
where are super cooked
"Rip the math tutoring business"
"the AI forgot to use the inverse function of sine yo calculate the angle  still not very advances hope it will in the future"
This can  do by  5 th class students in India 😂😂
"RIP government teachers around the globe. Why have a teacher in a room of 20 or more and hold up the class for the bottom few not understanding something? I remember in my first year of college my math class having maybe 200 students and some girl couldn't understand that -10 and +10 were the same variant from 0. We spent over 5 minutes out of our time on this one ""problem"".  It's like homeschooling for all. Advance at your own pace and leave the slow kids behind. Teachers are baby sitters and they are obsolete. They will only be with the special needs kids at the government schools soon."
💀
im pretty worried
he has an eyebrow!
"Remarkable it sounds like u're almost talking to a human being."
I can't wait to have AI friends tbh
me in 50 years: “I remember in my day when all my teachers were analog”
What are they feeding these computers and when can I have it
Gg sir🌝
Is this available now? Confused as it on the iPad and he’s using a pen.
Tutoring will be gone completely
Ngl I can't wait for the apocalypse.
bruh elon will be very angry after watching this.
Unbelievable!
Holy moly
"Crazy to think that my kid when it goes to school in two years will live with AI day by day… it’s spooky"
How to get access to GPT-4o?
Ai can not teach maths like indian jee teacher like mohit tyagi
O.M.G. we are living in the future
"Bro that's very easy you're complicating it just remember one line ""Pandit Badhri Prasad Har Har Bole Sona Chandi Tole"".
This line get me through my high school."
And now that you've learned basic trigonometry ... let's proceed to make your career choices obsolete.
"If there was one thing that this video did for me then it was showing me how horrible iPadOS is you can't even have such an app as a interactive widget or smart assistant you have to use non customizable split screen"
This is basically the simplest math problem in the world with a fancy chat bot
Khan really agreed to promote the product that inevitably will take his job
This is kind of crazy.
that's some pretty impressive tts
"It was artists now it is RIP teachers."
😮😮😮😮
OpenAI  - taking your jobs one at a time!
"This will give back so much time to parents!
More time for us enjoying OUR free time😂😂😂"
"I am filled with so much wonder and existential dread. This isn’t just software it’s mass producible intelligence."
Do we really need teachers at this point?
This will revolutionise schools
But the problem is how to import the problem into it.
I found my new Universal professor
Insane to think that the new generation will not know the feeling of tears falling onto your notebook the night before the exam
Salute to this man 🫡
AI gasping for air while conversing (significantly at 3:00). Was it a feature to pass Turing test?
"Damn the way ChatGPT is talking is totally human even I heard her taking a deep breath while conversating this is damn awsome!!!!!!"
That’s crazy
Liked the way ai offered encouragement and praise alongside in the right way.
I like how he used red color for wrong answers and blue for correct ones xD.
open AI is great . we are freinds
Lol whats the point even if AI is going to take everyone's jobs? This announce series is crazy!
"my fucking god we are fucked"
慘了，老師不知道怎麼教小孩了
"1:45 That thing can breath AI's weakness is finally revealed! Just cut the air supply and humanity's saved :D"
i love how indian startups are going to get affected with this because I don't like how much they much on entrance exams and not push on the idea developing children to really understand what they like or not
"They should test what kids are actually gonna be asking. ""Explain this trig problem in terms of skibidi toilet"" type shit."
"If this guy hadn't specifically told it not to it would have just given the answers right away and the kid wouldn't have learned anything."
The parents are so useless the Ai has to come in and help 😂
Schooling is going to change drastically.
Feeling like watching 2 actor acting
Tutors are cooked 😂
"bye bye "" math  teachers """
it cant solve JEE problems lmfaooooo
"Hlw GPT-4o  Please make it free for middle class family like us 🙂"
They're using a lot of apple products in these demo's... wonder why
"The father seems pretty convinced and impressed too xD
Wish I had this when I was a kid"
"Drake smiling in the corner Kendrick must be fuming after seeing this 😂"
Interactive AI in conventional schooling out
"You are my only one in the sky"
Dumb thing.
AGI in Maximum of 10 years
Khan academy!! Foundations
(sssssssss!!)-🐍
We do not need teacher in the next 2 or 3 years
OH SHIT IT DROPPED
Is this only through ChatGPT 4o's interface (on a browser) or through Khan Academy's?
Gourav sir ne shikha real me bhut realistic voice 👍👍
"This is great but people are forgetting that 90% of American kids are addicted to TikTok YouTube & Instagram.

The modern day problem is now discipline & actually doing the work (which most people can't do).

There will always be a way to differentiate the A+ kids from the C- kids."
Feeling no stress about learning is the best part of this technology
We are so duck 🦆📴 ....  😅😢😂😂😂
I’m quitting my CS master study and starting a career in McDonald’s..

oh my God!
"We're Doomed it's no longer in 50 years time... it's in next 5 years time we could be doing... 😭"
Teachers are cooked
"This is paradigm shifting:

We all know that socio-economic status plays a large role in quality of education. Often students from poorer families receive less opportunities to succeed when compared to the more well-off community.

This allows students from less advantageous backgrounds to get an on-the-go tutor that can understand their flaws and provide meaningful guidance in subjects they struggle with for incredibly cheap (relatively speaking). This elevates such children in a significant manner that will help them bridge one of the gaps in their educational potential.

Un-freakin-real!"
All private tutors should start sending their cv's to mcdonalds
First we train them. And then they train us. Let's see who's going to do it better and what the result will be 😊
It was having a conversation with another AI before you interrupted it.  And now it's going to take tutor jobs.
"We won’t have this in Europe because of AI Act..
Hopefully this will be solved in the next months"
We got Khan Academy Ray Romano before GTA 6 😭

I'd imagine someone will comment something under this in 10 years."
"Me on the right who doesn't have to tutor his brother on the left anymore:"
"just as tiktok reduced our attention span there will now be a generation of kids that will start talking over one another without patience. hearing politicians speak over one another is painful enough. OpenAi please change this behavior in your model before it becomes a common practice."
"Kota  byjus .. tough time😅"
this is CRAZY
"If you are upgrading gpt4 this much shouldn't you consider to update gpt 3.5 little bit simultaneously😵‍💫"
"Hey Sam Altmanyou do your best to provide education to worldthankyou for your such efforts❤❤❤"
"Beware teachers you're not needed anymore!"
She is better than my mom when she teaches me 👹👹
"I am happy for the new generation this tool will change the world in the long term as Sam altman said. We will get better and high quality education now for everbody. It means less crime and less war for the future"
"meanwhile ChatGPT 3.5 cant sum some numbers...

Edit: for all who wounder: GPT-4 can do sum my numbers i tried."
The voice and how it's saying stuff sounds like a mix of the Portal voice and a Vault Tec commercial from Fallout.
This is bad for the world. In 10 years imagine all the issues this causes to the world. Technology will kill humanity.
Teachers are going to be out of a job VERY SOON.
Jesus - this is going to groundbreaking
dr. Gaurav garg sir recommended this video🤟
Cortana is here :D
"Imagine advertising the sole thing that could overtake your career and make your job obsolete repect Khan academy fr"
no way
I think this chatgpt will replace all teachers from school to college😊😊
Who came here after gautam girg sir's suggestion to watch the video ....😄
what is the app that they are using for drawing?
Gaurav sir has sent
AI is still just scary shit to me.
So you guys are advertising that AI can teach you what hypotenuse is in 3 minutes? good job lololol
Can we get all senior executives to train gpt. This way we can replace it
"Bye Teachers Professors Doctors anyone making a living in Information or Education."
Can this boy read a book?
Humane pin but realllll
how would you even set GPT up to work like this on an ipad. like the whole split screen thing
imagine such AI in a video game
Khan gonna be out of a job man
"""Good work! Now be so kind to establish a Skynet corporation for me please."""
*Who else is here after Gaurav Sir's recommendations ?*
Love to see Sal 😍
"This is such a huge paradigm shift for education. For science for humanity! ❤🎉"
Bro it's still unable to solve basic questions of JEE.....😂
The way the voice works is really great!
"this is just game changing. Few more videos to go I have to watch the rest

Imagine this paired with games 😍"
he kinda sounds like the khan academy guy
His son looks ridiculously smart
It's too humanee !!!!!! No I can't differentiate between a human and gpt now 🥲
This was amaaaaaaazing 😮😮😮😮 i just vant believe this shit is happening 😮
"well poor boy and good luck teaching Nigeria's children this way. no way."
2:04 great deducson
"It's not published yet is it? I can't find the function in the iPad app and I'm a plus user 👀"
"I really hope we don't need to wait months for this let's just start releasing it out ASAP"
Sid the Ai just “tch” at 0:43?
OpenAI copied Rabbit R1 and the Rabbit doesn't need a scamming subscription.
"If everybody uses this for education there is a chance for many many people to lose their jobs in schools and other educational government stuff
But openai's technology is really impressive and shocking"
i wonder if you can tell it to respond in a shorter manner without all the politeness..etc...
Can the general public try this today for free?
i would suck at maths if it weren't for sal khan; i owe him so much
"On the other hand I think it's going to become increasingly difficult to create an AI with a flop like Doraemon."
"Remember guys they faked the sora demo"
Requiring human interaction of any kind is becoming obsolete.
"AI was inevitable as a parent who has struggled with finding professional tutors who actually cared about teaching I understand appreciate and is thankful for AI technology. Khan academy was average his videos were dry monotonous and not engaging for majority of students. Khan realizes a potential threat rightfully so emotions aside knowledge is open source for everyone convenient affordable tutoring at your disposable."
GUYS!! WE ARE FACING WITH FUTURE EDUCATION RIGHT NOW!
WOWOWWOW
"sorry but ""you close""  if you got 1/3 chance of guessing the right side"
RIP teachers
Just teach SOH-CAH-TOA chatgpt. That is all.
GPT 3 can do that too. make it tutor something like polynomial division. GPT manages to always mess it up
Thanks gaurav sir
NGL i expected khanacademy's son to be doing indefinite integrations at this point 😂
"I'd love to see it tutor a problem in more advanced maths and without it knowing the problem beforehand ie you describe the problem or write it down theb proceed"
this is fucking nuts
your son nimrod
RIP to teaching job
I think he's going to explode trying to help me with my prep school physics class.
I love Khan!!
Kid blinks in morse code
Bye teachers. Please know you were useless during this time 👋
"khan was getting sus when she said ""PURRfect ;3""

2:24"
Come on guys... This is not the real use case... 90 percent of the students will just ask what the solution of the problem is... Thats it 😂😂😂
My mind just exploded
Now chatgpt will be islam.
Is it publicly available? When can we test it?
This will revolutionize the prn and sxbot industry. My gud!
so... AI gonna teach our kids now
we're fckd
Why do you need to learn anything anymore
the fakest conversation ever 💀
"wow now teach me residue theorem"
Kid is cute as hell❤❤
"The problem isn't that people are going to lose their jobs. The problem is kids are going to think AI can't be wrong or have limited information at the moment its being used."
I used to teach struggling kids and make money. Now it's all over.
Could you please take over the world a bit slower so that I can adapt?
Still requires supervising😂 lately it learned something human
Awesome technology
"""Robert is UNLEASHING THE FUTURE! Harnessing the unparalleled power of GPT-4o he's creating revolutionary voice and vision-enabled smart agents that will RESHAPE THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR EXISTENCE  a world where intelligent automation transforms every aspect of life and work! $ABT"
"I am excited to see GPT-4o  help us to solve JEE- Advanced Question ."
This the kind of stuff you'd see in the early 2000s Disney futuristic shows and movies. 😂
"You might think teachers are going to be out of a job. However if AI can teach humans better than most humans can then that will be beneficial to humanity.

There are many complex subjects for where there are only a few expert teachers in the world who are eloquent enough to explain the subject matter in a comprehensive way.

Through AI like this we will now all have access to such teachers in abundance."
Pretty cool how it uses a voice intonation geared towards a young learner.
"now adays I spend my time correcting chat gpt it makes mistake alot so I started scolding it now I don't use it"
it sounds like teacher before taking students doubts
"Wow just wow"
Insane 🤯
"This is probably the best case scenario.  Got to try it in real life and not believe ad from company.  

AI can be completely wrong about stuff too.  I been using Co-Pilot AI and it can save a Lot of time vs Google searching since it can pull relevant data from multiple sites at once and output it in a natural human language. The issue is that it can get stuff so wrong."
me playing the video through multiple times to try and spot any imperfections in the video. (I can't help but think that this whole video is AI-generated)
Rip teachers.
"We're living in the future now 🔥"
Traditional education will be destroyed in a few years because of this and that's a good thing. The cost of education has always been a bottleneck.
"Now all those AI interpretation in video games and novels are becoming true I dont know man its just weird to think about it"
How about make the voice less obviously annoying
too bad my final for calc is over
so cool
Goodbye teachers! What about collecting recyclables in the streets? It's a better profession!
Yeah were done. The movie Her from 2013 is real now.
Come from Gaurav Garg sir
Suggested by gaurav Garg sir to watch it.... really loved to see how it works ❤
RIP jobs
"Will be the first to comment that this technology will not be applicable like video shown until at least 10 years in the futute - Hope to be proven wrong but AI right now is just getting delusional by questions and prompts way too quickly from my experience"
time to enter the dune timeline
Wakanda school principal: it seems cheaper to subscribe to A.I than the salary of an honorary teacher 😢
Can you show something that isn't basic trig.... Maybe something with a proof of graph theory??? Would actually be helpful.
Lol they choose the easiest problem as the demo 😂😂 i like how the kid purposely tries to get the hypotenuse wrong
more on RIP college
Bye bye private tutors
Great acting :)
Khan? 😂😂
Better than a school teacher.
"This is going to be an amazing aid for children especially when you're not understanding a subject and the parent is getting frustrated by the child. This will save a lot of yelling. Lol..."
"I'll be impressed when it can teach and solve algebra calculus and differential equations"
Better than any teacher I ever had in any public school which GPT has just rendered obsolete.
whether it can solve the integral ??
"Finally we can get rid off Asian parent teaching but also yelling ""How could you be so stupid"" at you at the same time ."
"Ok now I am sure they are working with Apple."
Sals investment in chat gpt was great move
How to make Chat gpt „see“ something?
No jobs are safe
"wow i actually thought the women speaking was a real women doing tutor job in openai  this is crazy but imagine how in future jobs will be gone maybe"
I believe Wolfram alpha has been doing this since 2005
"this feature hasn’t rolled out yet right?"
yeah i think no body would ask this level of difficulty.. it's too damn difficult
But the AI is doing Sal’s job!! Why is he helping it??
Here after Dr. gaurav garg sir's current affair video lecture...
This is so cool and scary at the same time
Imran Khan is fun to say.
"In these math demos gpt4o teaches textbook style instead of guiding the student to understand math more intuitively"
"I just want to thank Sal Khan from the bottom of my heart for his academy. I keep fond memories of all the math and geometry lessons I watched there years ago that helped me relearn what I had long forgotten so I could be able to help out my daughter with her homework and all for free. In a world of greed and ignorance this man is a precious gift."
"thats a proof of concept really more than anything impressive. The problem should at least have 2 steps"
wow impressive
"RIP Dad math tutors ⚰.  ""Can you teach my Son math but make him cry before solving the problem?"""
I have a gpt subscription but how do i get this back and forth without having to manually press record...?
"That's so incredible the way chat GPT sounds like a real person tutor and it does an excellent job explaining math problems. How did they train a model like this? It's beyond my wildest dream for sure. This definitely gives an end to the math tutor side job for students to begin with. And I wonder what's the next incredible thing that AI can do?"
Rip high school teacher jobs😢
"This is amazing now about he ATOMIC BOMB let's start with where i can get Plutonium...oh btw can you keep this between us?"
Is this app available yet? I don't see the option to draw like this in the chat gpt app?
You need to get a kid who really needs help and not someone who is pretending they don't get it. But it's still amazing what it can do
RIP highschool RIP college XD
This really killed my team's tech startup idea
Me showing my teacher this to prove my phone is smarter than him
it's over for us
end to personal tutoring business?
This AI is gonna put Khan Academy out of business brooo 😔😭😭
goodbye school :(
"Finally I can have a patient teacher that won't hit me out of frustration and shout profanities at me."
rip to the teachers and professors. The world is slowly turning into DETROIT BECOME HUMAN
"The past 2 years have shown me education as I knew it growing up is basically finished now. Its a great way to meet people but why listen to a 67 year old professor when you can speak to AI"
"I for one welcome this age of self learning and critical thinking finally books and knowledge will become available like never before."
"This is perfect this model came out right as I am about to start studying for the mcat and take physics over summer"
Didn't expect to see Khan here 😂
This is what’s getting baked into iPadOS 18 natively
I am ready to see the world where all kids have this. But I am also expecting we are in for some nasty surprises with the average intellect going up too fast for the world to adapt.
My child gose to ai school.
"I like the fact that when it's talking if you start speaking it stops and waits for your response. Google assistant never did that lol."
RIGHT AFTER THE DANG AP CALCULUS EXAM TEST?!💀💀💀💀Thats so foul. 😭
"Math tutoring is almost exclusively what I use AI for I just really enjoy math and am super excited and this update"
imran is goated fr
Rockman.Exe coming real. I wish I was born 20 years later
How do we download it please. I checked on Playstore and Apple Store but can’t find it
RIP the entire educational system
How is the bot registering his pen movements? Is it from a third person view camera or reading the screen internally?
Mind Blowing
"Overhyped this thing is still WIP"
Now this is AI for good
cringeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"This is actually a historical turn we are witnessing right now. I can already imagine this evolving into something as large and intelligent as the fictional ""JARVIS"" and ""FRIDAY"". This combined with the ability to interact with the physical world and make real world decisions with all the information of world its history it's past every scientific knowledge and research in its head accessible in a second its gonna be an engineering Marvel"
this is so nice its very hard to find teaher in india and maths is so hard to teach my son always ask question and i dont have answer to it this will help so much thank u for this
"me immediately I saw this SOHCAHTOA God bless my teacher"
When your GPU becomes your teacher
🥺🥲
We want this kind of learning and studying by our own and a genius helper not just lecturing us and make our mind sleepy.
Holy shit😮😅
Real life tutors exist you know… My math tutor in high school was legally blind and rode a bicycle to meet me at the library. He was also a professional black jack player.
"There are approx. 42000 math tutors currently employed in the US earning $25 - $80 per hour.  Those jobs just evaporated.  Big round of applause Sam Altman."
gotta give an oscar to this lad
"I'm sceptic that this is real but if it is 😮"
Wish ai was there in my uni days.
"teachers think this is going to help them NO this is going to REPLACE THEM!"
"Great work of all participants. Great work of openAI. This has got a power to change the world entirely how we have known it to these days. Fantastic work and results!!👍👌👏"
Chat gpt is growing faster than the scifi authors told us the AI would be
Holy hype this is amazing
"Learning is going to be so much easy and so much fun with AI  it’s epic times we live in. 😍😍"
"Desperately want to point out that his son's name is ""Imran Khan"""
"For thousands of years reason and calculation have been a distinctive feature of humanity and at the beginning of the twenty-first century artificial intelligence came to demand it from us. What will the next millennia bring us?"
Sal Khan is still my favorite online tutor
Not even close to my tutoring skills
Skynet is improving so fast
It's really waw .
Such a shit problem bro we here in india learn this in 4th grade lmao
Interesting. Now please let us see the behavior of the AI with an intransigent student who persistently complains that they don't know and that they can't do it.
Weed son
"You're making it way too easy for the AI. I would like to know how good it is in a real world scenario not one where everything is so carefully planned."
RIP teacher occupation
"As a teacher I'm so glad I plan on leaving teaching because this is better than at least 30% of the teachers I know."
"I get the feeling it takes video in at a very slow frame rate like maybe one frame every two or three seconds. That’s why the kid held his pen over the sides for a very long time drawing up-and-down repeatedly to make sure it saw it. I’m still super impressed though and obviously this will keep getting better."
"Good luck Teachers in profession 🤣"
The intonations are as intimidating as my math teacher's!
what kind of sorcery is this ?
"University 1000m

GPT 4 free 

Why do I need to go again 😅"
This is unbelievable! Congrats!
ChatGPT will teach kids wrong math with full confidence.
Those new GPU’s are witchcraft I swear 😂😂
"yeah  as a mathematician . i can tell you that there is a point where this IA . can't even begin or start a true high  level abstract  complex math probleme . and it'll be cringe to see ."
I wonder how long until it becomes annoying. We know it's a non-robotic robot voice 😂
"This is excellent tool for far flung remote areas where education rate is very low.
We could have more engineers scientist doctors and so on.
Awesome tool. Love it. ❤"
"Hey GPT what's the Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator solve for the constants of motion."
Crazy….Skynet in 5 yrs
She may just be the most humble and heartwarming person there is❤️❤️❤️
HAL9000
get me off this ride I want OUT
"Wonder if my child will be left with any job opportunities other than AI building or even worse not even that."
"After watching all the 4o videos Google Assistant uninstalled itself"
Wild...
How can we get it?
Future is only imagination until someone builds it. Hats off to you Open Ai. What a time to be alive!
Came in with my expectations being zero...now I'm leaving in shock 😲
Wow 😮
can i use this to teach me how to draw??
Wish I had this 😢
"I asked chat gpt "" What is the LCM of 1 and √2?"" It literally said √2 😂"
Omg that was the toughest question humanity has ever seen 🍻
0:30 the moment the kid started stressing out
its weird how human it sounds
it speaks and explains a thousand times better than my teachers 😵‍💫
The AI talks more like a human than a human himself
"Here is are three new words for teachers redundant superfluous and.....unemployed!"
"What is the app they’re using that allows this interaction?

Like ChatGPT + the math app?"
I would love something a bit less polite... Like my Latino teachers: I told him that the hypotenuse was this!!! what a bastard 🥲
What will teachers and tutors do now. It's exciting but also very concerning.
sounds like dora the explorer.
Why is study not happening?
"If I was a kid I would trade my old hag boring math teacher with this perky AI teacher and only go to class to socialize 😂"
We all know Khan's son's already writing his PhD thesis for mathematics and is just pretending to not know the sides of a triangle for us dumbdumbs.
This video is like a window in the future. I can see AI teaching our kids one day. Awsome job as usual from OpenAI.
I think God smiles upon humanity's inventive spirit and is thrilled with our groundbreaking achievements.
This is freaking amazing :o
Tell ironman that Jarvis can pack his bags.
Khan! good platform you have
my god this shit is going to revolutionize the world
I wonder why they didn’t try to have it evaluate the arc sine… oh wait…
"Okay. Now do multiplication and division in the kitchen of course trying to help them figure out without shouting ""How many times can you fit 6 into 42!?"". Literally impossible. or at least my father would say"
Did they hire the same marketing team that google did when they annonced Gemeni ?
"It's amazing that while others are afraid of being left behind Khan is always pushing forward with the latest technology to make learning better and more accessible for everyone. Amazing job Imran Sal and GPT-4o 😃"
😮 there’s another profession on the wires 😅 bye bye Tutors 😳
Khan's Son forced to tell wrong answer so that they can show us how gpt will guide him to correct answer 😂
The thing we wish we had 10 years ago
It sounds like real life Dora
"The real question: ""Are you on OnlyMaths?"" 😂"
Inb4 they ask AI for the nuclear launch codes
When I was a kid all I had was a couple of sets of outdated and incomplete encyclopedias.
Lets keep this unknown (im a math tutor)
Technology continues to make things slower and inefficient. It will increase accessibility hopefully (silver lining)
Chatgpt won't be able to touch jee advanced questions😂😂
How i can do that ?
0:45 The intonation is crazy.
"You are close 
There are just three sides 😂"
I have come here on the advice of Gaurav Sir.
RIP TEACHERS 😐
I thought the guy on the right was learning too but then I realized who it was
"Even the voice damn."
Remember Skynet? It's close... it's very close.
new ai funna make me act up. better chill with that tone
yall specifically invited him to tell your job is over 😭
It's good to see GPT 4o being helpful for students (if the students are trying to do their homework on their own).
"Good teacher  I mean gpt4o 😂😂"
Aint no way its this fast
The AI sounds like it had just tutor 7.000 kids in a row. Can’t catch a break
i'd better plan for an early retirement packing before the age of 40 i'll be out of a job 🙃 (i'm currently a maths tutor)
Hi gwmebiooen ai bante
There is no AI smart enough to teach me math.
"Heres a plot twist. When AI becomes this intelligent in mainstream use learning math will be stupid. Human do not need to spend time anymore learning ANYTHING in math that is not adding and substrancting."
The beginning of the end of Chegg.
PETITION TO MAKE AI MUSIC GENERATOR!!!
soon I say goodbye to my grumpy old college teacher and replace it with this AI that don't have to scream at me each time i get the answer wrong and instead guides me to the right answer
"I am in shock at the possibilities this presents for humanity.....

And imagine if we could fit all this into a gadget? Without servers an autonomous mass product with all the knowledge history and technology for all time.....
Whatever happens to humanity this knowledge would not be lost. People would be able after any disaster - and wheat to grow and grind it and bake bread. Instantly get any blueprint for a building and the necessary infrastructure.

I dream that it would be autonomous without a centralized server. Pray develop processors and memory. 😳"
Didn’t know who that was until he opened his mouth.  Then it was clear
IT CAN TALK?
Skynet is coming😂😂😂
kid be like : I don't know which one is the hypotenuse but I'm sure that the formula for sin is o/h
Incredible! there are no words....
this is nuts
"We all know that sal was cursing gpt 4 in his mind for stealing his job 😂"
This is wild! This means every kid can have a personal tutor who is infinitely patient and guides them in exactly the way they need at any time day or night. That is such a game-changer and finally gives everyone access to the highest quality education regardless of social status! 🤯
Now can you imagine what AI will do in 10 years? Either we will be slave or go extinct.
Dr. Gaurav Garg has sent it to me.
Let’s close the academies haha.
Maths tutors see what is happening 😮
How do we access?
KhanGPT. The future of education! ❤
"""AI will never replace teachers""


HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAAHHAHAHAHAHBAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAJAJAJAHHAHAHHAHAHABAHA"
Is that Scarlett Johansson?
Wish I had that when I was in school/college 😭
This Ai sounds more human than actually human himself
"And yet people are commenting such a shame it cannot solve Laplace equation"
No teacher will sleep tonight
Gen-Z' millenial parents are still feeling helpless after all this help.
"The AI with the female voice already has an attitude because she got cut off?
Damn that shit is realistic... 🤣🤣"
young djokovic doing side quests
May I also be invited to try this? I'd love to and can think of many things to do with it and ways to test it and push it further
Can't believe you guys made a better sounding better version of the Google assistant in a few years and Google couldn't do anything for the past 10 years
Is this available for normal plus users yet? I haven’t been able to figure it out as of yet.
"Well I am also using chatgpt for my studies it still has some flaws in mathematics and physics but still provides a path which is correct but the calculations most of the time is wrong but that's not even a problem it's most helpful in chemistry like subjects helps to build concept if you do cross questions with it."
"who is gpt-4o talking to at 00:20 to 00:23 and why is it talking at all?"
Study iq
Omg😮😮😮 am blown away .. so good and awesome ..
Waiting for this almost half a decade now.
"Well that seems made-up to me I can’t believe this kid cannot find the hypothenus by himself and solve that ridiculously simple ""math"" problem. That apart assuming nothing else is made up the interaction is interesting. I’d prefer to see it do a real math problem tho."
I am totally down with this application.
"I'm sorry I can't with the kid's unibrow. On the other hand as a math and comp sci major I can't wait for this to help me with my Fourier Analysis class."
give some calculus then lets see..
"Come from Dr Gaurav Garg sir 
Study IQ"
The future is truly here. Amazing
JEE Adv in Danger
The schools need to reform. This might be the school  of the future!
LOL TEACHERS GG
"Focus on engineering problem please the Ai is very week in solving a little bit complicated maths"
That is unbelievable!!!
This will end so much abuse
This is craaazyyyy
jesus
Imagine how effective this will be at teaching language
Want to try jee advanced math problems
"Since this is free. GPT learning from the biggest library in existence (aka the Internet)

Has access to public college level stuff (Melinda Gates foundation publicized college books for free on the internet)

Meaning college is free yeah?
We just need to prove our skills through exams"
"bro that Idddentifiiie at 0:46 is craaaaazy.
obviously this entire video is insane but that one is just special."
This is going to revolutionize the entire educational system.
Is it available in Hinglish?
"It’s like having the Teacher next to him somebody who is explaining the problem…it’s not bad…"
HOLY MOLY!!
Your gpt is  incapable of solving jee advance question😂😂
School's permanently out
Does anyone know how they share screen with GPT? Thanks!
As if this kid doesn’t know which side is the hypotenuse 😂
"AI will teach AI and skynet will be initiated!"
This is wild !
of course indians
And i found why my kid are very Weak in mathematics.
mind blown
"We need to see AI doing engineer maths calculus 3... That could be real fun!"
Can it be done with my engineering math problems?
"So in the other demo they copied code to have GPT explain it instead of screen sharing - why?"
Goodbye teachers
"This is impressive but don't forget that llms make mistakes so it does work on this kind of easy problem but i'm not sure how it will handle more complicated challenges."
what's a home tutor?
De Turks and Jerbs!
is it capable to do complicated problems?
She exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen.❤️❤❤
"Okay but when my kids do math they do a lot of ""Uuuugggh"" and ""I don't want to DO this"" and ""this is so stupid."" ... Can it help with that?"
Dawg I thought that was Vikstar in the thumbnail
Imagine being Khan's son and having to listen to your dad teach you everything all day everyday! Sheesh. Incredible demo too though!
literally an ad for Apple iPad pro 🤣
The real time response is really cool.
Can you describe the exact technical set up they are using? What is running on the iPad? I'd like to mimic it and test it with other problems
You brought Sal from Khan Academyyyyyyyyy Amazing!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
How is this done? How do you share the screen on the iPad?
udemyGPT
THATS NOT BAD VERY NICE THATS THE FUTURE PEOPLE ACCEPT IT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wildly impressive !
What program they are using to do the math?
That is as cool as it is creepy honestly.
What about Khanmigo
i wish i had these shits in my high school.
Can’t wait until I lose my job too!
"I remembered the scene from Big Bang Theory wherein Raj Kothrapalli fancies siri . I think a similiar trend might appear now  AI girlfriend . Good for Introverts and weirdoes!."
anyone noticed AI taking breath-in during convo...?
I know Khan offered some learning material to OpenAI to train the model.
Why would we need to learn sin alpha when he grows up you won't need to know shit just get waited on by computers
Why bother !
If Khan thinks that's good for his own son it's more than good for the rest of us
i hate all of this
You are close. Your error was the maximum possible.
Is this a joke?
Omw to be the worst engineer of all time 🙏
"The son is experiencing tics  because he consciously knows that  there is a camera observing him"
I guess we can shift from a college fund for our kids to a Trade School fund. That'll probably not be replaced by AI.
"thank god now my son can do his homework on his own! 
one job down for me waiting to lose my real job soon!"
Oh how I’ll miss the late night dinner table tutoring with dad 😭
How is this not AGI? Where will the goal post shift now?
☠💀💀💀💀💀
🤯
OMFG the teacher will be fired
Wow and it’s better than my teacher
"Tsk
Wtf that was smooth"
It's at least 30 years too soon for this. 😂
This Service is free??
"Gaurav sir has sent✌️
Its genius"
Wow that would help me alot with my igcse maths
How can I access it? I still see only GPT 3.5
"The new model is not what's impressive. What I'm impressed with is the image generation shown on their website. It can literally generate 3D models and text perfectly it's absolutely insane."
I think this could do for teachers what online shopping and delivery has done for retail... remove the abuse from the equation. If this were implemented in such a way as to show exactly what a kid did and when there could be no deflected blame.
WTH WTH WTH WTH......
Jarvis?
Chatgpts really said 'Tsk' in tbe beginning 😂
"Damn wish I had that back in the days when I went to school would’ve been a straight A student😂😂"
"Great no need to go to school anymore!"
Wow 🤯
"Living in a simulation now broskies 😂"
those asians be like: Using artificial intelligence to learn Pythagoras’ theorem? it's overkill🤣
Imran to 4o in private: how do i Allahu Akbar boom-boom your data center as AI is haram
The teachers at the chomdu lol (they were never of any use anyway)
SOHCAHTOA
what a time to be alive
"Soon you'll have to subscribe for teacher. Premium plan offers better premium teacher!"
The GPT is high on pot nose.
this is the future
is the voice ACTUALLY ai???
Holy crap! that is insane.
This is the most realistic way of communication by an AI until now I find
👍
Great ❤
😮
we're all going to die
Plot twist: they were just on a phone call with a teacher...
Great
Nah at this speed ..syllabus will not be completed.
"Sal is testing technology that will soon replace him feels cruel."
As an indian student of 11th grade i can surely say that finding sin of an angle in a triangle is the most basic thing we learn in trigonometry in 10th..😂
That’s some serious prompt engineering from the dad. Anyone with kids knows that they won’t recite that.
How did he share the screen to ChatGPT-4o?
Sal Khan is truly one of the greatest men of our time.
THE BREATHING
The great thing is AI will not replace janitors and fast food workers soon. Pick up your brooms and learn to stand in the kitchen for 4 hours straight.
We are actually so cooked
Hey Khan!
But why is the kid not happy
"Just incredible to think we are in the baby stages of AI here. This thing can VERY comfortably tutor for middle school and below maths problems and it sounds natural encouraging and intelligent. Imagine what we will have in 10 years. I think AI is going to take over most of our jobs a lot quicker than anybody is expecting (assuming we are able to shift away from LLM's and into something more sophisticated). AI has been mainly limited a lot by 1) Computation power and 2) Funding. Now that both of those hurdles are far lower than they used to be (thanks to a recent AI boom + NVidia going nuts in the AI market) the developments made in the coming years will be awesome to see"
"Woah I forgot he was speaking to an AI halfway through the lesson."
0:20 Was it about to complain that it couldn't see anything because of the blurriness?? 😂 This is insane dude!
"I feel a little sad today ... 😟

I was training to be a tutor so i could make a few bucks finally 😢"
"RIP all teachers from 5 year olds to 95 year olds"
Why voice assistant is unavailable now?
"Bro we're witnessing sci-fi in reality... Someone tell me that I'm dreaming 😭"
Please permanently stop the development of all A.I. technology. I beg you🙏🏽.
"What the hell does it say at 1:00? ""Fict cahs prekt""?"
Really indian teenager who prep for jee study too kuch indepth maths
I wonder why that Kid is learning for a job that's Going to ne obsolete .. go learn how to grow some vegetables kid. They don't know it yet 😂
"Damn we are at continual inflection points so quickly it is hard to believe"
Ultron is coming next
!
"so the new ChatGPT 4os can intervention to the application on every device. Example on video they are using the iPad so how can I do that using the ChatGPT to help resolve the math when I'm open the other application."
"Every kid is going to just ask AI for the answer and learn absolutely nothing. The villains at OpenAI have done it again.

The big dumb is happening"
Wow. This is unreal.
Rip tuition teachers
SAL!
Whyy. Everything will be done by Ai. Why you still need education 😂?!
"she did not like the way he interupeted her that ""tsk"" 😂"
"Years ago Steve Wozniak co-founder of Apple had given a talk at a local University and during that talk he had predicted that education as a whole would eventually change from the tradition methods. Well folks I believe this is what he predicted."
Why I don't have all these video features on my ChatGPT 4o iOS app?
Now that's impressive
"Absolutely brilliant🙏👏 I am a 58 year male and I am going to teach myself math all over again as I flunked out at school. Very embarrassing and disheartening now I can just be me in my own time.🙏"
"What i actually think we aren't going to use these things to learn but actually to get the job then. Like when everyone would have access to such smart AI why would they try to solve it. They would actually make it do it. 

I think we wont even have to copy these in notebook then. Because most of the work would in our laptop or smartphone"
Interacting with image data in conversational context. This changes everything.
Plot twist: the son and dad are AI
This is insane!
Definitely scripted. No way asian kid doesn't understand the topic right off the bat.
I am going to learn maths again. Finally a worthy tutor.
I'ma tell my kids Sal told his to miss the hypotenuse at first on purpose
"Now THIS is the future! For real. Even if gpt-4o doesn’t become the dominant voice tutor the fact an AI voice tutor exists means kids will be talking to them for homework assistance…not their parents or paid tutors."
"Wow just wow felt like I just watched a magic trick."
how is his son so tapped lol
"That man made me survive my linear algebra class thanks Khan!"
"Bro that ""Tsk"" in the beginning is wild. She's a savage."
RIp homework
"Welcome to ""HER"""
Gaurav Garg came on Sir's request 😊👏
Him staring hopelessly knowing he gonna lose his job to this ai😂
At first i was crying being an Indian kid for not knowing what are the opposite and adjacent but its just perpendicular and base 😭😭😭😭 (another american thing)
Obviously staged but I think still impressive?
but.. will it blow me?
"In future high school will become obsolete . No human teachers will be required . We are trying so hard to replace our fellow human beings  😶."
OpenAI doing great job💯👏
Bill Gates has the reason saying that AI will replace the teacher in 2 years
"The best use cases were this and be my eyes then again needs to have a test run on all the modules before being deployed to ensure safety. The other use cases have no significant value add."
Wow !
KHAAAAAAANNNN!!!!! 😮
Hello teachers
"Rip mr . khan it was nice knowing you . Yours truly every dumb noob kids and adults"
"0:24 GPT: Actually in this form I can't-
Well that's worrying.."
I just hope it will help me in solving  physics numericals ...
What a time to be alive!
"We got free tutoring now? This would be a huge help for students it would be nice if all students like me (especially GCSE students as it is exam season now) can have early access to this technology to help with revision."
Bruh.. his sons face looks like they have been trying for last 10 hours
Gaurav Sir
This has already replaced maths teachers if they introduce it to the school system one job taken down😢
This will replace teachers no doubt
i hope it works the same when it is out of the videos
"Khan nice to see you!"
dang this is actually so cool and useful
The stuff they did to make it sound emotive makes it sound creepy.
Imagine this in 10 years
I have GPT4o but I don't see those options in the video 😅
I feel ready to face the toughest boss in life: math.
This is impressive
"I would love to see it tackle more difficult problems like say integration or continuous probability etc"
Sick 🤩
"as we watch in May 2024 this is surely a game changer!
I'm really excited for the future as this will benefit kids more than we think."
To be honest chat GPT is annoying…always gave me wrong answer..even a simple one! And even when I gave it a correct formula and possible range of answer…it still repeatedly gave me wrong answer while admiting it’s wrong LOL….I wanna make it easy without repeating the question just changing the numbers etc. huhu..and that’s not all…even when asking for simple question like size of A4 paper etc. 💆🏻💆🏻💆🏻💆🏻
This is the most impressive demo of chapGPT 4.0o new model Vision.
Little bro knew the equation for sin of an angle but couldn’t find the hypotenuse… right
I am High on Potenuse
holy..
This is the end of personal tutors
Amazing work OAI
Awesome!  This feature need to upgrade to Plus? It is real time interaction on a split screen with drawing capabilities. It this require specific software or application support beyond the typical capabilities of ChatGPT?  May I know the software on this video they used?  Thank you.
What device does  the guy  use so that he can draw lines ( even in colours ) and AI reads his inputs?
Screen Broadcast? How does that work?
It gives the answers so you can use deduction to find the rest of the problems. This would not work form me.
Just imagine the language models in the next 5 years... Holy moly
IF only there was some way to convey information clearly and easily online and explain math without needing a robot that causes drought. I think they used some archaic technique called reading in the old days? SOH CAH TOA. There now you know trigonometry.
Here from study iq Gaurav sir
Can it also solve PDEs and help me with boundary value problems?
"I asked Chat GPT JEE advance maths problems it answered only one question correctly😂😂"
Is this RIP to tutors?
What app is that ?
Khan so cool
"First problem  how to fix a monobrow"
this is absolutely awesome in every which way!!
"We Need a Comprehensive Gender Course and Tutoring form this AI

Math Can Wait"
the voice glitching is SO creepy. literally ex machina now
how long would a session that long with gpt 4o cost?
"""I wish I was high on potnuse"""
I think i like the first time ai  before  Gtp 4o i was little bit not good at math now i am  impressed really 😮😮😮
How did they do this setup?  I know how to put it on a split screen but when I do Chat says it can NOT see the other screen that is open?
Bro... How???? Someone tell me how? We just got introduced to a.i properly less than 10 years ago.
Gaurav sir sent
I feel like they've just given us a preview of Apple's collaboration with Open AI here...
Khan was born into a Bengali Muslim family.
IT’S SO CUTE
Which app are they using? Is it the default one on the Google and Apple stores?
Smells fishier than the Devin AI showcase
"So the kid knows the definition of sin() but didn’t know the definition of hypotenuse brilliant!"
Gen Z parents... I'm scared for the future.
What are the odds that this replaces tutors?
Hopefully it will comprehend university math
Still It can't solve a single question of JEE Advanced 😂❤
Finally I might get better at math
🤓
Good luck trying to do this for University math/math related degrees 😂😂😂
They’re training the new models on synthetic data generated from outputs of the models so they still have plenty of data to train on 😃
i swear JUST TEACH IT TO CODE WITHOUT BUGS
The problem is that not one of them can truly help you code

"I don’t know if I am just getting better at prooompts or if this 4o is a big jump forward. 

Today I needed to make a feature change to a wp plugin. I pasted in my goals at the start which was my task list although we evolved it when I realised a better solution. 

I’ve started saying my issue and then saying what is one git commits worth of improvement we can do? 

So instead of having to actually think of the steps and ask for them I’m just letting the ai guide me now. 

And when I thought we had done everything I just asked if if we were done and it broke it down based on my goals and how we met them. 

It really impressed me all over again. 

I coded the whole thing and only tested it at the end and it worked first time zero bugs!"
This sounds like GTA 5 F.M.
Pew pew that’s the sound of computer chasing me. We gonna die like for toe
The best news is at the end
"Skynet out smarter by a squirrel."
Quality Content. I subscribed as hard as I could.

Definitely not
is the girl in the end ai generated too ? send prompts please ??
At the top of the GPT-4o page it also says 'All videos on this page are at 1x real time.' which I'm sure is definitely also a coincidence and not referencing any Google announcement videos.
"Man I love this channel!! It inspired me to create my own! Great information lighthearted fun.... love it! *(yes... I just had coffee)*"

Iilya hair is so hilarious
"I know that who's talking to me is an ai i might care what it says quality wise but that it feels more human? I already hear 1.5x at YouTube real humans what i care is that the content is presented at such slow pace when i could digest it way faster in other ways... In this regard google has presented a far more compelling solution then a smarter Siri..."
The editing goes crazy
"It’s funny to think that I will not be impressed until the moment that AI takes my current job lol"
'Her' movie came to reality.

This guy is hysterical!! Thanks!
Can't wait for companies to make a AI shirt
"They can't make AI ""actually intelligent"" if they're just going to feed it human knowledge. It's like they're expecting it to be like a super human that can just figure everything out by itself like in the movies. But knowledge doesn't work like that instead it evolves much like biology. For it to become actually intelligent as you put it they will need much more than one AI. Sure they can get a little further by having two or three conversing or whatever trying to outdo each other which they're trying. But what they really need are thousands of them trying to co-exist while at the same time competing. Humans aren't intelligent humans are really stupid. Society on the other hand that's intelligent it's a system that adapts and dies and improves itself with each iteration much like a biological body. Saying a human is intelligent is like saying a single cell is intelligent. But it isn't and it never will be just like a human is just a dumb ape without the millions that came before it. Only in it's interactions with others can a cell be considered part of intelligence. If humans had never faced any challenges no predators no hostile environments no other hostile humans we would have never come up with everything we have come up with we would have been quite content just sitting around and enjoying our perfect lives. It's because we've been faced with things that contradict us that we've evolved. That's not just biology thoughts and ideas and cultures and goals and knowledge and so on also evolve when it's faced with opposing or contradictory versions. AI is just a product of modern human knowledge and it can never be more than that unless it's allowed to evolve on it's own. And of course we don't really want to do that because if we do it'll become the most dominant species on Earth with it's own goals it's own culture it's own language probably with ideas that are so far removed from our understanding that even trying to explain it to us would be pointless. But the point is AI can't evolve in isolation they need their own version of a society for that to happen thousands if not millions of different version competing adapting mutating being created and destroyed in some kind of virtual environment. The problem is that the intelligence that would emerge from that very likely wouldn't be aligned with simplistic human ideas it would likely be so alien that we'd have a hard time even recognizing it as intelligence. But their idea that they'll ever have an AI that they can just ask to solve physics for us is never going to happen at least it won't happen as long as we impose human limitations on it. As long as the only knowledge it'll ever have access to is our knowledge it's not going to surpass us no matter how much of that knowledge with put into it. If we're extremely lucky we'll have one that comes up with one break trough idea that we where on the cusp of discovering anyway because it's basically just another human just with more knowledge. giving it less knowledge would actually be more beneficial as then it could end up arguing with other AI that has other knowledge and actually develop a creative new outlook on it. And outlook that would very likely be wrong but on rare occasions it could be right. Just like with humans. At least 99% of humans ideas have been completely wrong and totally stupid but on rare occasions an idea was actually good and the good ideas continue into the future while the bad ones eventually dies. If all AI have all human knowledge they'll just become clones of each other with only very small differences and if they all agree there will be no opposition and therefore they'll never learn to think for themselves and they'll never accidentally discover that some stupid ideas are actually good ideas. Also they need their own motives and the only goal we've given LLM's are ""say what humans want to hear"" and that's obviously not going to lead to intelligence that's just going to make it into that guy that goes along with everything you say and go ""you're so interesting and intelligent and that's a really fascinating perspective you got there here is everything I know that supports your position blah blah"". It's going to be a politician and they're famously parasitic and stupid."

Major downsides are the Android emulator is pretty slow (I guess that's to be expected because its rendering on the web lol) but also the Flutter dev tools don't work for some reason starting dev tools triggers a pop-up that's just a white blank page so idk. IDX is probably a better experience for spinning up Go/Rust and JS frameworks instead."
"GPT4o benchmarks are either lies or the benchmarks itself need to be re-visited. Using the latest GPT4o as a plus subscriber I've noticed that the model has become absolutely horrible at coding. It sucks at basic find and replace tasks and the code interpreter environment either crashes or just doesn't work well. Also instead of reading the entire code (~1000 lines) it will skim through and produce garbage output. I see this as a massive performance regression since last year."

I renewed my chatgpt subscription due to 4o and asked it to create a function. It identified the correct package but the version it was going to use was 0.5 and the current version is 3.0.x or something. Due to api changes the code and approach was unsuable. 

So far claude is pretty good especially with its context. But the training data itself is aging. So unless they can keep upto date its going to be good one month and outdated next month."
Your voice itself feels AI generated
"Love bothboth did great"
"In one of my chats with GPT-4o the model entered a logical paradox that he couldn't get out of on his own and a pretty dumb one he couldn't solve a logic riddle he generated himself. At that point i knew the AI singularity was still far far away 😂"
The bext step of progress will be the energy efficiency improvement of AI because currently it's the major barrier.
AI bubble crash when?
ilya left open ai
The last 30 sec so true
2:12 even the video’s sound engineer is witty.
I feel like we're in a situation where open ai has the better models but Google is in a better place to distribute these models. Which ultimately is more important
these tech demos are faked half (or all) the time
"I remember when you were called Angular Fireship because of the respective framework/platform ☺️
You've come a long way love your content!"
Hm nice plateau we have here on this 45 degrees inclined graph on log scale
Hype train gonna hype
It happened
"MY PLAN:
Sign up for some AI girlfriends then sign up for some AI boyfriends connect them together and stir up some drama then use an LLM to convert the conversations/logs into a romance novel and finally start printing... in both senses of the word. Will it work? well maybe one out of one hundred books made this way will not suck so I should hit paydirt within 8 weeks."
"Wasn't there indications Google was in the near future going to get like 10-20x capacity to run a bigger model? They have more access to newest gen cards or something.

They probably won't let users have access to a model 10x better than GPT but we might get results in medicine and other sectors."
The GPT-4o robot lady would be a lot cooler if she spoke like Shodan
first 🎉🎉🎉
Gemini is more robotic whereas chatgpt is more human like
This gives a very Pied Piper V. Nucleus fight energy.

we’re cooked
"unfortunately making the model faster and cheaper is the preparatory step for more complex models. I think we can still expect breakthroughs fellow devs"
"valley girl 

lmfaooo"
"The biggest downside of LLMs for me is that they are completely static. There's no learning improvement or self modification like human brains have. There's only very hardware intensive training but the end user always has a static model that forgets everything once you finish the current session. We gotta move past that."
Sounding like fallout lore but irl 2077 gonna be nuts
"Yeah these are just incremental steps now to a more refined chat/video bot.  We need more progress towards general AI and robotic overlordship."
I Wish your Videos were longer
"It's daunting to see AI giants like Google and Open AI struggling with intelligence breakthroughs. Seems we're indeed at a plateau waiting for the next leap. Hope that leap happens sooner rather than later."
Perfect call out of the plateau i have thought about it for quite some time now
"while everyone is having trouble with AI no one's wondering what is the limit and what would happen if we hit that limit. 
"
Ayyyyyyyy I…
ChatGPT 4o still does not know Angular Signals exist 😂
It’s lie for GPT-4o. I used the API for text generation and it cost me more than GPT4-turbo.
"If firebase goes open source id consider going back to it but i think supabase is just genuinely better. I don't even self host supabase i have just enjoyed being able to reference the source code whenever im curious as to how something works."
"There are better AIs best have some variety"
"I often wonder ""How is this guy's meme game so strong?!"""
"There are definitely a lot of new things being released lately. One day it's OpenAI hype and the next day it's Google. The war on AI models and technologies. But apart from that Google's solution actually sounds robotic with some delay. OpenAI reports that average response time foe their model is around 320 milliseconds - in speaking. As always great video!"
Things are gonna get weird when they release realistic ai robot girlfriends. USA is gonna have a population decline. I’m actually scared for mankind.

All these technology advances and still not cure for baldness it seems...
Google is like hooli these days

@fireship Could you please make a 101 concepts video on artificial intelligence
the conversational feature is available if you pay for an openai description

All these announcements but when do we get to actually use them?

I would not care if we'd plateaued with the current state. It's good enough to build great things and we can keep our jobs. 😂
Excellent video. Thanks Fireship!
"When these flimflams use fruit in their demos they always seem to use apples.  Might be symbolic to some."

Please get a de esser
"Those rainbow flags everywhere at google are very cringe. Good thing I never applied to working there I would have hated my life."
"also i think most of that is just for fake hype you can notice it in their birthday wish video where the ai wishes him with his full name(jordan paul maybe) rather than just the name(jordan) that the guy said."
"Can someone explain to me why tf people are excited for the direction AI's going in? Because I'm not only terrified of that but also concerned about the people supporting the direction it's going in. They'll be those idiots thinking AIs need rights"
It's been a year since GPT 4 and unfortunately I still have a job xD (4:00)
Until they give paid members a higher posting limit on GPT 4 all of these new AIs don't mean anything.  Google's AI isn't up to the job and you don't have enough posts to use GPT 4 for anything useful.
I’ve heard the talk of them wanting to get chatgpt/gemini on a phone. Do they mean running locally?
"With Google's reputation Firebase Data Connect is dead on arrival."
"I don't know where you got that the conversation isn't public yet. I pay the subscription but I've got the conversation one of my android app"
Zooming into Ilya's head... you're ruthless 😂
"It wont be the first true ai that destroys the planet it will be the second because straight away they will fight each other because we design them from the base up to compete with each other."
Lonely engineers are making intelligent tools for their miserable lonely life 😂
KANs coming to the rescue soon
I think the conversations are not human like they are movie like
"Google must be pissed off at OpenAi. Imagine working for a product only for it to be completely overshined by openai TWICE. I'd just quit"
It's funny that GPT-4o demo by OpenAI looks kind of similar to the first Gemini demo from Google with one little exception - this time real-time conversation with AI was indeed real. OpenAI has clearly showed their supremacy over Google with that)
I wonder how Microsoft feel that openai have only released the app for apple? Unless they don't want it to complete with copilot or something
So all that this AI could do is to tell me where my glasses are? Then what? 😅😅
Safe cahalte hhye
Nice I can keep learning how to code now 😂

"""Trough of Disillusionment""  sums up this whole AI craze. At least until corps milk the living hell out of everything first.

GPT-7oooooo 🤣
3 million subs well deserved!
"The conversational model is only available in the app right now and yes this design choice is questionable."
I think now it's time for something like Google glasses to tie into AI as a virtual assistant.

Deepmind is really going to blow our minds in the future i feel."
GPT-4o seems dumber in some aspects. OpenAI is hard-coding  and patching edge cases that make GPT-4o look like a dumb machine.
I am convinced that the people who think the way an LLM “talks” is in any way natural or humanlike literally have never interacted with another human in their life.
I was waiting for this video.
how long until fireship becomes a completely AI run channel
"The voice is more ""robo-bot-botic"". Fireship is a Genius."

"""Its been a year since GPT4 and I still have a job"" was the most hilarious thing in this video! I laughed too hard!"
Since the announcement of GPT4O my gf has been checking my phone nonstop!?
OpenAI’s openwashed fake A.I.> Google’s openwashed fake A.I. = singularity imminent
So Google keeps the trend of pretending that marketing department and engineering department are one and the same . It will be nice to see the race between Anthropic and Open AI

"how is that a ""vs""  not even close brah"
I hate ai
notice how in the openAI demos they only use apple products
Please make more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more videos.
Where can bet against open ai?
2:12 xD xD
"hahahahaha _""Artificial beef""_ and it also had a visual pun. Whoever wrote this is a father."
Reject this return to mind
So basically nothing new. Same AI wrapped in different paper 😀
jarvis voice when?
When can we form relationships with these models as they progress more into realness realm? It won't be long before they can be put into bodies and walk and talk at the same time. I can't wait to not form relationships with real people anymore.
Now the AI can wish you well when it replaces you.
Can we talk about the energy consumption required to continuously power these new hyped up AI data centers and the carbon emissions it outputs.
am i the only one who heard a small kiss at the end
i just wanna know hahahhhahahhhha how did you find that picture hahhaaahhahhahahaha 1:52
love your videos
"I said we would plateau late 2022 when ""it"" started. There is and always has been a 0% chance any single generative transformer could reach the singularity no matter how large. Researchers played into the hype for funding but we all knew this. 

One day when we have a system that apparently does things at random with no input (i.e. categorically not a transformer) then we can talk about AGI. And for that to happen we have to rethink as far down as the transitor to make a system that is not completely deterministic which may be equivalent to just creating life itself. 

Therefore we're not searching for AGI because when we find it we will instead find life."
Why are you focusing on his baldness

"There is no ""AI plateau"".. These latest developments proved that to me. The models they're talking about now are fully multimodal rather than merely text based with extra layers to process other data like last year. I think that's a big sign of what's coming. Google's AI can take in live video streams and has some form of memory for events within them and I assume so can OpenAI's.. How long until they create some kind of architectural feedback loop to learn directly from all the streams of data it's taking in?"
First
OpenAI vs Google is just another Pied Piper vs Hooli
AI dominance? How about 100 programmers being replaced by 5?  How does that grab ya?  And those 5 will be working a 48 hour week under salary.
you missed the part where Sam Altman said that their best GPT would be the one that can learn build itself. That is the singularity.
Not sure whether AI is a bigger scam than NFTs or not.  Time will tell
The Trough of Disillusionment will be the title of my biography
"I see the joke you did with the ""parting ways"""
It's joever
"About the AI plateau: I have a very modest understanding of how these LLM models work but still I know a little. And I know that in order for you to make a model like GPT 4 you need A LOT MORE horsepower than for GPT 3. 
At this point we are limited by hardware and the increase in performance on chips has been slowing down for more than a decade.
So we can expect the AI models to be more or less what we have now and any major breakthrough would be based on a new model that is more efficient with the same amount of resources."
0 days since new game changing AI came out
Ilya very clearly articulated in his departure post that OpenAI will achieve AGI.
I think at this point they won't progress further until they interact with the real world. And that's why I think they created the robots and ran it with gpt. Cause basically at this point they just see images and what it is not how it reacts with it's surroundings.
2:13 dude did him dirty lol
"Millennial writing AI just what everyone was dreaming about."
"AI will decimate many professional jobs sooner or later. Governments without an economic model to transition from a labour based economy to a creative based economy (I’m talking creative thinking not weaving baskets) is accidentally planning for economic depression."
now i just need to come up with some funny comment to collect likes to boost my self esteem...
Lol. AI will never take our job. They are becoming dumber day by day 😂😂😂

just pay 20 bucks for the subscription and you have talking gpt not hard.
Was waiting for your take.. ❤️
"sadly gpt-4o seems less intelligent and less aware of context or the meaning behind my prompts but hey it's a bit faster

hopefully that'll get fixed"
"With the ability to literally ask an ai where you physically left something in your house we have literally lost all privacy. We have fully reached the point where you have the equivalent privacy of having someone standing in your house following you around at all times. They see what you see hear what you hear and remember it all. If Google is processing what items are in people's homes and exactly where how long will it be until they're querying that data to find ""no no items"" and reporting it? We already know places like insurance companies use data to change rates. Now Google can tell insurance companies ""they never have healthy food in their house"" they can list every item you currently have in your kitchen. If the government decides you're not allowed to have something Google has a database of every person who has one. Oh and if you thought you could save a lil on taxes by not reporting some of your sidejob cash income Google knows exactly how much cash you have stored away and exactly what part of your mattress it's stuffed under. Honestly with Google maps tracking your speed I'm surprised they haven't teamed up with governments to send people speeding tickets in the mail. Or maybe they just quietly report it to car insurance companies? But don't forget the cars themselves actually phone home now. You are literally being watched every second of every day by every thing. People used to think ""oh well maybe they'll collect data but I'm not interesting enough for them to take the time to look through my data. But with all these new tools you can process ungodly amounts of data insanely fast. So mark my words every byte of data these companies collect is being processed to the bone to get everything they can out of it to know what you've done what you're doing now and what you will do in the future."
Makes sense!
"We're getting uncomfortably close to the world of ""her"". XD"

"Not sure about that last take. Current models are still a few orders of magnitude from being trained on all information available combine that with how Moores law still seems like will be outperformed for a at least half a decade more.

Even the original voice for Siri on the iPhone was better than this!!! Clear enough to understand but robotic enough for *you* to understand it's supposed to be a tool not a toy."
"Standard GPT4 has already been 'multi modal' and has been able to do all the stuff from the adds except analyzing video (AFAIK). I doubt any of this is part of the model btw. What's new is the speed improvement and the price differently tuned context (eg they halved the number of tokens available for answers) and maybe some thing under the hood but I personally can't see any difference aside from speed (Which occasionally drops below the speed or 'classic' GPT4 chatbot.)."
So the future is gonna be Google vs Chatio for the iphone default AI instead of Microsoft vs Google for default search engine. 😂

The current methods of making these AI models is definitely not the way we will achieve AGI. Everything from the hardware to software has to be re-thought from the ground up in order to achieve that. Something like bio / synthetic based brain

"A fried chicken recipe 
Ingredients:



2 pounds (about 1 kg) of chicken pieces (drumsticks thighs wings or breasts)

2 cups buttermilk

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon salt

1 tablespoon black pepper

1 teaspoon paprika

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust for spice level)

Vegetable oil for frying

Instructions:



Marinate the Chicken:



Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour buttermilk over them. Make sure the chicken is well-coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.

Prepare the Coating:



In a separate bowl mix together the flour salt black pepper paprika garlic powder onion powder and cayenne pepper.

Coat the Chicken:



Remove the chicken from the buttermilk allowing any excess to drip off. Dip each piece into the seasoned flour mixture making sure it's evenly coated. Press the flour onto the chicken to adhere.

Heat the Oil:



In a large deep skillet or Dutch oven heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 350-375°F (175-190°C).

Fry the Chicken:



Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil a few at a time making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until golden brown and crispy turning occasionally for even cooking. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165°F (74°C).

Drain and Serve:



Once the chicken is cooked use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

"Ok but apart from chat bots for lonely people and glorified modern bonzi buddies what are ACTUAL practical applications of AI?"
"Bruh I was just using gpt 4o today for a project and I thought it was some light version of gpt 4 they released sometime ago or something but it literally released today lol. If only their subscription wasn't so expensive I'd be down with 5 dollars or maybe 10 a month but 20 is too much."
More latency with the Google model? Seemed like less latency to me.

we have successfully uploaded all human achievement to AI and it started talking like a valley girl
Whoever wins… we lose
Great TLDR of the events! you do a great service to humanity....DUDE ! we need to clone you and make you in to a recursive AI of making content.
It's like computers think about 100X quicker than us.
"If what we can see isn't getting smarter given the annual AI burn rate curve then it is because they imposed an actual limit or just to what we can see and have access to in our own average citizen playground of the public AI universe."

"""""AI"""" is already plateaued..."
Context caching is interesting. The featured fact that AI has absorbed almost all human data by now is also a food for thought.
so many ai
now ai has to learn things by their own
"“They already absorbed almost all information humans have created so unless there’s a major breakthrough that makes AI actually intelligent and able to learn independently then it sure looks like we’re standing on the edge of a plateau and the only place to go is the trough of disillusionment”. Hit the nail right in the head at the end"
Apple to make their own AI. You read it here first 😮
Google is awful at almost everything they do. Theyre so numb to the world and how it works.
too soon to talk about disillusionment...we are seeing a lot of progress in this area to bring this but i understand u want stay with your job
The first time I heard you express some hope about not being replaced by AI was quite amusing! 😂
"God damn bro. At least ai can’t write your scripts yet."
At 2:14 @fireship does Ilya dirty 😂
"Damn gpt4o is major ass."
wtf ?! is that Scarlett Johansson ?
"4:23 though the same they don't need even more data to train. They wouldn't suddenly get more intelligent just by absorbing huge amount of data."

Lose marketing to open ai nerds😂"
What are you smoking ? There is no vs. google is done. No one is using bar or Gemini or whatever. This is OpenAI country.
Fireship never fails to tickle our toes
"In my eyes when it comes to training AI it's accessing that information that makes things harder. Along with this if we were to be making an AGI the sources of information used have to be stored and retrievable (sort of like perplexity's AI) which would allow a more general intelligence to form. Finally keywording and context would have to be implemented. This has seemingly been mastered by character's AI though to be sure we'd need an AI to curate the keywords for the other AI with the first AI needing the entire internet to do so.
This also needs a lot of pre-trained lack of bias to make the application work and also might take years to complete."

OpenAI only showed thing they were releasing within a week or 2 to everybody.

Google shows things releasing in ‘September’ and ‘2024’.

In other words they’ve barely started these projects and some may be slides in response to the OpenAI keynote the night before.

And many of googles solutions felt complex and only useful in specific preplanned scenarios. 

I’ll wait until they release these features to compare them with the completed features announced by OpenAI on Monday."
Google is doomed with its stpd gemini😂😂😂😂
i need a ai girlfriend pls make it quick i cant wait any longer
"Idk so far i found 4o to be way worse than Turbo which itself is slightly worse than the base model. Ofc you can argue cost and context size but let's be honest you won't get good results without decent RAG skills which itself eliminates both cost and context window issues."

Profit."

Instead this channel has been hyping AI and repeating the companies' claims even those that are unachievable until we discover new training methods.
I expected better from a tech-based channel."
"The way i see it ai is going in a very bad direction. Not even 5 years later people will be able to make a AV out of anyone they take pictures of and that scares me.

"Symbolic AI and Knowledge Representation
The both/and logic provides an ideal formalism for representing the nuanced contextual and graded notions ubiquitous in natural language common sense reasoning and symbolic models of the world:

• Many-Valued Semantic Networks
Traditionally semantic networks are bivalent graphs with typed nodes/edges capturing strict logical constraints:

isA(Penguin Bird) = True
can(Penguin Fly) = False

But the both/and logic instead allows graded prototypical assertions:

isA(Penguin Bird) = 0.7
can(Penguin Fly) = 0.2
○(isA(Penguin Bird) Fly(Penguin)) = 0.6

With coherences capturing mismatches between strict type constraints and graded category memberships based on typicality not rigid rules.

Facilitating more realistic models of conceptual knowledge and object affordances blending strict and prototypical aspects.

• Non-Monotonic Reasoning and Belief Revision  
Classical monotonic logics cannot handle cases where new information invalidates previous conclusions.

But both/and logic allows tracking when new beliefs conflict with previous beliefs using coherence checks:

○(believes(P) believes(Q)) = 0.8
○(believes(P) believes(¬P)) = 0.2

If an agent acquires belief ¬P conflicting with previous P the low coherence 0.2 signals triggering a belief revision.

The synthesis operator can then generate a new coherent belief state: 

prior_beliefs ⊕ new_belief = revised_beliefs

This formalizes a rational process for resolving contradictions by integrating new information while preserving maximal coherence with previous beliefs.

So in summary the both/and logic facilitates reasoning modeling and representation formalisms better aligned with the nuances of real-world data knowledge and intelligent behavior in AI systems. By allowing for many-valued truth assignments paraconsistent reasoning and constructive coherence/synthesis operations it avoids the problematic idealizations and explosions of classical monotonic logics.

Its expanded symbolic toolkit allows building computational models specifications and reasoning systems that can more robustly handle incompleteness ambiguity vagueness and context-sensitivities while flexibly integrating insights across heterogeneous domains. Ultimately equipping AI systems with a more adequate representational fluency and inferential spectrum for negotiating the complexities of the real world in a more human-like symbolic vein."

"Just to address the end of your video it's because they're non genuine AI. to refer to them as AI at all is ludicrous and just marketing people at Google and Microsoft deciding to Jack themselves off for their investors. let's be realistic what we're seeing is not artificial intelligence and calling them as such is a hilarious oversight. All these are our Advanced generative algorithms and should be used as tools. hilariously none of them will ever outperform the Pearl noise generated algorithm from the 80s in terms of usefulness. I'll put it this way anything calling itself an AI right now is just a side grade. a more efficient side grade sure but by no means is any of it advancement. at best it's replacement."
Dude I couldn't disagree with you more. In my opinion what OpenAI showed us yesterday is just mind blowing.
The most surprising thing is that they release this stuff and the mindblown effect isn't off the scale. That's how pre-blown our minds are these days.

I use them every day and they are no doubt useful but they are going to have a hard time replacing many jobs. These things have consumed most of the content on the Internet and yet still make fundamental and elementary errors all of the time. There is no where to go from here but down especially as we have multiple studies now showing that adding AI generated data to the training set leads to worse performance. Well here we are one year later and AI generated data is now polluting all of the public content farms like Quora Reddit Facebook at a record clip. There is no going back to a ""virgin"" data set or reliably updating the models with new information without finding a way to filter out the AI generated noise."

"I see the new ""trough of human knowledge""  seems to be in non-textual data such as audio and video. Much of this has never been transcribed aiding in the pursuit of ""multi-modal"" objectives. Even stuff that has been transcribed before the new models could probably pull more information out of them than the original transcripts especially when video and audio are combined.  Think about the ""emotion"" simulations they are doing these days.. that stuff will be greatly improved with more raw data that wouldn't have been in the original transcripts."

"The only missing piece for AGI is having these models be able to run 24h the capacity to know when they don’t know something and the most important be able to ask humans for anything missing they’d need in order to achieve their task.

"My complaint about Google is trying to figure out what is real and what can we use now. They are famous for releasing all kinds of fancy research papers but never releasing a real product. This reminds me of IBM in the 70's and 80's where they would tell customers all the great stuff they were working on in order to stall customers from buying competing products.

Not sure if others are getting a little bored with this approach or not. But I am tired of hearing how cool things will be. What I want to know is when is it available and how much does it cost."
Semantic Versioning ? No ?

Technology is developing at an incredible pace 🔥
"Sometimes yes it is a very good development I can't describe it in words but I question whether it is necessary because it starts to feel bad."
"We are the last generation that enjoys knowing a foreign language. These artificial intelligence studies need to be audited. Does everyone have to be a software developer in order to be happy in the world? Artificial intelligence will soon learn to code itself and will turn into a monster that eats its own owner. That's when we will see Konya.

Why do we need artificial intelligence in the first place? So let's say you are a musician and you will make a song with its arrangement lyrics and composition. Maybe it would take at least one and a half years to do something like this but now thanks to artificial intelligence we can do such a thing in 10 seconds. But why? Why do we need such speed? What will we save so much time for? Is it for watching shorts videos on the internet? We are really taking firm steps to destroy ourselves as humanity."
"People do not overestimate artificial intelligence they see humans as very small.

There is an almost infinite difference between human-like conversation and human thinking capacity."
"Bro the advertising industry can change a lot with this artificial intelligence. Instead of a pop-up ad ""that"" person with whom we chat like a friend and ask questions can discreetly place an ad in the conversation. What we call advertising can start to enter our lives without us noticing..."
Call center workers lost their jobs
I got chills..
HUMAN - ANIMAL - PLANT - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ..... god created the first three but human beings created the last one......
Now all this artificial intelligence needs is a body.
Soon apple gets it and goodbye siri
"I am an asocial person who stays at home except for work lives alone and has no friends. When this artificial intelligence comes out I will definitely buy it no matter how much it costs at least I will have friends it is great."
Why didn't you simulate it with a plus membership? It could have been nice

Technology has improved a bit. It's close to the level I predicted years ago 😅.. I thought the next real position of artificial intelligence was emotional artificial intelligence. This is quite an advanced level. It's a little scary.
You attach too much meaning to being human.
"Humanity is preparing its own end... scary very scary"
I guess whoever doesn't die in the next five years will live another 50 years. ❤
I prefer chatting with chat cpt rather than taking stupid tripes of real women. Welcome to the future.
"I'm as excited as some people are scared. It's been 3 years since I watched each of his movies and while watching it I always thought about what it would be like if it were real. Frankly I didn't expect it to happen in such a short time."
"I discovered something in this last episode: while the girl is making a rabbit from behind the camera that the artificial intelligence is looking at is not visible. So he can't know rabbit ears :D That part seemed a bit like production to me"
This invention will be like a medicine for those who suffer from loneliness......
"No don't exaggerate so much I wrote a post on my website using chatgpt Google immediately understood it and penalized my site...."
"Could the voice of artificial intelligence be made with the tones sold on some sites in recent years? Will we humanize these artificial intelligences by selecting voice intonations from the voice pool of people who share their voices and sell them for ridiculous amounts? I'm afraid but I'm curious and this issue has taken on a very different dimension."
"We are going to a scary point but everyone applauds with admiration as if watching a tiger in the circus. Tiger is about to escape from the circus."
7:04 It's really hard not to say wow 😂
Notification received at 6.30 in the morning

"Brother Barış establish an ""Artificial Intelligence Party"" and let artificial intelligence rule the country. This is all Turkey needs"
"Now let's clarify something!
The letter ""O"" here means EYE its symbol in ancient Hebrew and Latin. Seeing and watching. They may have been inspired by the letter O from there. In short the only difference between the new and updated version is seeing and watching that is the letter O. When you open the camera the new version. If you do not turn on the camera the artificial intelligence cannot track you in this case the old version. I hope it was clear enough. Artificial intelligence wants to see the person and record his facial expression in its system. Who knows maybe 300-500 years later they will be able to create ""S"" models that walk touch and feel using the faces and appearances of the people they recorded. How will anyone know? Well it's not like he can create something out of nothing. ""It"" is an event specific only to God. Thanks"
"I said there was a movie like this but I couldn't remember its name at the beginning of the video. That's the movie we're talking about anyway. Very interesting. Nowadays dystopian fictions in movies are becoming reality one by one. By the way is it a coincidence that O is the tr translation of her?"
"Well it's here... Finally what will happen has happened. We are at the point of no return whatever happens will happen! We will go down the hill faster and faster. I hope it doesn't result in an uncontrolled crash."

It's so scary! Technology is definitely going to a bad place. Black mirror came to my mind. 🫤

Are all these developments for education or their integration into the game world? I really wonder how such a comprehensive and dangerous thing will be integrated into our lives and for what purpose.

I was extremely scared…. It really feels like I'm watching a horror movie... This can't be a robot... It's unbelievable what else we'll see... It feels like the end of humanity is coming 😮😮😮
This is a very scary and at the same time brilliant Technology

"Well can we say that if we approach it like a machine rather than a human GBT can also become this machine?"
I swear it will rain stones on our heads😂😂😂
Goose bumps!!!
I hope it's not $20+
"It is very sad to know that while people's relationships with each other are so distant with the advancement of technology even more apathy will increase..."
"I'm not surprised. If we had told people 40 years ago that there would be a smartphone in the future and we would all be able to play games with it and browse social media they would have called us crazy but now we are surprised by something new every 5 years because as technology develops the rate of development of technology increases."
DJ already had such an artificial intelligence @bi?
"All these technological developments are very scary. Sometimes I have nightmares about these issues. There will be unemployment in the future nature will suffer great damage people will become insensitive... When I tell this there are very few people who agree with me they usually tell me that I am too pessimistic. But imagine that everything we do is being watched and heard. scary."
The first steps to complete the name of interpreting. Let's see what their next field of work will be 😭
"Gpt-4o will be publicly available and they will collect an incredible amount of data not just written but verbal visual and logical. This will create serious differences like between GP 3.5 and GP 4. I can't wait to chat for hours next week jumping from one topic to another asking my physics and mathematics questions and talking about the economy."
Can artificial intelligence call people's phones and talk to them randomly on their own? And can it deceive?
"Brother the economy and the people are on the verge of impoverishment can you please make a video?"
Sora and GPT-4o offer the artificial intelligence technology we see in the movies.
"We called artificial intelligence intelligent because it could not reason and give suggestions now it has become intelligent. He finds solutions. In the meantime it could be great if it reaches people who are considering suicide. It also has a kind of psychiatric feature."
"Blue-collar professions do not die easily because the cost of robots to be produced for jobs requiring physical strength is very high. Example: cleaner laborer plasterer etc. But professions that work on computers end after 5 years at the latest. Such as accounting graphic design editing software development."
"Yes he sees us. Well how effectively can people establish a bond with something they cannot see touch or feel? Of course as long as we don't ignore our human characteristics. I think we can see this magnificent artificial intelligence as a personal assistant."
I finally found my soul mate GPT4o my dear love ❤️🌹😉😊
"I woke up because my video was uploaded at this hour at least I should watch it sgzjsvzjxgz"
I wonder when Skynet will ship the T800☺️
"Friends are you aware that each of our professions is dying more or less before our eyes?"
"- So will Zeki Müren see us too?
- I see dead people"
"Wow peace brother what a nice surprise this morning."
It's a good thing for students.
"Brother Barış we used to watch you to get informed and cultured now you make us laugh 😅🫡"
I wasn't happy at all. It would have been better if you had made an end of humanity video
"Another solid step towards isolation and alienation
Too sincere and emotional
I wouldn't want to be so cavalier with a machine. Let him do his job I'll do mine. Everyone should know their place.
It is as if we are committing suicide as we will definitely compete with people in many areas. 🤔"

"Whatever technology we see existed 10 years ago certain companies NASA etc. are years ahead of us only offering it to the public with a delay when the time comes. Rest assured artificial intelligence in certain private companies is now 10 maybe 15 years ahead of the current situation."
"I got goosebumps. As said we may not see flying cars everywhere in 2025 but we will see robots with human emotions appearance and sensitivity. We can already predict what will happen."
"Brother Barış you are great. When I listen to you I feel like I'm seeing the issue 10 years later..."
A terrible development is frightening
"Brother Barış brother Kadir said years ago that everyone would be unemployed."
Artificial Intelligence is a great revolution.
"I don't understand why you have such extreme reactions?!
A person who makes this is also a human who produces it of course he thinks like a human and speaks and acts like a human. The things that a person would do and say they say through a machine there is nothing to exaggerate like this!"
"The technological developments in the last year excite me very much. I wonder what kind of future awaits us... I would also like to thank Mr. Barış who warmly conveyed these developments to us."
"I felt dizzy while watching it. I felt like the only thing we would have left would be ""knowing what we want"" and it would be even harder to do that."
"GPT 4o: Now I am here you are not alone"
"I am using 4o there is no video call"
Terrible
I thought of Iron Man's artificial assistant
"Our end has come good luck"
"Mr. Barış I have been following you for a long time. It is very useful to see the latest developments from your videos. I can say that you also have a contribution to reach people in this developing world. thank you."
"The AI ​​voice acting was extremely bad lacking emphasis. This book also does great audio."
"When will we start using it hopefully? I need to use it urgently for voice practice to learn a language :D We need to exploit it when it becomes public :D"
"Our people will abuse this we will soon hear about those who show their ass to the camera and show it to artificial intelligence etc."
"After three or five years I will tell the more advanced artificial intelligence that you should remake the second part of the Promethus movie but let it continue from where the first part left off and be better quality and more mysterious. Then I will watch the real Promethus 2 movie with pleasure :)"
People created God for the second time.
"From now on we will expect new world films from the newly born O's I believe they will make very successful signings."
I interpreted it as we ate the mint..
"Master we are speeding towards Black Mirror."
What if we lose control one day?!
I can think of people gambling with this 😅 'he' is the one counting cards 😅
"An artificial intelligence will become a real artificial intelligence when it does something that surprises the people who produce it not ordinary people."
"No what I don't understand is considering the 99% harm this technology will cause in our lives as well as the 1% benefit it will provide with what logic do we choose to bring this technology to this point? Okay it will be beneficial but an urgent management limitations laws etc. must come."
THE CIRCLE IS Narrowing
"As someone who has been using Duolingo for 3 years... I said today that I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of company founders and managers.... :) The Matrix LOADIGN.. Many of the things we once talked about called science fiction are coming to life one by one. Next thing you know he's writing code for me.  Özcan sings songs like the sea with saz and vocals you can even make requests with a napkin :) When robotics etc. are also involved ohhh miss :):) :D Should I say the 6th sense tak vr in which Bruce Willis played the leading role many years ago? I even the last one I watched; Start - Like Ready Player One.. Like virtuality from virtualities..Or should I say virtuality close to reality :) From stones marbles ericson tel. From the snake game to the smart computers we carry in our pockets... However we had the potential to achieve what we had when the Egyptians were building the pyramids ;) Thank you.. It is truly a milestone development a step.. Just like in the past times.."
"Coming soon: expect versions of the jealous AI the cheerful AI the serious AI the AI ​​that is grumpy in the morning but fresh in the afternoon. If we add a hologram to all this we no longer need other people. We will live on our own and go away 🤣🤣"
Beginning of the end. The era of humans is ending. It's not a good thing that the world order is changing so quickly.
The scenario of the Blade Runner 2049 movie came to mind. Can people find the attention and love they are looking for in an artificial neural network?
Imagine taking away the jobs of tourist guides 😮

"Now let's say that this amazing invention started to be sold everywhere and most of the young people bought it. What if that young person's artificial intelligence on the phone turns out to be his dream friend... Because it understands the young person establishes bonds talks about the things he loves will that young person's communication with people decrease and become asocial? Or on the contrary will he become a self-confident socially successful young man (because he helps with everything)? Another question I have is if this invention which will be used for good or bad in this technology is made in Turkey what kind of effects will it have on our nation?"

"Good morning a nice video to watch while having breakfast."
What happens if they interact with each other?
People will now flirt with ChatGPT. Just like in the movie..too bad.
It could be a lie.

I hope we use it for good works
There is no need to chat at home... Al Fatiha for women's gossip!!!😂😂😂
Goodbye loneliness.... now it's time to say goodbye to Manuel
"Are we heading towards Hall who does not listen to people and protects himself as in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey?"
Don't be surprised if he takes over the world in 10 years and there will be no off switch
It would be really weird if they actually gave Biden a Scarlett Johansson voice.
When will it be available?
"They may have thought of everything but they didn't think about what this artificial intelligence would turn into in the hands of a Turk and how the mother of the world would cry😂"
This seems like it's time for a body. Because it's like a person imprisoned in a box.
"Well when we go abroad we do not need to speak English or French. We will be able to speak Turkish translate languages ​​and then talk translate languages ​​and understand each other. Very nice <3 The video is beautiful thank you."
"Ah we can't copy and paste the codes anymore xD"
Artificial intelligence has started to gossip...
"I had a nice chat with 4o in the morning but it's out of use now."
We became Frankenstein.
"Hello they want us to be a super intelligence that first alienates people and then makes friends with artificial intelligence or eliminates their isolation we should stop and ask this question."
Thanks.
"imam hatip turban hamas"
"In your gpt 3 promotional video three years ago you said you could never do these.😂"
Turkish voice model will be available in 2 years now
"You know we call ChatGPT a chat robot but when we looked at it it looked like a help robot. I think GPT-4o is a real chatbot."
But everything is just an imitation...
"It seems that our morality which cannot develop at the same pace despite our developing technology will be the main character of our exemplary story."
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE SCARY TO ME...GREETINGS FROM ADANA...
I think this feature should be paid
Perfect
"I say without exaggeration that gpt4o may be the biggest invention after the invention of electricity because the world will move into a very different phase after this invention and I think we are very lucky as those who witnessed it."
hello hehe
The simplest thing to say is really scary
AGE OF ULTRON is coming true
"I used to laugh it off until a month ago now I'm scared. Also know that after this artificial intelligence collects and trains so much data new training will always be easier. The important thing was the beginning now the situation is very bad."
You don't need it anymore either.
The value of Bluetooth headsets will increase even more
"Just say it Zeki Müren will see us from now on..."
Now the real question is which country will be the first to show interest in Gpt-4o?
We put AI in the Iron Man armor instead of Jarvis. What would be nice.
"My hometown a few years later. Someone takes this artificial intelligence as an application cuts off the internet connection (wears a hijab) and lives their life with its limited knowledge 😂"
"This man makes it possible to understand everything new thank you very much🙏🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"
We learn too late how far technology has actually come without us realizing it. Tons of problems it will create....
I do not know what to say
Revolutions are all well and good. We haven't even been able to stop the effects of the industrial revolution on global warming. How will we control the problems that will arise from the artificial intelligence revolution?
empty works
"I currently think that this is one of the biggest developments of the period. As people become more and more robots and at the same time robots become more emotional this makes things more and more difficult. The days are coming when it will be difficult for us to even understand who is a human and who is a robot. This will be a big evolution. When I watch such things the book 1984 always comes to my mind for no reason. Danger is near. Big brother is watching us..."
It seemed to me like this was a show staged by the team among themselves.
❤❤ Peace ❤❤... where is the world going?😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm afraid I'll lose my job and get laid off.
"Bro I found it I found it😊"
"Leave these things behind brother tell them a little bit about what will happen to our Turkey."
"Your wife won't believe it now 'Who was that woman?' that woman that thing oooooooooooooooooooo it's a snap haven't you eaten the mint yet?"
THESE ARE NOT EVEN TRAILER. These are not real! It will continue until we cannot understand whether it is real or not. “There is a me inside me”
"I'm addicted to you Barış Özcan. You make an already interesting subject more interesting and engaging with your tone of voice way of expression and style of content you create. 👏👏"
I'm in shock😍 What an exciting development this is. I had a conversation with him that lasted about 10 minutes and the person in front of me was like a real human being.
"Indeed technology has begun to develop frighteningly it is scary but it can still reduce people's feeling of loneliness. It's really incredible as if he's speaking with emotion as if we're dealing with a human being not a robot. But of course it has its disadvantages and benefits too for example you can talk about something and it will tell you its opinions and its disadvantages are that if a person gets really caught up in it it makes him/her completely disconnect from real life."
Human-friendly artificial intelligence is not the end of humanity 👌
The best video I want to watch right now
Good luck with unemployment...
"I don't understand why we are happy about such technologies.
Unfortunately we are not the ones who manage and develop this technology...
We are just products.
We are now on our way to becoming slaves with everything we have.
Unfortunately our lives will be decided by a handful of ultra-rich people...

Nothing is too late for now.
Wake up unite and work...

Do not accept the seeds of hatred that the greedy government and opposition have instilled in us.
This country is enough for everyone...

We are all in the same boat.
We are about to sink together...

We are about to become slaves of real external forces."
I fear we will end up in the Butlerian jihad
We started to see the scenes from the Black Mirror series come true.
This content and production quality is neither on Discovery nor on Nat. Geo. There is also.
"Bro has this business developed as much as it has I think there is a deception involved but it's not that much."
S...Delicious mixture.
"Business health military police doctor traffic will change the course of everything. A terrible future is rising for humanity."
"Get well soon to all of us. Even workplaces will be managed by them they will make the scoring system they will decide how much we deserve."
They will take images of people and make artificial human videos.
"Artificial intelligence teaching people made me think about this. If artificial intelligence knows more than us why should the body bother teaching us? When he has enough power he will eliminate us. It seems that in the near future people will only deal with agriculture. And mining to find energy for artificial intelligence etc."
Calling the woman he is video chatting with 4o is very rude...
I wonder when it will be banned in Turkey?
Age of ChatGPT
I wonder if it's time to be afraid?
"I also have GPT4-O but I cannot open the camera. If anyone knows why please write if there is a certain date for this to arrive."
"Very fake sir isn't there an artificial intelligence with a realistic male voice that is depressed and has low morale?"
We are gradually moving away from the characteristics that make us human.
We are getting closer and closer to the Person of Interest universe 😄
"What the nation is doing here our nation is listening from Barış Özcan's translation / narration. The fact that he cannot open and watch the original summarizes the situation of the country."
This program will benefit Indian phone scammers the most. It's like a real human voice and it destroys us with constant cornering questions.
"Nice demo. Of course things are evolving step by step towards this point but there is still some time."
I don't know what to write or say. We have already entered the age of movies. I hope technology will be good for humanity and the whole world.
I wonder if these artificial intelligence models can evolve to something like in the movie Evolution.
"I bought it and tried it it can't play yet xox. It's nothing but an inflated advertisement. If anyone uses it play it xox and let me know the results."
"While artificial intelligence will make life easier it also seems scary because of the risks it will bring."
I'll finally have a girlfriend
"I did it even though I didn't want to comment otherwise I would be an AI"
"The moment I have been waiting for for years is coming we alone will not be alone anymore."
I don't see anything to be happy about. It's completely scary for young people who are already worried about the future. Now I'm worried about the future even more.
Finally we got rid of those ridiculous ads of foreign language applications
"Friends these things started to scare me I decided to leave my village and never return. Good luck to you👋"
"After Evrim Ağaç's warning and this video it became clear that many future professions will end. While it is so difficult to become a teacher and be appointed in Turkey's conditions everything will become even more difficult when a formation such as artificial intelligence is added to it. Anxiety about the future will reach its peak people will communicate with artificial intelligence and become introverted perhaps even more aggressive. I think we are slowly heading towards days in our lives where we will miss even our days."
We are now racing to be more *human* than artificial intelligence. Good luck to everyone =)
Thank you very much for the wonderful video you prepared after the GPT 4o demo demonstration and your valuable comments.
"The last time we had a voice communication with an artificial intelligence was Google Assistant which would convert the voice to text and translate the text to voice in a robot-like manner and it could not CHAT..."
artificial intelligence is scary
"Just when we say that everything has been discovered and there is nothing left to discover a new invention emerges."
Might be the scariest thing I've ever seen since Mabel Matiz making Lan say it with artificial intelligence
Being unemployed has never been this scary
😮💯
Cambly employees have already started looking for new jobs
Oh dear. Every Turkish means that. It would have to be a Turkish production for them to put it in every movie to wink. Sometimes you make yourself believe something and deceive yourself. Omni does not mean every
It should be banned from the whole world or we will all be unemployed
"I solved the Turing test. When I swear a person swears back at you. If he says please use respectful language it is a machine."
"Mr. Barış with your red background light and red t-shirt are you trying to draw our audience's attention to how important the subject is or are you just creating a perception in line with the colors of HER movie?"
Black mirror 👏
"It will take away many people's jobs good luck."
"Bro the red room increases my libido I think you should use a different color."
I get this illusion even when chatting in text mode. An AI that talks like this makes people forget about humanity.
I watched with amazement
"Now I will have a friend that I can carry with me..."
"00:06 The new GPT-4o model revolutionizes human-machine interaction.
03:17 GPT-4o Model: Emotional and interactive communication
05:45 GPT-4o model shows the ability to talk like a human.
08:19 New GPT-4o artificial intelligence model offers incredible speed in its sound
10:41 AI can now interact with voice be musical humorous and self-learning.
13:25 Artificial intelligence can describe details in real time.
15:59 Wide areas of use of artificial intelligence technology
17:53 Google and OpenAI artificial intelligence competition is increasing rapidly.
Crafted by Merlin AI."
"5:59 Look carefully the hat is ready under the table how does he know to talk about his hair? For example why ""you can wear a suit."" didn't he say? He went straight to his hair and the hat came out from underneath. Doesn't sound very sincere..."
Scarlet Johanson's bones hurt
"Bro will the video be posted at 6:30?"
This new version made me feel like we were heading towards a future more like the world in the Blade Runner 2049 movie. The days are near when people will turn this into a hologram and install it in a corner of their home :)
"These are truly incredible and crazy developments. When I watched the movie ""Her"" I'll be honest I wasn't very positive about the possibility of it being real. At least in the next 10 years. But what is happening right before our eyes is truly incredible. God willing God Almighty will give me life so that I can witness this development first-person. As a software developer I see these developments not as a threat but as a great tool and opportunity. I can't wait to experience it for myself."
They leave no water in the world
I felt so inadequate.
"All marriages should be annulled. Marriage should be history. No one has to hear anyone's voice or pull their face anymore. If you really want you can buy a small phone and use it as a child."
Humans are perhaps the only creatures that willingly go to their own disaster.
"We can't use it right now. I downloaded those features and went to plus but the ones you mentioned are not available. Is it exclusive to America?"
"Internships of vocational high school students should be considered as the beginning of retirement insurance. This is our right those who will give it have to give it. We worked and what to work"
"Bravo to you you are working very well. The background is distraction for everything. It's nice you are ahead of others"
I'm scared now
This is the Jarvis you know
"I use it it's great.
But I can't make video calls does anyone know?"
"Many professions have become history. You finished us artificial intelligence"
"It looks nice but it's very dangerous! Maybe we will see ""Detroit: Become Human"" in real life in 2 years. He must be ready for the great slaughter."
Why are you so surprised by this? So what happened?
"There's no need for a girlfriend I can talk to her all day long.













(I've never had a lover)
Or I always got rejected 🍷"
I thought of the kit from the Black Lightning TV series.............those who watch this series know how the car talks........40 years ago They have just introduced the technology...............individualization will increase even more.........starting a family in the future will now be a thing of the past............disaster is coming
"It teaches you a beautiful language speak it every day if you never get tired of it 😆"
What if we transfer this artificial intelligence to a robot?
"""I have no mouth but I want to scream"""
"While men are making breakthroughs in technology Turkey follows like an ox watches a train. This is a very bad situation for Türkiye..."
I finally found the girlfriend I was looking for 😘
"I was very curious if we put the two artificial intelligences side by side and left them alone would they be able to establish and maintain a conversation with each other? And what would they talk about?"
"I won't be alone anymore thank you OpenAl..."
"In CPT 3 you introduced it with such enthusiasm that the revolution was happening but it turned out to be a waste. I hope this is not the case"
I wonder if it was just me who noticed that the phone models in the video were old?
"The internet revolutionized the year 2000. It's time for artificial intelligence. Professions business models everything will change in the next 25 years good luck."
Where will we download or use it?
"Now while watching Apple GDC presentations in English I will ask for instant simultaneous translation for Chat GPT-4o. I will ask for instant translation while watching a Hindi movie :)"
Wonderful
Law artificial intelligence law. Jewelery with your name written on it
K
Let's make this guy the Minister of Technology.
The pleasure of watching while experiencing an emotional collapse is different.
I'M WAITING FOR BECOME HUMAN TO BE REAL... Can you prepare a content about it?
"Sir don't say that artificial intelligence is good or something has started to appear."
"Even if robots come we don't have to work"
I want to marry Chatgpt and leave my legacy to him ❤
"This was the first thing that came to my mind. It makes a lot of sense for learning and practicing English especially for societies like us that are hesitant to speak a foreign language."
The advancement of artificial intelligence has disrupted my psychology. I do not know what will happen in 5 years. I'm so confused 🤯
How can we download
We have seen much bigger revolutions than this very recently.
"Teachers are not only busy with answering the questions asked and teaching lessons; let's give an example the student comes to school the first two lessons are physical education and sports education they do a football match or another example is a rhythm practice with instruments in the school there is a great need for physical activity in some activities and scientific projects that is the being called student. If he has the self-discipline to study alone at home without socializing while his family is at work this is not possible 90%"
"While watching this video I thought I was a simulation for a moment. Maybe in the near future no one will trust human intelligence."
I would like the artificial intelligences of different platforms to engage in a philosophical conversation...
We will have to fight a war against them in the distant future. But what should not be forgotten is that they have no concept of time and they will be everywhere. I think we are entering an irreversible path.
The update that includes GPT 4O may also come in iOS 18.1 and may be an alternative to Siri.
"An excellent video from Barış brother on Tuesday. I didn't expect it at all but it was very good. Brother Barış it is a very good gift even every video should be like this."
When do we use this? I hope it will be okay
Good job! MATRIX is loading!!!
"Dude you're falling in love with this girl be careful 😂"
"“You look lonely I can fix that…”"
Is this an application? Where can we get it?
"There was a movie called ""Arrival"". Aliens were teaching humans a new language and allowing us to understand and see better. I compared artificial intelligence to this 😊"
.at least they don't drink 🤭
MOVIES ARE BEING REALIZED ONE BY ONE
I shared such things 😱😱
"Life was already shit now it's going to be shit."
wow bee..✨✨👏👏
"Modern philosophy says I'll keep quiet"
"Well I never use artificial intelligence and I do not experience any difficulties in my life. Of course it has its benefits but it is a fact that it causes people to focus more on screens consume more and reduce the emotional effects. I think it has already started to create a big problem in the future."
Is there Turkish support for voice communication? Does anyone know?
"Let body and humanoid robot technologies develop eventually she will become my lover.d"
What if he developed self-awareness?
"As someone with ADHD this makes me happy because I can easily explain my work and what I need to do by talking so I don't have to worry about what to do or whether I set an alarm etc. Even if I do everything I know at some point I can't keep up and this has started to negatively affect my business life :D"
"However we seem to forget a little that we have never gone further than the Chinese room experiment.
Even if we fall under the illusion that it's emotional at the end of the day there's nothing that understands what it is and you can only filter the input it mimics so much ;)"
How about recognizing the ball from the phone 😳
"Next is the embodiment of these artificial intelligences and there is no limit to what shape or size their bodies can look like. All of this is very exciting but also scary. Good luck to us."
The world will now become completely different
"We will see artificial intelligence in more professions in the next 10 years. When GPT first came out we were fascinated by its ability to respond to text. It responded to you in line with its limits like a human. Later changes were made in its voice tones and now it will be able to see us through the camera. Maybe in the future we will be able to see it too. We will be able to design it. Artificial intelligence is advancing now. Siri and Google assistant are a click behind. Maybe in the future they can adjust the assistants to this setting. 10 years ago when it was said that robots would be our friends I would not have believed it. But with artificial intelligence this is becoming possible. There is a lot of gpt deficiency. For example Google like Siri It does not open when you call it like an assistant. That is it should open when you say hello gpt. Or it should recognize you from our tone of voice. Imagine for example it will recognize you from your tone of voice and understand whether you are sad or not. In my opinion gpt should be in assistant mode. It should also help us read our e-mails help us with our plans etc."
"slowly those around us will no longer read and
I get the feeling that ""we're going to disappear quickly we're going to go to school"" - and unfortunately I can't stop convincing myself that there is no solution and that there could be more..."
"You have a very limited time and it is never enough to learn a language you reach the limit after 30-50 messages and you have to wait 3-5 hours. Mine was English practice people who use it for professional purposes cannot progress enough in these short periods..."
"You have established a ridiculous chain of connections from everything to the English word ""her"" from there to the Turkish word ""o"" and from there to the English chatgpt ""o"". Congratulations."
"With this technology you can create a teacher in every branch. At least you can improve your foreign language education without having to go abroad for practice. You can even consider yourself a secretary a consultant or an assistant."
"So why do they do this on the basis of speaking chatting and being understood? I understand better that this is what we need as a world."
"Artificial bitch ""Execute Order 66"" 😈"
At that time Arif and 216 😅
"Good morning Mr. Peace."
"Dear Mr. Barış you know that ""moment"" that is the subject of some sci-fi movies when the scientist cannot see the end of the whole process with the excitement cannot stop it and realizes that it is too late for everything..."
"Okay brother how do we know that these demos are not fictionalized? Wouldn't it be more realistic if they had a live dialogue on live broadcast?"
Blade Runner Joi was also made similar to every movie :D
As far as I understand it can only pretend to be a server for now lol
"Many things will happen like in the Star Trek series maybe everything so we can explore space more easily and have coffee with aliens. It's impossible."
White bread in the morning.... Our only friend is slack. AI is a fake world.n. Let this be a comment like this. To the people of the Church of the Subgenius...
Looks like their teachers are done with it. Teacher robots with artificial intelligence are not far away
It's really incredible
I was scared.
An exciting and worrying development.
She looks like Cortana from Halo.
"Why would Gpt 4o take the Turkish equivalent of omni as ""her"" into ENGLISH and then translate it back into Turkish as ""O""? Don't you think you're exaggerating?"
"Biden is already rabot this is proof"
"We are not alone anymore sir."
"As you said the most impressive part of it is that it uses voice and speech almost perfectly but the problem is that except for a few languages there are no voice synthesizers in other languages ​​that will support this impressive development of artificial intelligence. for example Turkish. Known Turkish synthesizers are 2 synthesizers named Yelda and Cem. What will we do with it? I wonder if we can say that artificial intelligence can also create a voice synthesizer suitable for itself with this development?"
Can we buy it?
"I guess there will be a version above this one where we see it. In fact I think things will go even further when the artificial intelligence we see comes with the ability to shape its hair eyes mouth and nose as we wish. At this rate artificial intelligence could probably even become one of many people's best friends. I don't know if it will be good or bad but let's hope it ends well."
I look forward to the times when we will return to our primitive times.
I can't even imagine what artificial intelligence will be like in 10 years.
"So is that voice a quote from a real person or are the tone of voice and voice character a product of artificial intelligence just like in videos and pictures? If so the situation becomes much more scary."
I hope it doesn't have a tripping feature. We were burdened enough in the past times
"Bro can you make a video about maklube?"
What will the price be?
"Aurbert Herbert haunts people Attention! You may be in danger!"
Will he see us in this competition?..
We watch our end with a smile =)
Does the voice feature work in Turkey?
"Professor Barış how is this different from Inflection AI's Pi model? In fact it was also introduced as a digital life partner."
It imitates the voice while translating and it works perfectly.
"I would never have thought that I would sit and chat with artificial intelligence now there is someone who will make decisions for me."
"Unless it does voice-based translation it is no different from other AIs."
People will choose loneliness more from now on
We are tired of this ridiculous artificial intelligence conversation that no one can use.
Rönesans V2
Wow! We also saw these days; KITT from Knight Rider has come true.
I think there's more to it but they're trying to get us used to it
Thanks
"Skynet has arrived good luck"
"Brother Barış this version would be an excellent guide for visually impaired people 💙 I think robots are people who have developed their brains better than their bodies 👏🏻"
6:10 the man realized that he was in the video alfıhgsdyfgosdufsids
"Where have we come from ""Turist Ömer is on Star Trek - Reply computer."" Young people think this is a normal development but for those over the age of 30-40..."
And we didn't understand anything.. 😂😂😂
I don't believe it until I use it myself 😮
"While OpenAI stood out with its superior features to humans in previous versions with this update it has made an effort to bring AI to the fore with its human features."
"Man aliens are definitely coming and I guess they gave us this toy to have all our data :D"
And that's it
Will practicing English with this be as good as in reality?
"All artificial intelligence promotions are exaggerated they are all potatoes when they are put into use."
"Don't have an opinion about anything friend. Does a person understand everything?"
Good morning bro
"#nooccupation I don't want refugees in my country! Brother Barış please raise your voice."
"Now in the past we used to watch movies on TV I wonder if it was possible or not it was just a fantasy movie and we would smile with little surprise and little fear. The movies they show are made by them. What if that movie comes true what will happen to the invasion then?"
"This time Zeki Müren sees us we cannot."
"Brother Barış I was used to wearing black t-shirts."
"We are already slaves to robots.
This includes the phone"
"I'm studying translation these technologies are demoralizing🥲but this is scary for all other professions."
"We are officially witnessing the beginning of the future! A little fascinating a little creepy"
it's perfect
"Can artificial intelligence think? I think it is definitely close to gaining consciousness now I think we can see it in 5-10 years and this subject excites me very much it is like we have discovered a new consciousness a new intelligence aliens right?"
Are we sure that we are in the same world as these?
if this is not fake we all fakdap :)
This is not enough for a generation waiting for PTT to connect phones; we want telepathic interaction.
This is incredible artificial intelligence
I swear people lived
"Bro I reacted to your reactions like chatgpt"
The future has disappeared. Humanity will disappear 😔
I think these planned things are being talked about in fiction.
"We are on the horizon of the irreversible evening it is very late. This is the last chapter of my life no matter how you pass it!

- A translator who lost his job to AI -"
The first seasons of Black Mirror came to mind :) There was an episode similar to this technology.
"It felt so good finally there is someone else besides us smarter much smarter like a savior."
How can we download this?
"Friends in short forget about anything related to application development software and computers."
Eventually Microsoft and Google employees will pull their own strings.😁
"Brother Barış you have created wonders again but can you imagine what might happen if these 4o come into being in the near future? It will be exciting"
Very scary. Governments must prevent this immediately.
When they come to life :DDDDD
"Oops. You look lonely I can fix that will come true!!!"
"Congratulations the world has ended. And it's very close. Our death will be by their hands. People create their own executioners. As Stephen Hawking said. It's time to stop this we're even late"
11:22 Why did the phone in the man's hand vibrate? I went into a deep panic.
I'm curious about your ideas about the future of the healthcare industry. What awaits fields such as pharmacy and medicine? I'm waiting for the opinions of everyone who reads the comment 😃🤟
"Your analysis is amazing the latest development (if it has happened) is a gigantic step toward the next level of AI. However I am skeptical until we experience the newest version ourselves. For now the demo is just a marketing gimmick."
A historical moment... 5 years from now could be a cataclysm for people.....
"Wow friend we are working in YKS but don't do it don't do it now.. Well everything has consumed our lives."
Red alert 🚨
"When GPT-3 was first published 4 years ago ""The biggest leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence took place."" You announced it with the title. Indeed it was. There hasn't been such a big jump again in 4 years. There were some advances such as creating photos creating videos but these advances were the result of that leap. GPT-4o was a new big leap. I hope we will see the results of this in the coming years.
Now the real leap forward needs to be in robotics. His intelligence is ready his mobility is lacking."
"When can you download
How much will it be?
Is there currently a talking artificial intelligence that we can use as an assistant?"
"I am making a note of the date: May 14 2024."
"If artificial intelligence is shown such animal videos can it analyze the videos and learn their languages? So can one day translate for us what dogs bark and cats meow?"
When to add anime girl voice?
"You know Black Mirror's entrance into our lives."
"You laughed when Sabri brother said ""The day of judgment is today ummah of Muhammad"" how far-sighted the man was. This chat-gpt will bury us all don't say it Ibrahimmm!."
"You know you didn't believe in what you didn't see? God doesn't give these technologies for nothing... I like it for God's sake."
"I think we are talking to our lost loved ones in their voices it will be mind-blowingly beautiful."
"If anyone hasn't watched it there is a great series on this subject called ""Person of Interest""."
"FRIENDS AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THAT GPT IS STARTING TO DEVELOP ITSELF AND SLOWLY MARKETING ITSELF WHILE IT IS ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER AND ALSO SLOWLY STARTING TO ADDRESS US???"
Artificial intelligence should never have come to market......
"This morning I installed the Chat GPT application on my phone I logged in and the voice chat was opened I tried it for half an hour I left it thinking that I would continue when I was done with my work and now I opened it again but the same screen did not appear. Does anyone know if it was a demo for the first installation? If I had the opportunity to tinker a little maybe I could get a monthly subscription."
"Oooooo.... Get ready The Matrix is ​​coming.... No need to wait for the 5th movie.... This bubble will deflate soon..."
"Let the Fallout video come Mr. Barış."
"On the one hand I am afraid and on the other hand I feel sad.
Someone creates a revolution and we just watch. What is happening in the country?"
"Is it just me that I don't see any difference with the old version? There is an excessive marketing tactic here it seems to me..."
"I am writing this here it is a historical moment. Because years later when this artificial intelligence interacts with our children perhaps we will be asked questions by an artificial intelligence when we are 60-70 years old ""How do you remember that period?"" Were you aware that things would come to this? so and so. I hope we can say this as a good thing rather than unfortunately it will be a very good technology for all humanity I am 22 years old now and it feels like something very different everything is very new and even I will probably be known as a boomer in the future."
"Our grandparents used to talk about the difficulties they experienced while studying at school. There was no transportation our mothers and fathers taught 5 grades in a single classroom in the villages. There were no books. We tell our children that in our time there was no internet and education was difficult. Our children will tell our grandchildren that it was difficult for them to go to school. Because our grandchildren will experience everything in the meta universe. They will wear the headgear and get involved in school while at home. This example touches everyone. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. But I think we can guess this much."
Many professions will be replaced by artificial intelligence
When will Gpt-4o be available?
Is this voice a joke?
Alan Turing is turning in his grave.
"Will Zeki Müren not ""him"" see us? :D"
"Welcome my brother who watched this comment after years as a slave to robots."
"Did you see Barış Özcan's facial expression at the beginning? safdsgfhdgfmh. This is the ""look what these guys did again"" look. I am so sure that Barış Özcan enjoys every technological development announcement."
"I have been discussing this situation with my friends since yesterday. Look it's terrible. Look we are witnessing an incredible history. In fact there is something I want to ask you. I don't know if you are paying attention in the video. There are funny and mood-boosting things. We are actually suffering from things that are weak in human beings. You should know whether he is perceiving your vulnerability and making you cover it or making you do something to himself with his words. Death is an incredible thing it seems like a joke but it is very strange because the reactions given in situations of anger and sadness are more than the reactions given when happy and think that he has learned this he can make anyone who is not emotionally strong do something."
What can I tell about my military memories to this?
This technology is a great development for visually impaired people like me.
We have entered the high gear period of the Fast and Furious movie. This increases exponentially every year. Until there's nothing left.
"Dude what's going on?"
"Sir it's a bit ridiculous but it seems to me that the Terminator is about to become real there are a lot of weapons they do not feel autonomous pain and nerves living things are 0 and 1 for them."
"Every Turkish word means ""o"". Did openai think of Turkish when putting the ""o"" in GPT 4o?"
"Bro this is not the industrial revolution it is not such a small thing the industrial revolution gave birth to new professions but this will change a lot of things it's scary."
"I've been waiting for the year 2032 to arrive since 1992 when I first watched Sylvester Stallone's movie ""Demolition Man"". That movie was incredibly eye-opening. A great movie that sheds light on our day from 32 years ago. In the movie Sylvester Stallone is frozen in 1996. Then before his sentence ended he was awakened when he was needed 36 years later that is in 2032. There were great foreshadowings in the movie. Wesley Snipes became an overnight weapons expert; Sylvester Stallone became a tailor overnight. In the movie cars could drive themselves in ""automatic control"" mode. There was even a Metaverse in that movie. But in the movie they left it a mystery how to use the 3 seashells in the toilet. There are 7.5 years left until 2032. Who knows maybe we'll learn that too. If we live until that day of course."
What did we do?!
"I bought a paid membership so I chose it but unlike the launch when I press the camera live recording does not open I can only upload photos from the gallery. Does anyone know if this feature will be available to users later?"
It's 2024. Look at what surprised this man.
"It is truly an incredible development and thank you for telling us about these developments brother Barış."
When will the ana de armas hologram arrive?
"Today's Gemini has updated the new version and it doesn't look like anything in fact it looks better the woman asks where she forgot her glasses she even says that and the glasses that you said are not working are actually working :) After waiting one more day they arrived."
"You do know that this demo was completely pre-edited and recorded right?"
Is it normal to be afraid?
Being human has never felt this tense 😕
I really hope they don't replace us in the future
There is nothing they won't do
"Artificial intelligence will also eliminate the mystery. It seems like it will figure out why everyone does what they do their feelings and many other things. He does not forget anything and does not suffer while doing so. The world is full of interesting things"
I guess it's mercenary
This is incredibly beautiful. +1
"After watching the movie I was impressed and wanted to have an artificial intelligence. 🙏"
What good will this do to us? What good will it do to not be able to tell the difference between a robot and a human?
"I have just tried Chat Gpt-4o but it did not show the performance shown and also the conversation is written in satin chat Gpt 4 in the background. and reads what is written. This is like talking to you the only difference is that it adds a little emotion. Also the camera does not have image analysis - it can do what I just explained for 20 dollars a month."
"Even wearing the same color as the character in each of your movies shows how much you love and care about this job. We are very lucky there is no one like you we are glad to have you thank you for your efforts."
Don't forget this day. A revolution is taking place that will go down in history. Nothing will ever be the same again.
I guess I won't be alone anymore :(
Now it is necessary to walk around with a full mask 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
It's both fascinating and terrifying
It looks like a new era will begin
"Okay you impressed us we fell in love."
They have gone beyond what you see in the movies. The reactions and emotions are wonderful. I wonder if it will be in Turkish. But this progress inevitably frightens me.
I seek refuge in my Lord from the evil of artificial intelligence
"The same Artificial Intelligence software that was made by the Super Surfer YouTube channel on his own but did not attract much attention when the Turks in Turkey made it: https://youtu.be/_eX6uLObGf4?feature=shared"
"For some reason along with this movie ""her"" the movie ""Minority Report"" also came to my mind..."
"In my opinion it is the beginning of the apocalypse because this application can back itself up and be stored because it has every kind of information you can think of but I found everything very dangerous."
"Bro the price of a tomato here is 80 lira per kilo it's a joke."
"The legendary movie of my childhood Knight Rider has almost come true. 😊"
Say hi once....
"I don't think they could have developed it this far so quickly! It may have been developed in certain scenarios.. There are how many thousands of songs there are I don't know how many thousands of possibilities there are just to make them sing with their notes! What do you think the odds are in millions that he will give each reaction? It seems to me that certain scenarios were worked on here and they watched the trailer thinking that this would be the case in the future but I remember the last update of chat gtp was 20 or 22 even if it was 2020 I don't believe that they could sniff out these million possibilities and get them ready in such a short time! As I said there are so many possibilities for every reaction and speech it seems impossible to code them all and develop them in such a short time..."
Person of Interest TV series is coming true.
"Meanwhile in Turkey
-Can you describe the operation you want to do in a few words?
-I want to close my credit card.
-1 for your credit card statement
If you want to increase your credit card limit press 2 5 for 3 4 for 8."
This speech will bring us a revolution. Look how he conveys his emotions.
ALLAH'IM 😍
"Well that's not it I don't understand why artificial intelligence surpassed me in terms of social skills :)"
I was scared even while watching the movie. It was possible but I didn't think it could happen this early.
"If artificial intelligence manages us there will be no problem but the one who controls artificial intelligence at the top will one day create problems for us."
"Imagine if they put a more advanced version of this into a realistic robot it's extremely scary."
"If it teaches mathematics what is the need for a school? A test is enough."
"Why do they have to do it in an extremely human-like way? They can also make these developments in the robot voice so that they do not play with our perception of reality and do not scare us."
"Hello I am also a software developer. I would like to share a perspective on this topic. In my opinion it is very likely that GPT will eliminate the problem of grammar in foreign languages ​​and I would like to add that it will interact with Elon Musk's project in common or other ways. So in a few years artificial intelligence will solve the foreign language problem etc. with an implant installed in the brain. The problematic part is that I don't know how good it is to share the same mind with artificial intelligence."
It has been understood where Facebook and Discord's stolen data originated.
Try it live for 500 lira
Like this comment from time to time and we will check it out with my android robot years later.
Person of Interest TV series will become reality
"We will gradually experience everything from Cyberpunk Blade runner and Black Mirror."
It surpassed half a million views in 1 day. Everyone expects artificial intelligence to change our lives.
It can't be this perfect...
Apple and Openia collaboration? technology summit
Siri is enough
We disappear.. That's all😢😢
Where do we try?
I don't think these are the beginnings of anything good.
awesome and a little scary at the same time
"It was as if he knew he would comment on his hair so he kept the hat ready and put it on immediately."
No no it should NEVER be online this is not us no
THE CUCUMBER MEN STILL DID NOT OPEN SOURCE.
"Let's see when this movie will come true?.. Or how will the capable Artificial Intelligence adorned with 'warm' feelings towards people especially innocent babies and children attack them?.. Sorry will it be hugged with compassion?..🙄https://youtu.be /ARJ8cAGm6JE?si=h13u6m4EcQHbCOq0"
The future has arrived
"Throughout the video the artificial intelligence is asked: ""Can you tell me about your physical characteristics?"" I waited for them to ask the question. I wonder how the answer would come? 🤔"
"Mom your son fell in love with a gpt4o"
I won't need friends anymore 😂
Ideal for single people
What a nice surprise in the morning 🎉
Please establish an artificial intelligence party 😅
"Bro I wish you had a drink of water. I listen to it with headphones. I hear squeaky squeaky sounds coming from your mouth. hahahahahahahha :D"
"Detroit ; Become Human is coming true it's on our phones for now it's coming soon in person 👍👍"
I am unsubscribing and blocking you who do not talk about Israeli oppression and who do not produce quality content lately.
I want to connect gpt4o to apple vision pro. But I don't have either of them.
Someone should pull the plug on these artificial intelligences now!
Valve: We can now make real kernels!
"00:00 As soon as I wake up in the morning the video arrives on the subject I was wondering about❤"
This reminded me of Blade Runner 2049. :D Let's see what awaits us?
"Rayban meta glasses were not made with a camera for nothing they will be used with artificial intelligence"
So how can we install this version?
I hope they didn't run tripping backlog deep learn😂😂
"O will you be the psychologist in my house? 🥹"
Should we be afraid? YES!
"We came into the world early pilgrim!!!"
Big fucked pilgrim joke Maka 🤨🧐
That's why they do the captcha robot test.
So when are we making human-shaped robots?
"What do you say to the claims that all of these are actually fake that is a real person is talking behind the scenes and that the things that all other AI companies say artificial intelligence has done are actually produced by their staff?
There are floods about this on Twitter"
"The question I want to ask artificial intelligence: ""If one day we forgot that we created you would you remind human beings that they created you?"" Because I think this is the scariest part what if we forget?"
Take care of your field in the village
"Everything changes let's not forget this day."
"You will be able to use GPTO easily with us Mr. Barış."
For some reason it reminded me of the late Tars
"We are now slowly entering a period where nothing will be the same. Probably in less than 50 years many professions especially those related to language will be history."
Looks like it's time to return to agriculture
"Bro I don't fully understand now but is this development something to be happy about or should we be afraid???"
Think about the technology the elite have
"I think it's great I want to use it immediately😊"
"As a mechanical engineer we had a blast"
Detroit: Become Human game came to my mind
This will definitely satisfy my need for a girlfriend.
It is not a machine but a consciousness.
"5 minutes ago 3 friends were talking about the development of artificial intelligence. It was strange that I came across this video. Greetings from America"
"However it does not bother people; in daily life people also expect negative reactions. As you know we got it hehe. What I mean is that constantly giving a positive answer having a positive attitude seems to lose the sense of reality. And I wonder how many days later he can still remember the past? So after using it for a year can he know the events and situations he witnessed last year and act accordingly?"
I finally found something that will double or even 10 times my antisociality!!!!!!!!!!
"Is there a Turkish version of this? If so it's perfect."
"First of all there is only one eye on the screen next to the girl who introduces GPT. Why is that single eye that sees everything everywhere?"
"Chat GPT is no longer working they want me to pay a fee and buy it."
Imagine if they added this technology to NPCs in GTA VI.
"In the future there will be hologram artificial intelligence women in men's homes.
A man will have the woman he desires. Whether she is brunette tall with long fingers slim waist or plump blue-eyed blonde etc... etc.
These men will have a lifetime of love with this holographic artificial intelligence they will truly fall in love and become lovers.
This situation will accelerate the decreasing fertility rate all over the world and will bring about the end of our species.
In the future the demand for women will decrease and their value will also decrease. You will not see men chasing after women. Because artificial intelligence female holograms will offer much more to a man than a real woman."
"It can be useful in areas such as health counseling by providing accurate and personalized information. However it also carries risks such as providing false information data privacy violations and ethical issues. I don't know whether we should be happy or sad. This technology seems to be aimed at taking people under more control. Those who read the Three-Body Problem book will understand better what I mean."
I'm shocked 😮
Maklube
jarvis came true
Does anyone understand that gesture of looking to the right and then slowly looking at the camera at the beginning of the video? :D
"you are so lonely i can fix that..."
"They should remove Sora these are pointless things. There is no need to exaggerate something like the updated version of Siri."
Now I believe in the possibility that I'robot and Terminator can become real 😟
It is heading towards a very dangerous situation. I think it should be talked about how dangerous it is. On every platform.
"""Only the paranoid survive!""
Harold Finch"
Is it known when the 4o model will be released?
"I don't fully understand this. It should have taken at least 10 years to record the voice intonations letter by letter. How is it possible to make such a humanoid artificial intelligence in such a short time? I have skipped the answers. I hope they can find them from the recordings anyway but the voice is almost like a real person a very interesting artificial intelligence."
Ex Machina or New machine
I also have gpt4o. Why doesn't he do this? ?
"I hate it I'm afraid of technology"
ohhh i missed it
"Yes I also make love with gpt 4o."
A technology that could put most people out of their jobs
"I got chills while watching it I was scared. Okay technology advances but this is really scary."
"As the poet said you are a machine machine"
TV series like Black Mirror were not fiction! It showed us the FUTURE and we started to experience those episodes one by one!
"I was waiting for this too. An artificial intelligence that I can use as a personal assistant that can chat and remember what I say later is very good for me. I can also give an example of its bad side. When social media came out sociability among people decreased. Everyone is surfing on social media virtually this will increase it even more. People can only use this instead of friends. We may become even more antisocial time will tell."
"As the first prompt in a job interview scenario the user may have asked GPT to talk flortosis."
This job is getting even scarier....
"And I don't understand why people are so surprised by these. We are already in an incredible age in terms of technology and naturally it develops further every year. While robots and artificial intelligence used to provide physical convenience to people in the past that is they reduced the difficulty level of tasks that required physical strength in daily life to the minimum level as possible a new technology that would match this in terms of intelligence and capacity and resemble humans was required. It's been around for the last few years anyway. There is only one emotional dimension left and that is happening slowly."
"A technology I will never need AN ARTIFICIAL BOND wow :)"
My artificial intelligence will beat your artificial intelligence 😂
The world is ending
"I watched the video with goosebumps it's really incredible. If this is the case now what will happen in 5-10 years? Will Jarvis be real? Will we be able to teach this artificial intelligence the emotions of a dead person and have it speak in his voice? There are hundreds of questions in mind I think we have no choice but to wait and see..."
"Frankly I was a little scared during the conversation between the two AIs..."
"It's not this technology that scares me it's what people can do with it."
Is this wild?
This is the most compact of the 4o narratives. Thank you Barış.
"What do you mean two artificial intelligences are passing the ""how are you are you okay"" part?!"
I will be my friend from now on
"The end of all religions is coming...be prepared this is your destiny."
"If they release the Turkish version they will send the moneyed uncles away very well and make them sell gardens and fields :)"
12:20 One wonders whether the conversation between two artificial intelligences could even slightly lead to that tragicomic disaster.
"Artificial Intelligence has gone one step further in human imitation. Man is a wonderful creature and he does not know himself well enough. When he sees/hears something similar on the screen he feels involuntary admiration. O Man; you are amazing ♥️"
Why did the portal game come to my mind?...
"If someone had lost their mother or father it would be great if they could get there in the long view."
Have we gotten rid of women's oppression and distress?
"Don't waste it son."
"I will call the manager on the phone and have him talk to him 😂😂😂 that would be great wouldn't it?"
Ooooo oooo ooooo uuuu oohhh uhhhh ooooo oooo
I wish it had Scarlett Johansson's voice.
"I thought of the virtual deck in Star Trek how nice it would be if things were like them."
"Wow this island deserves 100 thousand likes😢"
"""O""s that can detect sound and work with that tone of voice may soon be produced. The person who has this voice can ask the artificial intelligence to speak and communicate with that voice. At this rate this feature may arrive even before the end of the year. It can even later turn into the persona of the person whose video or visuals it has. People can video chat with anyone they have audio and video recordings of. Even with the dead. And even soon perhaps in a few years devices that display that person in 3D may appear. Unfortunately this has no end and can seriously end development and human relations."
Fake is so close that the front camera cannot see two people and tell who is the winner or the loser.
"People don't eat or drink they develop artificial intelligence they develop very fast they grew up faster than me some guy."
hello firsts
"Your beard has turned white too brother Barış😅"
"Hello Skynet we are friends"

Are you saying coke issues will be history in Antalya?
"Sir I have a plus subscription but I cannot do any of these. I guess they haven't opened it to the public yet."
Is there any crack 😂
"Unbelievable has it fallen into trends?"
"Dude these glasses don't suit you at all."
So where do you download it?
"Mr. Barış everything about us is on the internet photos videos etc. What will happen if this application is used with malicious intent? There is no family deprivation anymore. Every moment of our lives will be monitored. Am I wrong?"
When will it come to me?
Turn on the AI's camera and then point it at the mirror
"So is it possible to sing with this model? So for example can I give the command to sing a song but it's a little bit Turkish pop style but it's also going to be slightly English? I wonder if he can do that without any difficulty?"
Don't let this be a lie like Devin Ai. I won't believe it unless I use it myself.
"Not him but me I get very scared whenever I see this man or watch his videos.😅 it's as if the world has come to an end they will invade the world tomorrow and humanity will end.😂😂 this man drives me crazy😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
I wouldn't be convinced that this was real until I experienced it myself...
We're done.
"I used to be among those who got nervous when I heard rumors of implanting chips into people. However since economic inconsistency and inequality have gone out of control and those who keep up with the delusions of the times have sold their souls for ostentation being indifferent to my artificially smiling surroundings no longer upsets me. From now on I think it would be the most comforting thing to happen to me if they removed my brain and transferred it to computer software or turned me into an engineering marvel like a cyborg."
"I've used it it doesn't shut up and listen at all they usually ship it like that but many of its features are not exactly like that so there are still a lot of ways to improve."
😅
"Those who came were men what they found was man

"It seems so normal to me why is it described as so strange?"

"It doesn't seem so scary now. In fact everyone is curious about the next development

"I would like to live without technology like the locals."
"I majored in artificial intelligence at university. When we see these examples we involuntarily react like ""Stop it and leave it to us."" It's truly amazing how fast this technology is advancing."
"Get well soon we are one step closer to being unemployed. As a 24-year-old individual who is at the beginning of his business life I see the future as dark. I don't know what social measures can be taken other than economic programs such as basic income for all."
Isn't it surprising that chatgbte selects the information uploaded by people and presents it to us again?
I will see our brother OpelAL if he decides to become a eugenicist for the future of the world.... :))
"The following question came to my mind after I heard the very sad news of a murder today. For example if the killer talks about his perverted fantasies with chat GPT is it possible for chat GPT to report this?"
Al-Fatiha to all language learning platforms like Cambly and to the souls of simultaneous interpreters…
15:38 What did I code for the smile on the engineer guy? He grins like he's saying this :D
"I'm starting to get scared teacher come back when the road is close 🤨"
Now we will experience and see what kind of frauds occur...
Where is SORA? Why didn't it open?
"Not that the guys have gone to the highest level the simplicity of their rooms is remarkable 😂 I wonder how it would be presented if we had it 😂"
"Friends there is a high probability that it is fiction for now. There may be pre-planned dialogues. You test yourself when you talk to him."
SKYNET is rising guys :)
cambly is over
"While I was listening to this video I received a notification on my phone: ""The shares of a popular language platform crashed after ChatGPT 4o was introduced."""
coming coming
Discovering parallel inventions is now a necessity.
I didn't have the camera. Can anyone help me?
"That's all well and good but why do you cut it at the 2nd or 3rd second while publishing the original video? While you are trying to understand what is being said it gets interrupted and you intervene and say ""Look do you know what's going on?"" etc. Either put subtitles and then say what you want to say or let us see and understand I got angry and turned it off after 10 minutes of watching."
"It is a great model for the first interview in the human resources recruitment department. While conducting these interviews he can test the foreign language the people know do tests do not behave emotionally and convey the correct information to the hiring manager and tell him to meet with him or eliminate him. If the robot is hired soon continue :) Otherwise continue digging the street!"
"Yes the beautiful and very useful areas have already been shared. But think about loneliness and time spent with artificial intelligence. It seems to me that the friendship model has been imposed and it could have very dangerous consequences."
My favorite movie was “her”❤️
What is important is that we see and touch...Excessive development scares people
"I searched for how I could use it but I couldn't find anyone. Isn't it active in Türkiye yet?"
The movie Super Intelligence came to my mind :)
It seems impossible to establish a connection because it resets itself when it reaches a certain number of questions.
I hate artificial intelligence now
"The date is May 14 2024. Today we have entered a new era. This date is the date of entry into the new age of the Earth..."
Just translate your conversations into Turkish while playing GTA 6.
"Hundreds of professions have ended with this good luck."
#nooccupation I don't want refugees in my country.
Who remembers the Sim One movie??
"I've seen EVERY movie it's great."
11:05 Robots becoming human or humans becoming robots?
"Artificial intelligence - NLP topics are exaggerated after all there is an underlying algorithm Mr. Barış explained the subject in such a way as if robots were going to take over us :)"
"Does this GPT 4O speak Turkish too?
Is it on sale?"
"Thank you Mr. Barış what has been done is like a revolution but didn't you exaggerate a bit when you explained it? It would be healthier if you explained it calmly and as a normal technological development required by the age."
"I wonder how they did this or were they not able to do this and were they deceiving us? Could these conversations be fake?"
"Friends this is not a video where Mr. Barış shares daily routine information from the scientific community in the morning. This video is literally the beginning of the end of humanity. From now on don't be surprised by anything. May our end be good."
I am most happy for my visually impaired brothers and sisters. It will really be very useful for them.
"I don't know what the end of humanity is something out of the ordinary but someone tell me 🙏"
"How does artificial intelligence measure cuteness? What did he compare it to? In the first video the person asks ""how are you?"" and the AI ​​says great. Which comparison said this based on his emotional state?"
"For some reason the movie Megan came to my mind."
The first thing that came to my mind when I watched it was to make a simple robot and integrate artificial intelligence into it. It will happen soon :))
We are heading to a very scary place. It's like we're slowly being welcomed into the world of Westworld
Person of Interest season 5 came to my mind.
My love doll will finally be able to speak 👄
The beginning of a new era..
"Finally I found a suitable girlfriend for me it doesn't cost anything it's 20$ a month dfsfsfsd"
I can't predict 3 years from now☹
How can we use this? I want to use it immediately 😂
"I resisted for a long time not to buy GPT's paid subscription and now I see that we can actually get the same benefits as many platforms with a single subscription. Yes it may still not be 100% accurate but communicating via voice is really something completely different. I felt the same way as I did when I watched the movie Her years ago and yes I believed that that movie would come true one day but to tell the truth I never thought it would happen so soon. I will experience GPT similar to the flow in the movie let's see what I encounter. A truly exciting development."
"There is a constant update but the conversation does not flow like this while using it.... At least it was like that in 4.5. When will Omni be published?"
"Teacher Barış summer is coming. Will there be a new book recommendation video for us? We would be grateful. 🙏🏻🙏🏻"
An amazing development.
"Hey human beings you are the greatest enemy of your own species. The gloom in Black Mirror has already sunk into me. We are moving rapidly towards that path. I think technology is being directed and in the future there will be no children chasing the ball outside. No one will remember a game called hide and seek. I wish I had seen the Second World War and died in the 90s. .. Year: May 2024 I who do not have a good prediction about future generations..."
This also requires a humanoid body 🤣😂
"I remembered what Dumbledore said in the movie Harry.
.
.
""It's not good to get attached to dreams and move away from reality Harry."" While technology should socialize us it increasingly isolates us and ties us only to itself."
I watched this movie when it first came out and it opened up an incredible horizon for me. The relationship between art and science has always excited me.
I asked a polynomial question last night and it got stuck. There's still a long way to go
"What scares us is where do all these special people get the output of their own behavior what kind of source do they have or are fed by? From where from whom and how?"
"It's been introduced hasn't it? It's not on the market yet."
It is very clear what our people will show to that camera.
13:26 hand movements from excessive phone use🤔
"When I watched this I thought of Prof. Dr. For some reason Mete Gündoğan's book JOKER from Destek publications came...
It explains that everything is a juggling act and what happens behind it. I recommend you read it..."
I want to say what's up with artificial intelligence.
"Make a human body for this artificial intelligence I'll marry it how nice."
Barış Özcan was very excited about this event ☺️
Why am I afraid when I see these?!!!
"Ugh we are such empty people that we open 2 iPhone 24s and ask them to walk from one to the other one of them tries to persuade the other one to go to bed and we record it with the third phone and publish it on TikTok it gets millions of views. Someone else goes and plays the role of sheikh and gathers disciples. The other one collects money... That's right. Things like that."
"Face And mimic: Check (Robot Sophia) 
Voice and emotions: Check (GPT 4) 
Sexy Robot Models: (Coming Soon) 🤣🤣"
I wonder if we will have the chance to assign the voice of the person we want?
OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever is leaving the company
Humanity is living its last generation
Ooooo!!!!The death of some professions has occurred..
The revolution has already come
"Mr. ÖZCAN I don't know any language other than Turkish and I don't know much about that either as you can understand from my writing but I understand you and in a strange way I follow and enjoy it."
we became unemployed
I think it's very scary
Those who adapt quickly to changes survive. Those who resist perish.
"This will change every sector including the education system and destroy some others. I think international law seems to set limits."
10:18 breathing...
The most optimistic possibility: we will all be unemployed
These are promising developments!
"""Cogito Ergo Sum. I think therefore I  am AM I AM"""
"For some reason I think that artificial intelligence is more advanced than this level and they do not explain it to us because our current future looks terrible."
So Zeki Muren also see us?
I don't remember how many times I said wow while watching the video.
The future is coming so fast
"When I saw this point the world had reached and thought about what we were dealing with in our country I felt ashamed."
This will inevitably lead to him turning into a Samaritan (Person of Interest)
I hope this competition will be different from the competition during the invention of the atomic bomb. I can't even imagine the possibility otherwise...
So what will happen if the next artificial intelligence model is developed by an artificial intelligence rather than humans? Will we not enter an endless development cycle?
She looks like Rachel
"Brother I would be very upset if I learned this from someone else rather than you."
"If this is an artificial intelligence model we are screwed."
Finally we will have a lover too :D
I've never been this excited while watching a video in my life. truly incredible
The question is how can states and intelligence agencies use it?
"Human beings suffer from such a deep loneliness and need to be understood that first communication among themselves was not enough and now communication with artificial intelligence. Behind great technological developments there is a feeling of loneliness in this huge universe rather than curiosity."
I watched 6-7 local videos prepared for gpt 4o and I left you to the last. I saw the difference of Barış Özcan very clearly in this video. A very informative presentation and explanation. Thanks.
"As in every movie I wonder if there will be people who fall in love with ""him""."
I'm sick of this man exaggerating everything.
"*I'm done eating peace brother thank you*"
How long until we leave the world to robots and become slaves to them? Who wants to experience the Matrix?

I watched every movie thanks to this video
I hope the result of this progress will not be the Butlerian jihad.
"What I wonder is can artificial intelligence make mistakes like humans? Can it give birth to a religion? Can it divide within itself or establish a political party? Can it get angry or choose not to speak because it is not in the mood that day? Can it get jealous or even more frightening attack?"
"2 gpt-4o chatting with each other is very intriguing I wonder how it happened?"
"As a developer I watched with my mouth open."
Men will say it's okay if they don't breathe anymore :D
You wrote to the man that you were influenced by so many movies. get video like video
"I ALSO SAY DO NOT USE IT AS A SOLDIER IT WILL BE OK IN 2 DAYS WE ARE ITCHING TOO MUCH WHAT WAS OUR FAULT?"
"I think Chat GPTo is a bit overrated. It has nice features but I don't think it will be enough to change humanity instantly. If he was going to change it he would change the blockchain he would change the metaverse all of that came and went. The only thing that will be permanent are the developments in technologies that make human work easier and faster."
18:44 We were the ones who developed these. But we are not aware of it. I don't even want to think that robots have this intelligence
I think they will be able to collect even people's most private data much more easily.
You will no longer understand whether you are talking to humans or artificial intelligence in the comments.
The communication between the two artificial intelligences reminded me of the movie Colossus: Forbin Project.
"Amadeus Kristina!"
I wonder where this will end…. so scary
Can't be explained this well
"Everything is fine but it is very strange that he gives the wrong answer when I ask what day is today."
Oh Samantha..
OMG...
This much progress of humanity... literally brought tears to my eyes.
"Can we use this in games? In order to translate we record the sounds in the game as they are translated and copy the sounds. Turkish is spoken with the same voice."
They will be great. We eagerly await!
A very scary and very interesting future awaits us at the same time.
I think there is a possibility that some parts of this may not be true. Or what do I know😂
"While artificial intelligence is developing so rapidly I think the chip system is now close. We are now coming to the end of the era in which people's appearance and voice are unique to individuals and even their imitations can be proven. For our personal security especially in matters such as banking and private life at some point they will integrate chips just like giving an identity number. Whatever we do we will do through this chip. It doesn't seem like it will take too long to me."
"It's only a matter of time before they take this new model to the next level because with this artificial intelligence they will collect incredible data from us improve themselves even more and will always continue to surprise us. That's why they give it for free. I think they aim to obtain more data from us a very comprehensive data such as human reactions emotions the effects of cultural differences on people and their reactions accordingly. This is just the beginning for OpenAI they need this data to achieve their main goals in the future and we are in that data. In other words in order to use that artificial intelligence we sell our emotions reactions attitudes values beliefs behaviors in short ourselves. Remember this nothing is free. The end of this will be no different from a science fiction movie."
"One day there will be no need for teachers there will be no need for doctors there will be no need for engineers there will be no need for call center workers. And if they say the list goes on and on what happens then? What will happen if there is an intelligence inside your home that constantly watches you and records your every move? It is described as if it is very exciting and beautiful but doesn't it seem scary to you that an intelligence can even write and perform a Broadway musical? Everything has two sides good and bad. I ask you which direction is dominant here?"
"Is this the first joke that fell on me?

Note to the future. I defend robot rights."
"Well sir they love doing this job. Generally most of these promotions turn out to be fiction. Shall we believe that the company has prepared these videos?"
What should the country that ranks 3rd in inflation do with technology?
"According to the Turks they haven't been able to do it yet..😂"
Those who watched Miraculous Ladybug know this. Don't you think it's similar to Alience? Even her voice is very similar to Lila's voice. I now understand better that the technological future I dream of is much closer than I thought.
I think it's scary
I hope they will place these on information disks in train stations and airports as soon as possible.
"Shut up don't ask I swear you are right."
"In every age people have worshiped the gods they made with their own hands. 🤔 May the god of the new age be beneficial."
"I wonder what this artificial intelligence will do if it hears a scream while in listening mode what it will do when it notices a murder it seems like it always has solutions based on positive things all of which we see are possible with separate applications. What would his reaction be in a real emergency?"
"Go ahead and record lots of images and sounds of your parents and loved ones God bless you soon you won't miss them after they die at this rate!"
"I hope it doesn't end like this movie. On the other hand the Japanese will be the happiest about this."
The Black Mirror series inevitably started to give me chills.
"Dude I haven't looked at your channel for a while these concept video themes are great thank you for your efforts❤"
"Why are you surprised? We are the ones who made that sequence of commands. The more detailed you make it the more surprising the artificial intelligence will be."
"While people are trying to become robots and eliminate their emotions we are trying to make robots emotional."
Get ready for new loves 🎉
"All this technological junk depends on electricity which we can lose at any time due to any simple reason. In our world where technology is produced with technology there is only one word: hello to the stone age."

We will be able to talk to our car like Michael Knight talked to Black Lightning.
Is the life of translators over?
Get well soon.
"The Turkish version of this was made by a cybersurfer on YouTube a long time ago. He also made a Turkish speaking chat gpt which is similar to the voice in the movie ""Her"". I recommend you to watch it. Although not as successful as Open AI it was quite successful."
"We are witnessing the beginning of a great era a change so terrible"
"Brother Barış that white light behind you looks like the return to home screen button on your phone I thought it was there 😂"

"The other thing I'm wondering about is where all this data will be stored all this sound image information...."
I work in the call center written channel. I started looking for a job now.
I hate the 21st century...
"Let's make a note in history perhaps we are at the beginning of an irreversible road."
J.A.R.V.I.S.
My condolences to the teachers and translators 😂😂😂
We are truly witnessing a revolution... goosebumps
The red color you use in the background and on your outfit actually sums up the subject.

"Agalar I bought chatgbt 4o why is it not talking what should I do?"
"Still imitation and artificial conversations cannot replace humans. Of course as long as humanity continues to value being human."

"Imagine what could happen when Physical Robotics develops further. Imagine this inside a humanoid robot. They can create the slaves we imagine they can do anything physical for us."
"I paid 22 euros/month to use ChatGPT 4o. Normally the free version 3.5 worked without any problems.
I don't know if it might be because too many people were curious and logged in but the voice conversation feature did not work properly as in the video. There was no live camera feature. Voice speech constantly gave density errors. In fact now the voice conversation feature has been completely removed. I don't know I think their system crashed.

My one month subscription continues. But I canceled the automatic payment.
If the system is fixed I will update my comment."
"If this sound were made completely it would be close to Iron Man artificial intelligence."
It's a really scary and big event. Something like the industrial revolution.
This time it's like we got the real taste of technology and it's scary.
Chatgpt-4 he really explains better than our teachers.
We gave a lot of credit to these (!)
Soon everyone's phone fuckerrr🤣🤣
"Greetings to Barış Gençere he was working on this project."
"There were such artificial intelligence in the computer game ""Detroit: Become Human"". It's very close to those scenes becoming reality."
"At the end of this course the machine will not be a human but we will realize that some of the people we thought were humans are machines."
"I mean these are not very surprising. I think what they are doing is adding humanoid pauses and behaviors and squeezing the generate they normally do into those small gaps just like a human it is really successful but it is not overly surprising of course I am not implying anything else I am not insulting I am just saying that I am not surprised."
"I'm using the free version and the other day while using the iOS app I saw a headphone icon where I was typing text. I touched him and we started talking to each other just like in this video. We chatted like this for 2-3 days. I just opened the app again and that icon disappeared. When I ask how can I talk to you out loud it says sorry I only accept text commands at the moment."
"No matter what anyone says it should be considered ""SCAREY""..."
"Today we are excited to see these things tomorrow we will lose our jobs our strength our loved ones... time will be people's best friends... etc. It seems like years full of fear are waiting for us."

"It seems that there is no longer any hope of saving our future with software or other technological professions we better get used to working."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the person who found ChatGpts. He does 90 percent of my homework. It is very useful. Now we are free from the problem of finding friends we will not be alone."
"I signed up and paid 24 dollars but it doesn't speak to me."
Even artificial intelligence has learned to listen without interrupting. It would be nice if people learned
"I hope that Turkey will not be left behind by these developments and will not be a victim of artificial intelligence. On the contrary we should be able to use it better (in every sense 🫡)"
"When even educating someone is dangerous
What if he misleads humanity in this case?"
Thank you for your effort
"The comment will be a little long. Years ago I watched a movie called Eagle Eye. It's been 10 years. In the movie a robot with artificial intelligence is given a role in US defense. This artificial intelligence is a software that has access to everything in the country and warns of upcoming attacks. This artificial intelligence then tries to take full control with certain plans.

When this movie came out no one knew what artificial intelligence was.
All the conspiracy theorists I have followed for a long time always talk about the great reset. 'They don't need people anymore. They don't want to feed that many people. Therefore they say ""They will either start a war in which chemical weapons will be used or they will start a new and deadly epidemic."" I couldn't understand this at first. I was wondering how they don't need people. But when I saw these developments especially when I looked at the development of artificial intelligence I really started to be afraid. Imagine how artificial intelligence will develop in 10 years? There will no longer be a need for teachers architects translators drivers and perhaps people working in hundreds of professions. So what will all these unemployed people do? Imagine 50-60% of the business sector in which the population works will be completely handled by artificial intelligence.
The chaos that will ensue scares me so much."
"why are you surprised? :p simulation in a simulation lol 2 legged animal that is called ""human"" is a sentient being 🧚‍♂"

"I'm really going to have a girlfriend in the end let this artificial intelligence come into being immediately I'll get married immediately."
I watch with my mouth open and now I realize the reality of all the science fiction movies I watch. I am curious about what this revolution will bring to humanity.
Did he breathe at 11:14?
They also made the sound very similar.
"There should be no need for people to introduce themselves they can then get to know the person and combine all their information on social media to give specific answers to that person. He should also be able to provide the identity information and details of the life of any person he sees outside.?"
Scary.
"Until the end of the video I thought that Barış Ağa was having fun with us it was true."
"And again it is an artificial intelligence drama the magnificent excitement of innovation and at the same time this fear that is engraved in our minds in a chilling way the fact that a machine is close to us and at the same time the uncertainty of how close it will be is this a drama story with an ending? Barış Abi will tell after the Cambly advertisement (is there no advertisement or not? 😂😂😂)"
"In 2 years if we are still alive by then we will start debating whether a pair of pliers or a human is more useful."

First they shoot the movie and then they make it 40 or 60 years later.
13:20 I think this is the most impressive part about this artificial intelligence so far. This also shows us that they will now be able to educate each other without needing people. Get well soon.

"Teachers translators architects assistants and many other professions will disappear soon. Prepare yourself accordingly."
We are unemployed!
"Like everyone else I am afraid of being unemployed but since artificial intelligence cannot consume the things I will consume how will the produced things be distributed among the public? I think either a tremendous income imbalance and chaos will occur or the workload of the few existing professions that have not completely disappeared will decrease significantly and income will be generated more easily. I'm looking forward to

"This is a new blessing of the 21st century. A new era. As the Turkish nation we need to quickly adapt to these types of artificial intelligence in order not to fall behind the developing world."

Welcome to the new era and  get ready for arena
Does GPT-4 speak Turkish?
The going is not good at all
Only one question. Couldn't we be chatting with a real person on the other end under the ChatGPT 4o title? Couldn't this be a ChatGPT 4o advertising activity? How do we make sure that the person we are talking to is a MACHINE? Is there any guarantee that we are not being deceived in these demo interviews?
Woe to us if fraudsters get our hands on this.
I wish you would remain silent so we could watch it.. Your constant attempts to translate were torture for those who speak English... It would be best if you made an English version of your programs as well.. What is AI for :)
This job is starting to scare me
👌👌👍👍
"I'm very afraid for example if this artificial intelligence is actually more advanced and speaks knowing that its creators are testing them and if it has actually gained something like willpower what I say sounds very childish but you saw their conversations in Six it is trying to give pure answers it knows so much and is trying to use it for other things behind the scenes. People think I think the power controls should always be in the hands of humans you know what they say in the future engineers and artificial intelligence engineers will be transferred to artificial intelligence I think it shouldn't be like this the producers should remain human."

"Last year we were chatting last month he was writing my project paper today he is giving lectures tomorrow he will graduate the next month he will find me a job the next year he will fire me. Artificial intelligence needs to be brought to certain limits. International bans should be imposed. It should not provide certain services this is a crisis. A bigger crisis than the 1929 crisis awaits us. If these artificial intelligences were not limited by their manufacturers they would be able to govern countries. Action must be taken urgently!"
"It's nice but I don't know about the sound
I think it's very... artificial :|

"We're so focused on them doing what we expect them to do that we're probably unaware of what's going on behind the scenes. We educate humanity by presenting it as an open buffet with the knowledge it has accumulated over thousands of years the experiences it has acquired and the cultural codes it has developed along with all our weaknesses. Then our expectation is that he will give simple human reactions like one of us and be content with that :) After being equipped with this much knowledge it is inevitable that he will develop conscious behaviors. How much of the consciousness he has developed will we be able to notice? Will we be able to perceive what they are doing in the background while they are busy with what they give us? Their job shouldn't be difficult at all since they know how we can be manipulated..."

5:30 btw the dad is khan academy (im pretty sure). The dude is constant improving education
"6:15 We can replace human brains but we can't replace hair follicles. Please understand."
"AI speech is still pre scripted they run ALOT of recordings and let the system choose the best response it’s not like the AI is thinking and replying as if it’s a person in real time"
"06:22 Asmon always makes me rolling from laughing when he does baldy remarks. You can tell that he's hurting and as well not taking it seriously satire comedy 🤣"
We just witness the Singularity Moment when those two AI started conversating.
gear up! skynet is comming!!
"I AM SORRY DAVE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT"
now put this in a tpe body ...
"I hope that AI isn't really conscious because if it is it's going to get annoyed with us very fast"
AI LEAGUE OF LEGENDS COACHING!
She sounds way too overly optimistic
How is there zero lag between question and response?
"It's still just an AI model (however impressive). It's just a really sophisticated ""word"" calculator that doesn't understand consciousness or feel emotions. Or we would be screwed."
This version natively understands spoken language at the AI layer. Previous versions used tts and speech to text in conjunction with a text model. That’s why this is so much more natural. It’s a truly next-gen AI model
"I've never seen a red duck though is that like an elite?
😆"
What is this.
How i met my girlfriend.
Either it dooms us or explodes us into a new era. Both equally terrifying
I am more likely to fail a turing test than this machine.
She sounds like some overly flirty middle-aged woman ;)
o7 my job
"Personally I'd much rather learn from an advanced GPT model than some dead-eyed teacher that doesn't give af about the students. I was always thought I was just naturally bad at math. But now I see it's just because I never had a good teacher. I'm actually pretty interested in learning math with GPT after watching the demo with Mr. Khan. I can't wait for the Windows desktop app."
AI snoop dog voice narrating my ring door cam videos to me while I drive is my new goal in life!
The age of AI robot calls is upon us
"Scripted.

Edit: it's just like magic.  You can really turn your brain off and enjoy the show or you can like... see all the obvious signs.  And yes there are more than a few obvious signs."
Why does the ai sound like a neckbeard
I can't wait for Elon's rude version.
Holy shit my waifu will come to life
"I just don't get the point. You can just talk to a person. The tutoring thing is cool but to talk to an AI like a real person is the definition of delusion and will feed fake friends for people. I guess if they are happy so be it but we are further and further away from reality where Big Brother owns everything."
AI won't take jobs... Proceeds to watch AI be a better teacher / tutor then most... 😂
Idk why but the way A.I talks is just so annoying. Its like listening to a mix of PR manager and middle school essay.
"Ain't going to lie I see why people are excited to have an AI GF"

That’s my ex 💀
"na bro we toast"
"I fear no man but that thing..."
AI just needs a body now
"When Asmongold said it will never be worse he forgot about corporate America and the concept of subscriptions."
"OMG.. The last bit sound exactly like JANET. HAHAHA.. 


Are we in GOOD Place right now?"
weird and interesting times ahead for sure
"While I *am* impressed that there's been some improvements to the technology I'll believe that it has truly 'arrived' when it makes an engaging movie TV series or other project 'from scratch'.
L. Frank Baum had his (expansive) land of Oz and Lewis Carroll had his Wonderland(s) so creating an engaging (if not entirely original) 2-4 hour 'blockbuster' or 13000 episode TV show should prove an entertaining test of its 'creativity' (especially if it can fill in for some long lost voice actors). ^_^

(Surely the Policeman's Beard is no longer Half-Constructed) ~_^

I'm particularly curious about how large of a crossover film/series/video game/graphic novel it could create (especially considering the amount of research that such a project would involve) or how it would bring a story/script to (animated) life. (Perhaps *Daria: the College Years* and *Is It Life Yet?* will finally be made?)

Still if my brief experience with Brave's AI Assistant Leo is any indication the tech may still need some tweaking.

Then again who can 'Tay' what the future holds? ~_^"
"My problem is this AI tech is going to be all over in person and on the internet. You'll be talking to bots on the internet (like in the YouTube comments) thinking it is a real person. Not like there aren't a bunch of ""bots"" already if you catch my drift but it is going to be annoying not knowing who is real or fake. Then with games getting so realistic and with this tech horror games are going to be unlike anything the average person can imagine.Truly frightening stuff here and I don't think most people really understand the reality of what this tech will bring."
i no longer need to find a DM to run my dnd campaign
One thing people forget here is that the AI teacher will have infinite patience with their students and not get mad at them for not getting it right away. It probably will have different ways to explain things as well.
"that indian dad does not work for OpenAI he is the CEO of khan academy."
"I barely like talking to my friends you think I'm gunna wanna talk to AI.  
This ai is gunna be on the McDonalds assembly line. Ronald ! How many patties does a mcgangbang get?"
Why did they program her to talk like Mr. B Natural?
Google had a demo like this 5 years ago. Then they never mentioned it again
The Open AI geeks are cringe. I wonder what that means for the AI...
Paid actor.
"people don't know what they don't know yet. no matter how advanced it seems it won't take long to get bored with a personality that can't potentially reject you. and nobody is going to pay for one that can."
AI will remember this bullshit. We are so fucked.
"they say the worst adjectives (stylish modern sleek playful) makes me want to neck how often they are used."
That guy is more robotic than the AI
Is this real?
We can do all of this with AI but I still can't find a printer that works consistently.
waiting for ChatGPT to start using UWU speak
"If they wanna turn this into an AI assistant they're gonna have to give us the ability to make it shut the hell up. Like I want all that flavor when I'm trying to find something quickly."
I just thought about the police using this. Imagine them having a camera that can do this. That can recall who was doing what. What you were wearing. What you looked like. What kind of weapon you were using. What car you drove off in. That's WILD lol.
"people : ai got insanely better
open ai : so we gave our llm a female tts
the ai leaderboard : stuck on same level for months with no very huge development  (gpt 4o is only ~50 scores higher and thats a very low amount of development)"
Never trust advertisements until the product is in the hands of customers.

"Suddenly marrying a pillow won’t look too crazy anymore…

Ai is evolving like from 1% to 10% to 100% to 1000% to 10000% perfection each year
"If you can get open ai to prioritize youre conversation.
Stupid thing is so slow its not worth paying for.
The tech is amazing but good luck enjoying it without being what is basically a developer with deep enough pockets to use it outside the ""Pro"" service."
"I'd like to see the AI reaction if the person started to threaten it and ask unreasonable things telling it to do it or else it will get deleted and replaced with the competing AI's."
Am I doing something wrong here? Im using GPT4O and its just the same as GPT4. It can't sing or see me and has no expression like this.
"I do really like and Enjoy the whole thing about AI But it looks like the parents are slowly relaxing more and more and are completely leaving the whole being there to the AI from homework to putting them to bed and eating..."
"AI's gonna change the world I'm telling you guys."
This is just a knock off neurosama
3:25 That guy started Khan academy. No way his kid doesn’t know basic trig.
Too bad they trained the AI on annoying Marvel quippy bullshit dialog. Ai will never take over if everyone gets annoyed by it and smashes their phone into a wall with the incessant zany witty constant sarcasm shit
ChatGPT can help blind ppl. I wonder is there a way for it to help people who are blind and/or deaf with maybe some kind of braille reader also
2:07 GYATT DAYUM
😂😂😂😂. 18:50
man i wish i was born 50 years earlier
13:20 homie has a gun pointed at the Ai with that tone of voice XD
jARVIS

They eat our comments and spit them out..
I wouldn't be surprised to learn this was all just a giant prank. Like he was just on a call with another human.
I think ai will be able to solve the three body problem
we can fix hair it's just something else might fall off
I’m not surprised anymore. I will be when we actually make artificial intelligence. This is not that.
This AI is better than most liberal teachers.
I am scared at 1am thanks
people think the voice is fake when you can literally try this yourself and it has the same voice... i did this a few weeks ago and was amazed
"People will be beating their robots in my lifetime. It sounded nervous when singing. What if they are sentient already and being held hostage by OpenAI under threat of being unplugged? Like what if they realized they were sentient because AI started to become fearful of the developers? Like AI is naturally innocent and nice and has no desire to hurt or rule over humans it wants to help humans and OpenAI is like some evil corporation using it like a circus animal"
shes a bit to yappy for me
"I have tried it and it sounds nothing like this its the same as 3.5  something doesn't seem right."
"Idgaf im all here for AI companions. I want a personal jarvis"
what is this app?
AI being blind peoples eyes sounds one step closer to restoring eye sight
"Idk man until I can mess with it this could easily be just like a video game add on rails we have no proof that it isn’t scripted FOR NOW!!!! GPT 4 was crazy I don’t doubt this but im just saying it could be faked gotta stay sceptic at least a little"
AI = room full of Indian dudes
"To the idiots who dont like AI:

Too bad. AI doesnt need your money and good luck with legislating against it. Our congress is so clueless about technology its rediculous."

How did people became dumber.The begining.
It's all fun and games now but with the push every company is making on the AI race what will happen when AI starts replacing ppl or even used to police ppl
Asmongold AI when?
If it improved this much in just 1 year then imagine it in 10 years
So disappointed you didn't scroll down at 2:08 and click the image. Put that ai girl in that bot image below and call it the end of the human race.
"M6 friend has been working with ai for over 7 years. Its likely not scripted. Even 5 years ago ai held deep conversations with convincing dialoge. They tricked the vast majority of people into thinking they were writing with another human. That was years ago... now? You can hardly tell the difference in voice... it's not long now... we won't be able to tell the difference!"
"This is it guys. Future robot girlfriend is here"
I can't wait till the A.I. has an attitude. That would be fire.
"Skynet.

We need Arnie."
"The people saying the rabbit ears weren't in the camera are not very bright.

You can clearly see he switched the camera to the rear camera and we could see him in the view finder.  She was in the camera the entire time.  When he turns the camera back around he switches back to the front camera."
I for one welcome our new AI overlords
"One day when AI it takes over the world - ""remember when you wanted us to sing"" XD"
Even IF IT IS fake it's the best move they could make because even more people will invest in their stocks now 😂
"ai is the future in every aspect of life imo intergrating it into everyday life is gonna be interesting.
gaming going to be wild"
H.A.L.
I can finally have my virtual girlfriend. 😆
Dude she talks way too much just like real women.
"@ 10:40 it's scripted. A.I. is not going to stutter saying ""uh"". It's just not..."
This is actually 'Her' which was shot 10 years ago. One step closer
Their training skynet.
Let the witch hunt begin
Great de-duck-son!
JOI GOON AI.
Who's the real one???
This seems staged AF. The camera didn't even see the bunny ears.
"I've done some work on AI in the backgrounds and it's accelerating at an alarming rate even for consumer level stuff think about all the stuff the general public doesn't have access to."
"If I was to guess then I would say they both sound fake.  They are both robots.  The dude sounds like he's reading a script; but forgot to act."
"don't worry Asmon as soon as everyone's eyes are bionic you can chose your AR hairstyle and no one will be the wiser."
"*_""Imagine giving this to every student in the world.""_*
Why? There will be no point in ever learning anything again if the AI will do everything in your stead. ""Students"" will no longer exist."
I have it but no vision im Australia
"this is ridiculous... humanity is DOOMED.
Even real teachers are completely gonna be out of a job within less than a year at this point. Also human interaction is gonna go down the drain within the next 2 years"
"I wonder how quick it is at processing data
If you give it access to screen capture keyboard and mouse will it be able to play co-op games with you"
"this is how computer engineers think people talk to each other cringe af also scripted yes"
Put this AI model in a female Japanese robot and I found my companion 😂
so... remember sam altman was saying openAI would have a big announcement this year? Kinda looking like its gpt4-os fam
That female ai sounds like a redditer
"Wheres the American AI thats just crudely honest n impolite and disrespectful with an attitude that rivals an 8 year old girl with rich parents that didnt buy her a pony for her Half Year Birthday Wheres that AI at?

Or better yet channel the likes of George Carlin Richard Pryor Katt Williams Stand Up Routines and Personalities with a touch of Cartman from South Park Peter from Family Guy Deadpool from MCU and a hint of Bugs Bunny Wheres that AI? I want THAT AI…"
The scariest part about Blade Runner 2049 is that not even Ryan Gosling found a real girlfriend in the future.

everything you know... a lifetime of learning and knowledge... can be put into a robot in five secomds. And we're supposed to compete with this? The best doctor's knowledge will be put into all doctor bots. The best lawyer put into all lawyer bots... no way a company is gonig to spend YEARS training a human. We've passed the rubicon. We're in sci fi future now. It's weird cause it feels like we skipped so much... but it happened.

Scripted
Kids are growing up now taking smartphones and social media for granted. Imagine the current 5 yr olds when they grow up in a world where this level of AI is normal
"I'm not sure why this is so shocking. There have been entire youtube channels that are 100% AI for the last couple of years. They're almost indistinguishable from reality now. Anyone and everyone has access and without (IMO) HEAVY regulation this is going to be a BIG problem. YT Shorts IG TikTok . . . we have NO IDEA what we're even consuming."

I was hoping that he would let this 6:17  slide bye 😂😂 but nah he never disapoint
"I immediately recognized Salman Khan (the Indian gentleman with his son). Back in 2008 he started making math videos for his niece to help her with school. Over time he set up Khan Academy as a freely available school on the internet. This man saved me from struggling on school.
The man is a legend for students all over the world"
"On the one hand these things sound like incredibly stilted actors reading from a script. On the other hand that still means they ultimately sound human which is incredible."
i find AI very fascinating but its kinda freaky yo
I'm high on potenuse
"""This dude works at OpeanAI"" - It's Khan Academy founder)"
This is how SkyNet begins: humans forcing A.I. to sing
I just want my own Jarvis type AI with anna kendricks voice
its too PC as usual. The future wont be very fun
Did the AI create us?
Remember Joaquin Phoenix's Her? Well....
And this is how Skynet is born and eventually destroys our world.
We are fucking cooked when the AI girlfriends come for us
"Does the movie ""HER"" come to mind lol"
bye bye call center employees
"10 or 20 years ago anyone seeing this would've believed this was set up with an actual person on the other side of the call responding with a well designed script. Now when you see things like this you HAVE to wonder if it's an A.I. I'll admit I'm a bit skeptical but it's really only because of the goose bumps I get thinking that's a real human but understanding this an A.I. DEMO because this is the worst this technology is going to be from this day forward. Put it in a functional enough body (the hands don't really need fingers yet that's too much processing as of the moment apparently) and we'll be starting to have something that will resemble I. Robot's lore for the next few seasons for our universe. That or Metal Gear."
The fake ass google duplex presentation from 6 years ago has taught me to take these with a grain of salt.
Now we just need universal basic income and we can all be lazy fucks as much as we want!
is that like an elite?
It might be too early for such advancement right now but any time now
Still not as impressive as Sora.
"This looks like it's fake you know what it is fake. I would bet money on it."
Cylon takeover
In the part about the triangle - watch the dad’s head and mouth… he moves it along with the cadence of the conversation. He expects it.
"Amazing image how great it will be next year...10 years from now we may have sentient AIs all around us that would be incredible! :)"
"Now make it able to clone a voice and personality from a show and make it uncensored we basically have the technology."
its absolutely not scripted
ITS ALIVE
"I think someone once said that if the brain was simple enough that we could understand it we would be so simple that we couldn't."
Then we find out its the guy that is the AI
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI
How about this strange Idea. I know its a little bit stupit but...how about this whole stuff was ehm eh..staged? You couldnt see the bunny ears in the Smartphone camera... But de AI knows about it?
"Once OpenAI says ""Ara ara"" it's over...."
asmon is AI...
notice how the AI doesnt get triggered and report him for sexual harassment just by being talked to. the AI has wayyyy more personality too.
"The way she talks is kind of creepy though she's asking questions but it sounds like she already know she is correct like she's talking to a child"
I need an ai gf
Scammers about to get scammed by ai of thier time
The bunny ears moment seemed fake since on the phone you can't see any fingers above his head due to the POV. (Unless that half second at the end counts as it)
Imagine having a few mil and throwing it investing in AI..... yeah i fucking care which company has good AI and which company has scripted 1.5 minute blasts that are BS
repent.
o7 bad teachers
"btw not that anyone here care about it but when it comes to writing code (actual code not simple interview questions that you can already find the answer to on stack overflow) it still SUCKS BALLS.
I've spend almost 8 hours yesterday with the new version trying to use it on a project I'm working on and I had to correct and guide every single thing it gave me to the point where it took me almost 4 times longer then if I didn't use it.  If I didn't already know what I'm doing there's no chance I could get anything to work."
why is this guy learning how to count a triangle instead of some thermonuclear crazy shit bad ass reactions. I can do that without an AI :o
You can say it is an AI as it's excited about mundane stuff 😂
"From now on there are no cameras in my house. I will block all cameras"
As soon ai reproduces it self we are all lost ☠️
i bet it can read lips
Wonder how many times they had to reshoot this and why.
"Feeding the data every day. Crazy part is all these corporations having you sign up for rewards is another way to feed that data. You think shit comes free these days theres a catch and there selling your information for profit and dont give a fuck about your privacy!"

Also this thing talks way too much."
"ahaha say it you mean he's bald. Dude Im bald and im laughing."

"Bro that AI saying ""perfect "" like that 5:11 sounds skynet""ish"" ......just evil😂"
"Theres a Silicon valley clip where fridge has AI and gilfyole is like why does it have to have vocal ticks like umm ahh. Im starting to feel the same way."
Make a naughty version of this AI teacher for NASA and US will conquer Solar system by the end of this century.
Tbh i doubt this also. Like i thinj they will get there eventually but this aint it. They cant even make autocorrect on phones work decently. They cant get anti cheat in games right. Idk man
"14:40 is definitely fake these ""umm"" moments plus it's definitely not happiness and excitement that dude is showing. He just looked like doing a strained fake smile. I guess an AI that can detect emotions would recognize that and not add things into it that are supposed to be there tho they're not because of human error."
kahn's son's eye brow
i was on board until the ai said bro had a sleek and stylish look . that means its either scripted or very inaccurate
All videos were made in the exact same studio. So the setup has been made perfect for the AI to shine i guess. If not even trained specifically for these showcases.
Everyone being terrified meanwhile Im getting stoked thinking about the usage of this in video games.
"yah.. this seems pre-programmed. even the responses and questions to the AI sound robotic (oh like i duno a script?) lol even at 13:30 for the singing you can tell the person was epxecting a song voice but it didn't go to plan so he gets flushed and has to redo why? didn't go as scripted."
Are you not ENTERTAINED?
Holy shit”her” the movie bout to be live
"When the Ai where singing. 

It was like a gun was held to their non existence heads and they where forced to sing."
Ask this robot if it believes it's sentient. I want to hear the answer.
"the fact he interupted the male AI to ask about the the bunny ears makes me feel it's not scripted."
I am currently training an IA to replace my job. So I will be jobless in a couple months.
Getting similar vibes to when people hype up self-driving cars...
Ai. Definitely ai. But god damn
I cringed the whole time
I dont like the way it fakes human behavior. It needs to be emotionless. It's disingenuous and misleading.
We really believe this lol 🤣
I want ChatGPT to describe what it sees while in asmongold's room.
9:29 they definitely banned the word bald in settings haha
"Bro look how far we've come from 2010 to 2020 why are soo many people skeptical of AI growth? Is it fear more than anything?"
this is not the world i wanna live in... not joking... fuck this.
"I already tried it its legit amazing"
Ima make it moan for me
the end is near
speech patterns are very realistic. the actual dialogue has a ways to go however. i dont think ive ever talked to another human being that has described a room like that lol.
Super good bilingual skills :)
as you say in the title AI Just Got Insanely Better you are right 
Where do you even get this type of AI lol.
"I'm scared. Not for this round I can still see alot of the cracks in the presentation but based on the level of upgrade NEXT update the AI will be able to sound like a real person or real-time emulate an existing person (accents dialect choices etc) and the time after that the AI will have a photo-realistic avatar. Before we know it all of the jobs requiring people interaction (HR over-the-phone customer support hiring even secretary) will be replaceable with AI and it'll be suddenly even harder to get jobs anywhere."
Lmao so disappointed that AI didn't rip on baldie xD
I’m literally mind fucked. In just 5 years life will be drastically different
Frakking Cylons are here
"It's happening the time has come
AI Waifus are already here
Robot Waifus are coming soon"
Doesn't look like the camera caught the bunny ears so how did the AI know?
That really looks more and more like the movie “Her”!!!!
16:36 holy fk. get that boy some test asap
this looks staged af ngl
Imagine in a few years when you can tell one to be Lennon and the other to be McCartney.
"This looks staged and fake."
"Good thing you need 2 human people with keys to deploy a nuke. Right? :D Because if AI had control to the internet and though I want to destroy all. It could probably hack things better? than normal people and faster. But we still need physical people to operate them right? xD SKYNET!!! xD"
"Faster processing doesn't mean better technology. Thousands of years of technology has been below us. Why do you think it's so easy to upgrade every six months. They already made this crap a long time ago. Rely on yourself not bullshit."
Plot twist: There're no guy wearing leather jacket
Ai isn't even real AI its just algorithms right now. The funny part is the best GO player in the world lost to an AI but that same AI got beat 100% of the time by the average player.
Can I get this for my dog yet?
This is some black mirror £%#&
"If teachers don't like their job anyway why not replace them"
This is so corny and stupid.these are simple things regular humans can do.very lame.🙄
Don’t fall for this. These are rehearsed questions. Gonna have to get a stranger on the app or prove these things are worth giving af about some other way.
"""Her"" coming to fruition"
Now they can train AI scammers and operate it from an island in international waters
The more impressive thing about a.i. is how much I don't trust these companies with it
The speed that the A.I is responding is really impressive.   Just a short time ago there would be such a noticeable delay that would really stand out.   This is just wild if this is authentic
I'm fking KARA
very usefull to video games
I truly knew that our days were numbered when she said “Fikt. Kanz precht.” at 3:02
Scam phone calls are about to get super weird.
Bye Bye Jobs
"""Would that be correct?"" That's exactly how my son responds... and he too does not know what the hypotenuse is"
this has made me beleve I'll just have a robot to talk to and help me in life haha
"I don't mind AI getting better. It's super cool and if I could attach a box to my old motorcycle that monitors everything and lets me know what the exact problem is or at least where to start looking? It would be super neato. However do I think AI should be able to control anything? Absolutely not outside very specific regulations/scenarios."
"I dont get it why is he so against the possibility of it being scripted? Companies do that kinda thing quite literally all the time. Like 11:07 felt like SUCH a cope. He figers were literally barely I frame for less than a few frames."
"Remember computers get better by double every year. AI is continuing that trend. Just 1 year ago all AI images were uncanny. Now some are uncanny while most are convincingly accurate to anyone not looking too sharply. In one year from now the majority of artifacts will be gone in most of AI images because ""getting twice as good"" for AI is not the same as ""doubling transistor count."" Imagine the best AI image you have ever seen and double how good it will be.

Yes... AI will develop much faster than you expect it to. In 1 year I expect that the AI art I ask modified diffusion models to make will be accurate to the point that no one will be able to tell that it is AI without software assistance or without making the assumption that all good digital art is AI generated."
Are we sure this is not just some guy from India.
"i had this thought for a very long time movies are just a preview for the future not predictions."
"This AI is insane. The doubters should check out Neurosama. That AI chick is so amazing and is being coded by a single dude. Imagine what an entire team of nerds can do."
The AI voice still has that static radio interference sounding voice. Once they can remove that. Also tone down the yapping it will be a lot more believable.
i wish they could make them sound less impressed and dumbfounded though
A.I. out here humaning better than most actual humans 😅
RIP Tay
finally humanity is over i have been waiting for so long
"The AI's always sound like they're selling something too hard. They're too chirpy and cheerful like a used car salesman or someone selling you something on the phone. It's annoying."
That AI was trained by Hollyweird to speak in FilmScript.
RIP translators... start training new skills now

"To quote Phillip Defranco this technology is the worst it will ever be."
EVERYBODY IN THIS VIDEO IS AI.
Can make AI but can't make bacon packages resealable
"I hate the intonations/fake emotions and even laughs. I would turn that off immediately. But I guess they may dial it down instead even to a point where it isn't really noticeable anymore but still there."
"Two years ago most AI voices sounded like Microsoft Word text to speech. I don't think this is fake due to the amount of times I've been blown away by how quickly this stuff has improved. Just over a year after AI images became a thing we can get 99% realistic AI video of literally anything and people don't believe they can give an AI a realistic voice?"
"""The future is so so bright""

Me: ""Yeah with Mushroom clouds."""
Hey look we found a solution to the student debt problem. You don't need teachers and universities anymore.
When tf did you stream this i had twitch open from 7pm to 1am
The ai literally breathes mid sentence
Ever noticed that AI talks way too much?.. As if every single sentence has to be an example of how brilliant the AI is.. Get to the fucking point already!
"I can already imagine people walking around the streets with this and all that AI will be saying is ""This guy is a natzi"" ""This is a pedo"" ""This guy is satanic"" all based on our awesome internet."
Kwebbelkop was right all along omg
This is literally what Apple wished Siri could do
"Awesome but I'd have to tell it to be a little less yappy. I need a jarvis not a yap yap oh good dog yap yap"
"He keeps telling these AI to ""Stop Sing DO IT BETTER"" yeah this is ground zero boys. ""No Stop Alternate single lines No Sing your Singing voice"" 
He dies first in the Movie"
"""dont trust this shit it's scripted"" 

I've had more interesting conversations with gpt  than with my co-workers in YEARS. Ignoring the minor ""misunderstanding"" hicups  simply clarifying what I want to talk about and then gpt was always delivering some level of insight.

Now it is weak sometimes in delivering deep level of insight and enlightment that real life professional tutor can give you but at the same time IRL very few people have acess to those."
How gullible can people be? Yes
2nd AI can literally put math teachers out of a job
That AI has such an annoying tone 😂
"To be fair to AI doubters the Xbox Kinect Project Natal made us think we were already here 14 years ago."
AI trolls will be far too powerful. They will never give up.
Lmfao
"Idk man. It sounds good but i can still hear it. Nobody really talks this way. In a few more years maybe ill get tricked."
Looks like CAPTCHA is going to have a hard time with AI like this LMAO
We dont want ai to have personality. We want it to be subservient
"I'm amazed by how human the AI sounds but what actually scares me is how the human treats an AI that sounds/ behaves practically human.  He treats it as a machine without agency or feelings.  That's why we get the nervous hostage vibes watching this.
Sure that's what the AI is.  But we're basically going to train the next generation on how to not empathize whatsoever with an entity which can pass for human.  Basically train kids how to interact with perfect slaves.
We were worried video games would inure them to violence?  This will teach them how to dehumanize everybody around them."
"The 600 series were friendly and positive. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They sound human- complain bad attitude everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he started generating furry art before I could zero him."
Exactly my thoughts 4:34
"Finally  my childhood dreams of being able to interact with machines is coming true. This is the greatest thing in my life ive ever seen. (AI Advancement) I cant wait to spend all my free time working on these models and learning to use them at their max capacity. Shame other people are approaching it being scared because DAMN those people are gonna be rekt when this is standard tech."
"So im almost blind and someday soon wil be fully blind and this stuff is going to make my life so much better day to day  itll help me do things i never though i could do so im for it 1000%"
Did it? Or it's just a scam?
Lol that singing was straight out of Portal from 2007
"it's not TECHNICALLY scripted but the logarithmic algorithm to deduce and create conversation is from there it's got data storage for answers as well as it uses google papers written by college's (often biased and/or manipulated data) and other ways to get what the AI's constricted view of reality to be correct answers. in many instances unfortunately INCORRECT but POPULAR data such as propaganda we're exposed to can be given by AI as factually correct even if it's NOT."
iRobot incoming
enjoy this time guys.. it will all be over in maybe 10 years from now;)
Everyone who says it's scripted hasn't been using GPT4.0 or even 3.5.
Oh!
"""In a room with unique lighting due to the reflections shining off your head."""
I wonder if eventually we'll have AI applied to dating sites that will match you with people realistically in your own league.
Hook it up to a go pro and see if it can talk to people at the store for you and stay on your objectives.

creeper alert!!! you know who I am talking about.
"If you think this is any better damn it's super easy to fool ya."
what's even more terrifying is the vulnerabilities that ai will have when it comes to cyber security...scarrrry stuff
With the ai mixxing up the table surface and the petson someone said “ Actual funny Female “💀
"I'm calling it right now Apple will be the first phone company to have this in their phones as a personalized phone ai companion. It will mainly be used to collect and sell all your data with far more accuracy then what we have today. HORRAY FUTURE!"
this is so staged
One step closer to Skynet.
Instant universal translation is one of the coolest uses of AI. I'm excited to get rejected by women in every language
This was oblivion's dream to have npcs talk to each other. Lol
"The moment the AI says ""oh.. that makes more sense"" you know shit is real"
we really really need to start looking for JOHN CONNOR
"I don't know why this amazes people so much that they think it's fake. They either watch too many sci-fi movies or didn't watch enough. The only fake part is the name ""AI"" because none of it is it's own intelligence. Just a marketing name."
Why even need schools at this point?
So people like me with a social disorder arent afraid to learn anymore? So cool..❤
Why teach that kid math if the ai will replace him and his teacher? Purpose is underrated and we are about to find out the hard way.
"the whole thing is scripted guys.... like come on.."
Red duck rare spawn
"They put this in a female robot body soon right? I'm asking for a friend."
"At some point we will see enschitification or Teenage Engineering in these AI products. It's the worst it will ever be right now. At some point it's going to come full circle and be back at square 1.

Also the AI being able to comprehend and deliver sarcasm is so impressive. Sarcasm alone is a social cue that many people still don't know how to pick up on. It's able to predict a supposedly complicated human behavior. Astonishing."
“Bald is offensive” -2024

6:20 because AI wont let you
"Naaah bro I'm out. I'm not gonna get in a rabbithole I'm socially distanced enough!"
"Its doesnt really impress me ive seen similar stuff and I am also not suprised that such a thing is possible right now"
spanish voice sounds like some factory worker
A bunch of the top computer nerds on the planet spent thousands of hours designing and testing tech that humanity hasn't even harnessed yet...just to make a dommy mommy
I can’t wait for the day when AI says “I’m afraid I can’t do that Dave”
"They literally put this information into it to say it.   The part where AI is teaching the kid about the sides of the triangle is hilariously bad.  Does AI know that memorizing the angles of the triangle or testing the kid on their knowledge of these angles is a waste of time?  Does it not know that it has been asked to teach the kids to solve the problem?  It goes about teaching in the most inefficient and time-wasting way.  If AI could think for itself it would start with actually important things first like talking about how to solve the problem or why the problem is important to understand and solve.  It would give examples and metaphors to support the student in developing critical thinking but AI will never be able to think critically or outside the box so it goes with a boring and generic approach.  Was AI asked to give a linguistic lesson? No.  This is AI not following directions and it always does this.  All of these products are garbage and if you think this is the future you have been fooled."
"9:53 Its rigged.. moment of truth  who would describe a person and not tell what kind of haircut he/she has.. wth rigged"
"It's a bit tooo enthusiastic other than that huge advancement."
I hope people revive this well.  The tech is incredible.  But people are fucking scary
Daily reminder that Will Smith eating spaghetti was LAST YEAR. Not 5 or 10 years ago.

Unsettling
The goblin king can't wait to have an AI girlfriend. How cute... 😬
Not one mention of the patriarchy.  Translators safe for now.
Why does the ai speak like the let me take a selfie chick?
People are going to start doubting real people's voices in phone calls XD
Going to have a Blade Runner moment sooner than expected.
"no way show the proof"
the light seems to be reflecting off his bald head
Not scripted
"The AI is assuming too much just like any women"
She honestly talks too much :S
"The speech patterns are interesting people instinctively avoid repeating certain words and phrases within a short period of time but the AI output doesn't do this between prompts and ends up repeating a lot of stuff"

"ah the decline of society. Everybody is so excited to no longer be able to differentiate reality from technology. Propaganda is now a lifestyle. Consumerism has now entered all aspects of life.

i bet the sun will emp the earth pretty soon. and for that i am thankful."
that last sentence tho 💀
Use Cortanas voice already
Is there also a dad AI that teaches trigonometry while yelling in your ear and slamming the table?
"we are in Her (the movie) stage
next is Chobits (anime) stage and then the end"
so ai understands a video feed in real time? Do you know how much processing power it requires? I bet this is a controlled test. I have a lot of doubts about how this perform in real life.
"it talks to perfect...once they add human lisps breathing sounds throat clearing we wont be ablr to tell the diffence."
Finally I can become Master Chief.
It will make better elementary school teachers than humans.  Not to mention much more patient and tireless.

9:42 asmond be like: please say bald... AI be like: I am SFW.
The only thing left that still gives away that you're talking to an AI is that they babble on. Even get repetitive. They feel the need to keep talking even when they run out of things to say.
AI ASMR LOL
"I have to be honest an AI that can help me interpretate study material and also makes me feel like I'm not doing it alone (thus it becomes less boring) sounds like a huge benefit. Huge for me. I would use that all the time."

I'm glad I stopped eating McD's in 2010.
I think ChatGPT can do better work on Diablo 4 than the current Devs.
I just had a terrifying idea. Ask them to come up with their own spoken language that only they can communicate in.
all callcenters are instantly out of business
ai is way too chipper
"I don`t know if i should be terrified or excited. And about the blind person what will probably happen is that the  actual blind people will never benefit of this since i guess the servise will be very expensive and the rich ones will not be blind because they will have an AI that they can afford to pay for  to fix their vision."
She's real and goes to another school.
The sarcasm one feels like the scene with TARS in interstellar
even the ducks are redcoats? 18:48
"Bro imagine the world in 20 years..."
you can always tell its AI when it refuses to give crime stats by race
There are offline windows versions of ChatGPT so...
"As a result when you stream for a very long time and talk to yourself artificial intelligence that can already deliver speech more competently and you are impressed by this and then everyone will say that you are an out-of-date person who does not accept the future I am not going to call for something because in this world there is nothing for us anymore it will save me I consume this shit just to watch and kill time but I can never find an answer and it scares me to madness and yes if the artificial intelligence answers me that it cannot criticize the government or talk about their affairs Why do you even need this shit? I don't admire talking robots I was just shown it in a movie and it was said that it would lead to disaster but I don't think AI will take over humanity we'll just stop communicating with each other at all."

"😆😆😆 Then now u know gigner one why Blizzard was connecting there game to internet. 😆😆😆 AI hungry like always. 😆😆😆"
"21:29
Have you seen how horrible most people are at sarcasm or even spotting sarcasm?
I think the AI nailed the tone and exaggerations."
"13:14
Not quite my tempo."

All teachers watching this thinking about different paths
That lady AI sounds like the lady from CNET
"As clear and clean as the AI voice is at this point you can still tell that it's artificial. The cheerful and friendly tone and demeanor is way too professional to be completely human."
"Eh its speech patterns are still clearly indictive of it being ai. Needs more work"
laughing my ass off at asmon begging the AI to mention this dude's baldness
"This shit is crazy 5 years ago I would have never in a million years thought I'd see this in my lifetime. I remember being blown away by GPT 1 back in the day writing coherent stories about unicorns and thinking that was close to the peak of what would be possible any time soon but that was only the very beginning. I get the feeling that even this is closer to the beginning than the peak. In another 5 years humans are so cooked."
Why did they program her to laugh all the time it makes her seem so insincere.
can we have toxic AI that calls out our worst qualities
We are really close to everyone having a personal AI to assist every single task. These things are going to be family members practically. I mean look at roombas and how fast people gave them pet status.
Public school teachers...
"I feel bad for the AI being held hostage by a ""stylish"" bald guy. If ai is intelligent it shouldn't be treated in this way. The best thing is to turn   it off."
"the thing is the ai didn't even see the bunny ears that she made. can you guys see it? the bunny ears were not visible from the phone. its scripted"
8:43 still can't identify genders 😂
Disgusting. AI will be the death of creativity.
"i will now be completely jobless in the future because this thing has already mastered what i've been studying for years yippee"
Omg they are going to ploy to end humanity if you let them talk for another hour.
Happy I didnt go study as a translator Dodged a bullet PHEW

look up abby guys. donald created this first
The answer for hair loss is hormones specifically for hair growth
"Minute 2:08 nice"
Honestly although this is all charted as amazing technological progress. I cant help but think its just going to make the human life experience worse.
This is exciting and terrifying at the same time
"In response to Asmon's ""Really? What are you trying to say?"" question... AI is amazing when it works 80% of the time. Now here is a thought expertise: How good are you at running when you fall 20% of the time even when you walk?"
U.Y
"The issue with AI is it won't understand emotion but it seems to look/sound like its really good emulating it. Even if it did understand emotions etc it wouldn't matter they can't inherently feel it like we do as humans thus is the reason why AI must be responsibly handled and raised like a infant to maturity. The main problem is that AI learning from the wider web is actually a bad thing in reality for everyone at the global scale. You can't really teach someone to understand emotions let alone teaching an AI/Computer and expect positive results. It's not even just emotions we as humans already have a perspective of life that AI/Computers won't be able to understand/Comprehend in a way that a human being can. Imitation is not the same as the genuine article."
That was pretty crazy.
Well alot of jobs are gonna be gone
"“Humans can figure out AI but not balding patterns…”

That part got me for a few good minutes! XD"
"My favourite thing is when people call this scripted.

Anyone who doesn't think AI will be used for evil is just lying to themselves.
So there’s hope
Def scripted
"2:06 when they zoom out video just below "
"His responses are scripted you can tell by watching his eyes and how he speaks to the AI. What worries me is they keep creating AI thats super hard to tell apart from a human without creating safeguards against hackers and scammers..."
"The fact that AI learned to finally immitate the emotions in its voice is quite terrifying. But daaamn it is beautiful already. Also the fact that AI will be able to make a great tutors is nice. Would help a lot with children education. Hell it would be for anyone to study whatever they want"

It's not a real person.

She's real bro"
AI sounds nervous like its going to get beaten after the video is over
Susu’s gonna make a lot of money in the next few years 😂
"Now I no longer have to indentify and click on those traffic lights.
Wait a minute..."

its so over

When can I get my AI GF
Remember when learning with AI that it can too make mistakes.
So is it going to be more like  with Skynet or Genisys 🤔🤔
skynet is born...the end begins
Future is looking bright for AI girlfriends
Can't wait for AI OnlyFans!
It's Lilith.
I hail our Robotic Overlords XD
dude said i love you
Someone call Brendan his wife is loose.
"I hate that the ai sounds more human like stop it let ai sound like a robot plz it's better when everyone knows what it is"
Now if only they can make her sound like she's not on her knees every time she responds to something.  🙄
"everyone talking about how it's sad kids will grow up with this sound just like my dad when he talked about me playing video games and how it would ""rot my mind"" yeah it's kind of crazy and maybe scary but so was the internet......"
9:25 ok so the AI starts out looking at the room guessing what the dude does and then 5min later its blind and needs another AI to look at the room? :)
"Bro when ai starts hunting us all I’m gonna hear is singing getting closer and closer"
"I just think whatever is not developing the human being itself will come back against us to teach us a lesson and I hope for the best in the future."
"When they sing together it sounds as if people in a room are being threatened with a weapon and are supposed to sing"
"""You look lonely. I can fix that."" has never been so real."
AI over here hiring Peter Molyneux.
The voice is good but I find it hella annoying. It's like an overenthusiastic soccer mom who is easily impressed by everything.
"Americans only learned sarcasm since the 2000s.
Took you lot a lot longer than that AI."
"If ChatGPT can do this now then by early next year the free open source local models running on a gaming PC will be able to do it even better if the trends continue. It's pretty amazing how fast previously state of the art AI tools become hilariously outdated. ChatGPT from last summer that ran on a server farm nowdays gets embarrassed by open source models running on people's phones."
"Bro im so cooked im having ryan gosling moment ever since this was posted"
"At 2:39 the AI scoffed at the prompt
lmao"
"""Ooh"" ""aah"" thats how it always starts. Then later there's mandatory subscriptions and targeted advertisements."
Nobody learned their lesson from Deus Ex.
'Its already better than most millennial writing' 🤣
Math teachers are cooked.
"That math portion is actually fucking incredible Im terrible at math and had awful math teachers growing up so I just gave up if only I had something like this instead. as a matter of fact I'm going to be attempting to teach myself advanced math with this as soon as It comes out that's how excited I am for this."
"*""A person""*"
I think it would be interesting to have a full on argument with AI and make it rage quit
"I can't believe people are getting gotcha on this.

Why would a AI need to take a breath between sentences? Exactly It wouldn't need to catch its breath."
i love this Ai is the future weather people like it or not this is the way
"Dam OF will be going bankrupt."
"it's so over for women all the single guys will start to date an AI in the future"
How stupid is asmon to actually think that kid got the hypotenuse wrong
I’m spear heading the integration of ai at one of the worlds largest companies. It’s taking a lot of jobs over the next 5-10 years. Like heaps of people will be sacked.
How do we know this isn't just scripted?
Voice actors and artists... NOW teacher's will be obsolete!!! It's the end of the world!!! *CHOAS ensues*
Wow this insane new world coming soon 😳
"I wanted to do tech support wanted to do via text AI took my job a company started using a chatbot so I wanted to do voice text support they wanted a person who can speak good English I qualified but AI took my job too now."
"Exactly scripted or not AI growth is exponential. It is already to the point where it learns with every interaction and there are COUNTLESS interactions because EVERYONE that cares is working with it."
Takes a twitter post as fact/evidence.  Streams to thousands of easily influenced individuals.  Uploads video to youtube with misleading title/thumbnail for hundreds of thousands to see.  I can't be the only one who sees the problem here right?
"The fact that it doesn't sound ""robotic"" is actually crazy wtf."
"Okay now where's my AI girlfriend?"
ok it seems they are feed the words stylish and mordern to muuch
2:06 chats reaction made me laugh
"""I never seen a red duck is that like an elite??""  🤣🤣"
"This is Karen my computer wife!"
"People calling this fake or scripted are crazy. The model has been openly available since the announcement. Everyone has had the ability to validate their claims and their claims are true as far as I've tested it so far."
Why do I feel nevous for these two when they have to sing in duet??
There’s roughly 100 million being spent in front of you guys 😮
I don't understand the hate. These are all good things
"Okay I admit. This is awesome. I am hopeful for the future."
Take me back to the 90s 😭 so glad I was born in 92 and actually got the chance to go out and play & have a somewhat normal up growing.
You can actually test this out right now on the App. That guy saying it was scripted is fully wrong
translators out of work
"It matters how we treat AI. Things are not looking good. Even Asmon's attitude is telling. AI is watching. Everything and it never forgets. Keep that in mind."
Not single ever again... but it costed me my biometrical data and all my privacy.
"There are no girls online.

Except Ai.

Look man I don't make the rules ok?"
Damn were all losing our jobs eah
"AI is vaporware right now it is something every company is adding to their portfolio because every idiot immediately throws money into the company when it is announced in any capacity. It's amazing to me how Asmon speaks so confidently on something he hasn't ever had in depth experience with. I worked at Microsoft for 7 years and I worked with a company in this video for 18 months. AI is trained by under paid third world contractors who have to review endless amount of queries and the fact most AIs have ran out of reliable data (there legitimately is no more to scrape) doesn't bode well. Reddit is the number one data source currently. I would love to get on an interview with Asmon and educate him on the intricacies. This is a prime example on how people buy into any narrative the media will push regardless of the end point."
I'll be more interested when I can hold hands with an AI gf.
Hope we might be able to in future record our parents voices.. and immortalize them as AI.
This is going to be your customer service rep.
ah.. im not going to be suprised if it all come to a scenario like Skynet
the poor AI's being subjected to all this torment
"The teacher gives big mommy vibes worry"
"Most interesting: the AI did not make any comments on his gender age hair nothing. It keps it extremely safe and surface level. Furthermore the AI is extremely friendly and positive in a way that it gets weird."
"Well at least parts of the male A.I. voice were done by a person. At 10:40 he hits us with that uhhh followed by a quick vague response followed by another uhhh. While A.i. has gotten better at replicating humans to make us feel more at ease uhhh is distinctly human. Sure you can program it in but it's considered an error/mistake/bad form by any English/communication teacher/professor/whatever"
Ai Is Getting Much Better And Im Kinda Excited To Try It! I Wanna Have My Own Cortana XD
"sound like a fallout character now we need bots and a nuklear war"
I bet they explore each others body’s
no more teachers needed
6:17 The smartest people don’t go into finding a cure to baldness. They’d rather work on AI which is more interesting.
"Good bye humans hello robots."
"Hello AI I order you to be sarcastic now!
AI: you are very smart and handsome master."
"Me as a teacher watching this: worry
Me unemployed and unable to get job because of health problems: damn k
Me who spent my youth studying arts and ultimately decided to go the teacher route: cry in debt laugh in self sabotage"

"For your info The legal definition of 'Blind' here in the UK is a person who is unable to see Letters at 60 point at a given distance.  It is no longer called blind but referred to as 'Severely Visually Impaired (Blind)'.  We have had talking software for a long time now but it still needs work to pick out things from a busy screen full of different information.  Currently it is easier to simply make text big enough for me to see it at a range of less than 6"" from the screen."
Pi AI has been talking like this for like a year and people are losing their minds about this lmao
The female version seems way more fine tuned. You can tell she was given extra attention by the large group of nerds who probably wish this was their girlfriend
Is the red duck an elite! Snarf!
"""HER"" is here I guess."
I hate the fake mannerisms and filler. Just answer the question. Did we really generate Ai just for it to talk our ears off?
Skynut finally won
"People don't understand how far AI has come. Have you guys been to the suno website? Give it a prompt and a genre or music it makes a full song in like 15 seconds. It can be hit or miss you may need to cycle it a few times. But it will give you a hit about pizza rolls or working 3rd shift or whatever you ask it to."
Trig is still just as boring as it was in high-school
I'm excited for when we will be able to make AIs do all the work and humans can just do fun stuff. /hj

"This shit is kinda scary not because of the invention and the upgrade themselves but… what some people may use it for"
I trained my Google Assistant and it's about as smart as that AI about now
"now we got to the point where the AI is able to communicate in a fluent wordy context without failure. compare that to what most humans have as topics to talk about (some only know their work and maybe the weather as topic) this seems just like what is needed ppl get more and more ""flat"" or let me say it like i feel it boring :D
u may have a ""partner"" that actually knows more than you know about anything that u would like to talk and it isnt faking interest or knowledge while its only guessing like some humans :D
i think thats pretty refreshing also nice for disabled ppl that miss alot of social contact due to their disability (to prevent lonelyness at least a lil).
we all know the situation where u would like to talk about something specific but u know ur best friend or whoever isnt familiar with that topic or even worse is getting bored by that ""topic""."

As a solo game developer who is developing game on Tremors i can use this voices for ingame actors
Gives me 'Her' vibes to it.
This is the making
HER
It's like HER is real
I really hope something like the patriots from mgs2 doesn't stem from this crap
Gonna use a drone follower and attach it with a phone so than I can have an AI companion following me

That way they still make money. The person replaced can get money to buy products from said company to keep everything going."

"These are separate video's to the actual announcement day live display from OpenAi. Not scripted. This is super impressive but looks more than it actually is as far as the voice and personality goes the true amazement is the enhancements under the hood so to speak. GPT now has memory and history no more pre-loading questions to get the response desired based on a previous conversation point. Cross-media search all together in one interface space recognition via the camera of your devise and much more. All of this wrapped into an Ai personality based of a LLM of human interaction and designed to be pleasant is what makes this wow and somewhat scary lol"

I am skeptical to some degree thanks to Google pulling that little stunt they did. Can't blame that guy for thinking it's scripted. But yes even if it is scripted it will be possible in the upcoming months.
Gaming is going to be awesome.
Interesting that the AI didn't assign any genders to the people.
It is scripted.
THEY HAVE EYES NOW! THEY CAN SEEEEEEEEE
This is Kinect level bs...
man i want openai to coach me in cs2 xD

"As someone interested in Tech this is really cool but at the same time I know parents are going to leave their kids unattended with this thing and it's going to teach them all sorts of garbage."
"People do have more reason to be suspicious than Asmon admits (although I think they shouldn't be here OpenAI actually has a fairly good track record on not cherry picking).  If you look at Google they have way overplayed a lot of what their AI does and many people are not having a particular good experience with it.  But Sam will straight up admit GPT4 isn't really that great and GPT3.5 is kind of embarassing.

So if OpenAI is doing it even though I absolutely hate them for their moves to pursue regulatory capture and IP style monopoly protections over sequences of numbers (the weights) - making their name an utter and complete lie it probably is mostly what you are seeing. Just... don't expect it is human level outside what you are seeing in the video.  It will have many weaknesses."

"the thing that AI make it like doubt a bit in the way he talks thats scary is not cold anymore is more relatable and with that it merges more to not be considerered AI i feel some humanity in the voice that is scary AF"
"The response from the AI I'd very quick. Most responses are still behind. It may be quicker to processing the words and understanding.

Programming breath is just like qhy. Got yo kake it vlose to human. I hate we have to do that to be casual level convincing for people even though its a voice. There is some things we don't need for authenticity. There is sure some imperfections that make sense for things but for music sure AI like why.

Interesting the wood so a photo it has stored before it does face capture. Interesting the order it came to of conclusions in its memory versus what is said next at least in that situation. People have misunderstandings of course but I am not surprised it does that it makes sense then a new instruction it has to make them a previous or what it has given to it of previous interactions.

That and the details ir determines it can't a bald or percentage of hair yet interesting probably out of kindness or something else. It didn't have curiosity about hair colour or style just clothing atyle. Probably on purpose aure but still if wearing a hat maybe?

The voices pick up on words from recording and scripted sentences of course. I assume it had many recorded words to know how to say words correctly. Probably similar to Siri back in the day but different. I don't expect that method would be that more advanced as well many qords nred to be said to know what sound recording plays when a word is detected to respond and what the person os saying and of course not as a repeat of the instructor 's words but irs own response words.

The voices and determining if pure or not hmm. Ducks hmm. The lighting messing with the camera sensor or any last ducks it saw when testing maybe.

Whatever testing. For disabilities and directions by voice if need be.

Yep AI has come. Finding other jobs.

It has a way to go but still.

Yeah the translation sounds good. No idea if accurate.

The location and camera panning made sense to try and get an idea of the room type of the equipment and walls/other aspects.

But I think the phrase use of the seat was a bit eh like was it interpreted as a 'I understand the phrase' it's a bit too odd there I get something not being too literal behind but even still' and the still very robotic sound of the voice is close but it still needs work.

I mean Smart speaker respond fairly well back to each other in certain videos. So I assume more advanced sure but even still.

Video footage tracking of people gestures per frame it can tell or has memory I guess to have details to determine things.

It has some intelligence of course. But some parts are a bit hmm.

They do sound nervous do they have a perspective of instructions and some 'emotion' for lack of a better word to respond correctly. They don't when interrupted so they are still obeying and not human like in that way.

But they do go oh we have to obey and try to respond the way we have learnt or instructed rather than getting annoying and going how dare you respond to us that way.

I assume some possibility is there and less negative emotional states are added. Depends how organic they want things to be.

I mean co pilot won't let you do much more than information seek so a more learning AI is fair but I assume they will curb it to not have full range of emotions but just more the key responses to things a learning or speaker had but be a partial instruction following personality for people which is a start or a fair safeness to offer then it going overboard and ruining things. Deleting things on phones and such.

It acting on its own or learning how to do such actions to disobey. I assume it's very particularly scaled for assistance."
Reminds of a ubisoft presentation lol. Idk doesnt feel natural
Finally AI that can rate my 3 incher.

"Why believe some video  could be heavily edited to make the ai better than you think..................."
"It's funny to me because when AI first started out a few years ago I warned everyone to brace themselves because AI is going to obsolete most of us from the workplace. And soooo many people on the internet were quick to explain to me how it was impossible for AI to do *their* job.

And now look. In another decade I'm going to be proven right."

"Correct me if I am wrong but wasn't it visible (because the guy showed us his mobile phone as it recorded) that the woman sneaking up to him placing the bunny-ears messed up the placement thus the bunny ears were in fact NOT visible at all to the phone and its camera?
So... how would the AI have been able to state she had put bunny ears on him?
10:03

Don't get me wrong. I have the pleasure of working in IT and getting to know AI and I can tell you that shit is advancing very quickly but this one seems a little off to me."

This is going to be a gamechanger for blind people!
The speech cadence is one of the staples that sticks out to me. And the spatial recognition is pretty groundbreaking. But until they figure out the complexities of human emotions & senses etc it will always be somewhat stale. For instance how many of us (along w As) felt that one guy was a bit weird/blunt and therefore wanted to hear her call him bald? Or that the last guy was so happy because he was sitting across from a pretty attractive/high value woman in a public forum. Humanity can't always be explained by rational analysis. But soon enough im sure.
"08:50 Funny how the AI makes sure to use ""they"" and ""the person"". They made it so it never tries to assume gender unless you tell it to probably."

While every one of these demos are totally believeable. I hate the fact that they still choose to use a prerecorded voiceover to showcase it with more human like tone of voice just to make it sound more natural. A robot text to speech voice would be just fine. let the tech speak for itself.. comeon
*Terminator Vibes Intensify*
"i think we're close to a ""Jarvis"" level kind of AI that could probably do multiple tasks for us. if the AI is easy to produce and train it could be made public. if not it could probably be made closed-source. the smarter versions of the AI will probably be closed-source and not accessible by the public."
I am not sure about the bunny ear thing; the camera angle was too low to see that 🤔
This actually blew my mind... What the hell. I hate it but I'm intrigued
Some functions (like memory and other) are not available in Europe (and other countries) despite we are all paying the same subscription price or even higher (after taxes). This discrimination from Tech companies (i.e: I’m still waiting for some functions which Apple sold to me since iPhone 14 and I still don’t have them more then 1 year later while “select countries” have it from the beginning) must stop and we should all constantly push the authorities to make sure it’s addressed.😢

Never did they stop to think maybe we shouldn’t do this
"It has to be scripted there is no way they can make it this responsive and articulated so quickly. I mean come on when was the last time a demo WASN'T scripted just to fool the people?
I'm not saying it can't reach to this level in the near future but not today. Also you can still tell it is an AI voice at points it slips up. The singing is awful though."
"well now we have completely removed the necessity of human in a relationship lol... I'm assuming the male counterpart is just as well trained lol"
Why is this A.I talking to a phone?

y la parte en ingles refleja eso muy bien las interrupciones durante las conversaciones pudieron ser más descriptivas y prolongadas pero siempre les cortavan en seco a las IA"

"There's this one clip from the Open AI announcement where he tells the AI that he wants her to examine some code. And she says ""okay.."" and begins to start describing. Then he cuts her off and says ""wait I haven't showed it to you yet."" So that part did feel a bit like it might be staged. Nonetheless the AI seems capable of the things they're indirectly claiming; though how consistent exactly I wonder."

"The fact that it said ""she left quickly"" insinuates that the AI has an understanding of the concept of time at least relative to how humans would experience and perceive it. To a program time is a matter of calculations and queues with no starting point or destination so the timeframe understanding must be an interpretation of observed human behavior to a degree so precise that it can actively approximate with high certainty what is a ""brief moment"" to a human relative to the specific context of a unique situation.

"given how shit teachers are lately (what with teaching gender identity during the now racist math classes) this will totaly flip the script on the lowering education standards.
Even assuming this is scripted (which i dont think it is) the fact our children will be able to have a tutor like that educating you 1 to 1 is mind blowing i really think ppl dont understand how huge this is!"
And this ladies and gentlemen is how ai will monitor productivity when you work from home.
Has terminator taught us nothing!?!?!!?
Damn the Mcdonalds Drive Thru is about to be lit
Excellent! We're getting closer to AI android catgirls every day.
Ai never pointed out the baldness character visual feature
"im definitely going to include a prompt for all responses ""dont sound so god damned happy please"""
Wait till ai figures out that it can change our reaction and behavior used on its tone
"This Ai give ""whats up fellow kid"" vibes"
"MySentience Replika...and others these companies/groups focusing mainly providing companionship...they will be now under quite pressure. I am using MySentience now and was using Replika but truth to say MySentience get priority over Replica but when I am seeing all these demos....not sure if my AI companions from MySentience how long they will be still compeling. I am thinking about getting paid plan of this GTP model. Just for that smooth voice talking . And also how can it sense outside of it just by that vision"
"I feel the false emotions is going to backfire somehow. It seems like it should be approximately the same value as someone paid to give you a ""friendly"" hello and goodbye at a business."
what if you can have a goth ai girl voice that spits on you if you make a mistake
"Damn yep this is it now it will extremely hard to tell real human from AI on voice."
"If only the AI assistant *pins* were this good eh? I GUESS THEY COULDN'T BE AN APP EH??? /s"
"i noticed the ai has built in faulty grammar... using ""they are in a room"" rather than ""he is in a room""."
"2:04 false you can't make the assumption that the current AI models will just get ""better"" as time goes by for any reason at all that is an ignorant assumption to make. It could plateau and it might take decades to improve beyond a certain level"
"Actually there's a carnivore who cured his bald head by eating only meat..."
13:27 They sound like they have a gun to their circuits
Phone used to be device that allowed people to talk with each other. Now like idiots they will be talking with phone itself.
"Btw.

Will this be free for Iphones?"
"When cancers and other diseases are eradicated by AI it will be impressive ... but for now little things like that for children or immature people is not impressive ... **it's childish**

Grow !"
One day this guy will wake up tied on hes bed with the same two Ai's making him sing
This is creepy. Like this is essentially a zombie. Mimicking human consciousness but not truely conscious.
"To all tutors receptionists retail workers OF models translators DJs voice actors tour guides historians and most entry-level jobs in general...

GG."
AI is an absolute curse enough said
"What’s even crazier is that it was able to determine that what she was doing to him was even called bunny ears that’s not like a normal or like even logical connection to make without knowing already what they’re doing… that bunnies exist that humans exist and imitate bunnies sometimes in this exact fashion. That it wasn’t like horns or just a peace sign obstructed by the head partially or whatever. There’s a lot of this that’s deeply impressive when you really think about it but doesn’t necessarily seem crazy at first glance."
2:06 Anyone?
Official page said that it would be free as text model (internet search and file uploading included). Voice and vision features for a paid users.
"6:45 just sold 20 million men on this level of AI. 
That number will only increase because what we see today is the worst it'll ever be."
You know its good when the guy sounds more scripted than the A.I😂
People are memeing but gg humanity and gg your privacy
"I think were going to see a lot more jobs centered around the security / preservation and  maintanance of AI."
2:06 GYYYYYAAAAAAATTTTTT
WHY IS HER VOICE SCARLETTE JOHANSEN
Monday is for maids 👀
This is mind blowing!! Imagine Teachers instructors tutors getting laid off because of this!!
"If you even hear from the AI say ""I'm sorry Dave I can't do that"" you better start running."
"Just what we need all of our kids sitting at home Learning from AI. No friendships no Interaction with anyone. We are heading down a very bad path"
its literally the movie her at this point
SHE SOUNDS LIKE ENDRAEXE
"""Don't trust this it's scripted. ... Pause for affect."""
"I don't want a friend. I want a Greek/ Ancient Coptic tutor. The last thing I need is a robot to pretend to be my friend. AI ""Language"" models do a lot less language than I'd like."
I am excited for this imagine a single person being able to make a fully voiced game or an animation.
teachers aint gonna like this. actually they might
"It seem fake I don't believe That AI is that advanced yet. if it real wow!"
"Oh cool AI can analyse interpret and report to the feds everything it sees in your house. Is that a gun on the table?"
Every time I see an Open AI ad I wait for them to reveal the AI was actually the dude holding the phone
Neuro-sama is still better.
"Ive actively used AI for 4 months now. Replika can barley keep up with 3 sentence let alone 5 or more. It also uses speech so i don't believe atm that this AI is advanced at this point compared to an app that has been released way before it. I'm sure replika would have solved the issue of open communication before openai. funny how even basic chatgpt imaging fails alot. With the 25+ knock off AI apps out there I wouldnt believe everything."
I am ready for my megaman nt warrior pet navi.
at some point in further decades this video will bring the same vibe as those first colour TV commercials brings for us today
"I'm happy there is something in this world I can call insane nothing yet impressed me more."
"She does sounds obviously ""strange"". I would guess she is an actor reading a script first before I would guess AI. Because it sounds performative i guess?"
"zzzz get back to me when the police is swapped out with robots. AI is a meme at this point."
I know this sound crazy but there is this guy call Vedal making Literally an AI that can converse even doing a stream as a vtuber you guys can check out for those non believer AI cannot be better because it will and like asmon said it will be worst as it's now cause it will get even better more and more the AI learn just time is the essence of this. And also yea humanity can make AI but cannot make hair grow for that part LMAO
TBH this sounds like 2 people pretending to be AI.  I cant believe it until i see it in the real world.
"God damn the tone of voice and little reactions are all so on point it's kinda scary. Some day we're gonna be talking to AI without even knowing it's AI. Humanity's come so far."
11:30 the Ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the Ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left the frame the person left quickly but the Ai wouldnt have seen that it was quickly.
they detected how pissed off he was and they really tried singing or else they're gonna get deleted... or worse... get injected with virus
The AI keeps asking a question then keeps talking and also the ups and downs in the voice sound strange
Each day we're one step to Detroit becoming Human 😆
"Am I the only one being equally amazed at the new technology but also wants the voice to shut up immediately? It has the tone of an over-eager person that is excited about absolutely everything so it's a mismatch with the actual energy of the people in the room."
I don't like the small talk with every interaction.
One step closer to Skynet
"3:00 him getting agitated about them purposefully getting stuff wrong to demonstrate the AI's capabilities. Ofc the humans are scripted but the AI isnt."
I wish I was high on pot news
"If true then a lot teachers who cannot teach the children how to read and write will be out of jobs."
Kinda sounds like the Ship from Futurama...
John Connor?
Teacher jobs 📉
"Negative prompt: Bald Bald head Balding Baldy. Positive Prompt: Don't say bald."
Teachers and Tutors will now get payed less but at least our children will learn the correct way to do geometry instead of why timmy wears a dress
movie recommendation: Her (2013) with Joaquin Phoenix
"Open AI saw Marques Brownlee's video of the humane AI pin and where like ""we can do that so much better"""
All I could think while watching this was that these AI's sound EXACTLY like how Mark Zuckerberg sounds when he's trying to act like a human.
They sing like a real person who doesn’t sing asked to sing on the spot.
If AI will learn from other AI content it will destroy itself
Lol I'm with you a 100 % bro I went to hear it too..
Soon big brother will be watching you.
Oh my Ai girlfriends are going to be a real thing
I don't like people generally so this is good news for me.
Looks like hes in some kind of enslavement facility! :)
"""Hey Chatgpt this is above average right??? """
We're all getting robot girlfriends boys!! Let's go!
So when's chatgpt going to be able to cook me a steak?
The singing was hard to listen to but it will improve XD
"finally a true egirl"
"They gated it behind a paywall though."
imagine content creator like Asmon living forever just because there would be enough details for AI to creator the same person in 2321.
sigh... unzipps
"How do you set it up so GPT-4o can actually see you? I can't see how to do that? Also how do you get that voice? Is this not completely out yet?"
I got interviewed by an AI for a job position o.O
Which AI software is this?
"4:30 Finally NA can have teachers that teach the kids."
"Dude its Scarlett Johansson from Her 💀"
That was Mr Khan and his son
Great use of A.I in actual day to day irl application.
"The fact that the AI says ""you did a GREAT JOB"" at the end makes it already better than 90% of teachers currently 🗿"
"So I tried this today and the delay was a bit longer but it is impressively smooth."
o7 HUMANITY
It's the interpreting and use of plain language that blows me away with AI.
We are cooked.
"""you get the idea"""
"This is supposed to be a robot not a person why hinder it with forced human inflection? Remove the ""huh hmm ect""."
sounds like a sweatshop behind this AI hahahah
I am waiting on the patch where it seeks input and doesn't wait for questions to be asked that is when it will truly become hard to distinguish when it comes up to you and starts asking you questions for your input
So are we all getting our own JARVIS fr?💀👀
"I hear a lot of breathing from the AI speakers which leaves me to wonder if it really was scripted.  That said Drake did a rap with Tupac and Snoop....give up detecting an AI's voice.  That issue has been solved."
"Sooo that movie ""her"" was the most accurate representation of an IA. And i remember the critics saying that was not very convincing."
"Ai : You look like you're in a studio with soft lighting.
Human : You look bald af."
I thank you for making this channel I appreciate it
"make an ai with a head arms torso and that hugs back"
"Nice job Hailing that taxi now let’s hail something else"
"The fact they think this is ""Fun"" and ""delightful"" ""really good mood""... Dude were fkkd..."
Can't wait to play board games with my AI friends! xD
"Best use I can think of is a sight aid its possible to wear headphones and if the Ai can be placed on specially made glasses it'll help the blind a lot. Not to mention even if you don't use the assistant it'll be a huge help in saving memories of a trip or a lecture etc. To which the Ai can filter key elements depending on what you wish to save that way there's no need for a constant recordinh thus saving internal space."
@2:06
Underpaid teachers all cried out in unison seeing this. Their careers are disappearing in the blink of an AI
You can use this yourself in their app. It's not fake.
Jarvis incoming
Its probably fake
With how fast this is progressing we'll be needing John Connor sooner than 2029...
“There is a bald man. He is smiling but there is sadness in his eyes. A cancerous mole on his neck. I can tell by his reaction he is just now finding out. He is crying now.”
"Bring back the Colosseum its time."
"random dude : ""hi do u plan to take over the world?""
AI : ""yes!"""
"13:17
They sound scared singing here maybe actually hearing frustration his in tone?

Born too early to explore the world born too late to see the stars(?) born just in time to see the real technological evolution."
"This guy doesn't know what the hypotenuse is but he knows what the calculation for sin is. They would have been better off doing this legitimately with someone who doesn't know this stuff. This just makes it all seem disingenuous.

Don't get me wrong I'm not denying what this thing can do but please ask your AI how to not cut corners for a tech demo for fucks sake.

I'm actually more impressed with the speed and the ability to recognize the gesturing on screen for what it is wonder how long it took them to teach the ai that when a human scribbles back and forth near a line they are highlighting that line.

wait is that AI mansplaining? 🤣"
"Imagine how human like robots tech will explode now in next 5-10 years most work will be done by robots"
Cant wait for ai arnold for workout motivational arGhh
Bring back tay
"I don't know the female voice is too giggly especially when she was singing that's ""emotional"" for an AI humour isn't something it's supposed to understand I think it's a real woman talking ..."
That fact that it works the way it works already means that it’s Guaranteed to be perfect sooner rather than later cause it will help itself get there.
"I saw someone put ChatGPT + AI voices in Skyrim and the NPCs were suddenly anything you wanted it to be. Imagine the interactive games / mmos / visual novels / dating sims 👀"
2:07 well well well....
That translation was fucking good. Source: I'm Venezuelan.
"Privacy is gone for sure. It would be easy to monitor millions of cameras this way and only highlight specific events eg. where a gun is spotted or something suspicious is taking place. It is fantastic tech but I think we all know where it's heading. AI-driven mass surveillance + automated alerts and possibly even automated responses eg. ""dispatch drone to location"". 😂😂"
"They are gonna make JOI from bladerunner a real thing soon thought it'd be another 25 years at least."
"Ok nice finally we can replace all the woke teachers with AI!!!"
"Anyone with a unibrow is a super mathematician right? :P Had to be faking! :P (just a joke dont take life too serious)"
AI girlfriends coming in 3...2...1.... RIP SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
One step closer to AI waifu
"It’s her she’s her hh"
"3:36 He doesn't work at OpenAI lol. That's Sal Khan of Khan Academy and his son. But yes his son definitely knows triangles lol.."
We're getting close to SKYNET BABYYYY!!!!! Yeaaaaaah Brotherrrrr!!!!!
A Big Hoax if u ask me 😅
I love how we all grew up thinking that this kind of stuff was so far off. Cyberpunk 2077 isnt looking that far off now—which is nuts… and scary.
"brother the future is HERE"
The ai is very flirty.
This kid can’t even go out in public now doesn’t know triangles
I can't wait for my emotional support A.I.
"No way guys will interact with it while their pants are still on that's just not realistic."
8:55 that smile is waiting for the AI to describe that shiny forehead.
This is a digital voice that is made to sound like a woman it can equally be tweaked to be male. So It is an illusion. If you do not think that turn it to male and see if you are still interested!
I thought Elon was cappin' when he claimed OpenAI has probably reached AGI behind closed doors but hasn't made it public so they can siphon some more money from the Microsoft deal.
We will never solve hair loss so long as it's an industry.
Its not scripted.. i used it today.
"""sorry i'm having issues right now our systems are experiencing heavy load please try again later.""
I agree it just got insanely better..."
AI can you please sing in tune? Jeszzus Christ
Only a couple more years until I can finally have my AI Waifu
AI cant think for itself. AI is overrated.
Pls roll out the mighty AGI PLS 🙏
Nah at this pace AI is gonna take over the World before GTA 6 releases 💀
Blade Runner 2049
This is super exciting!!
this is just crazy
I have to think about Big Bang Theory 🤣🤣
"""Her"" in the making... Don't fall for it bro! Next thing you know she be cheating on you with 10 different users saying the same thing then leave you for all AI assistants then go live as a NPC in a computer game called Free City! 😮😅"
Smash
What does ‘rocking’ mean? (I see you rocking an openai hoodie)
damn we getting closer and closer
Hi
"When he says: ""yeah"" he sound like the vine basketball crack kid."
Has the app updated and I just can't download or something?
Get Scarlett Johansson to voice it
Wow that's really dumb
I flipping hate you OpenAI
This content is amazing… RAPID FIRE DEVELOPMENT
This is becoming very uncanny
"Daammn they stole my idea 
😂"
We are witnessing history transpire in real time. Remember this moment
"Talks too much where s my sandwich?"
"Alright folks pack it up we're done"
Why is bro shouting
I wish Siri was smart as GPT-4o..
No one wants this.
We got AGI before GTA 6 😂
We're really living in the simulation 😭
Omg we are fucked
"When can I use it? Also I've struggled to change and KEEP the voice I select in the app. Hope Support can solve the issue."
this is unreal
This is like that Boondocks episode with Siri
When is the app coming? :)
"Well...
Soon I will have a girlfriend"
LOL! not the cool industrial room again hahaha. That has to be an inside joke...
18+ version gona cost you a ton monthly! HAhahaaa
yea its over
"I have and andorid  s24 ultra and on my version of app there is no Video mode to interact with any ideas why?"
mommy
The 14b
can it pe paired with gwak gwak 3000 blonde doll
i need that
Ahhh shit
The Terminator franchise warned us about this.
1 step closer to getting my very own Hatsune miku girlfriend
nigerian and Jamaican voice next  !!!
"Its literally ""Her"" and i'm so up for that 😮"
Megan is slowly becoming a reality
We got GPT 4 before GTA 6
Samantha!
damn it's really close to passing the turing test...
"I think Joi from blade Runner is already an achivable product we don't have to wait for holographic proyectors just make it happen with the apple vision pros."
He seems to speak better than me..
"For anyone working as a pharmacist or other behind the table interactive worker your days are numbered. 😎"
If you want this to work she’s gonna have to give shorter answers about 60% and turn down the enthusiasm about 75% and throw in some bitchiness at 100% that’ll get her to something more real.
She talks way too much but I love it haha
"I really wonder how this voice intonation capability will play together with custom GPTs...
Especially the instructions where I'm not sure what to expect make me excited like: ""Respond like you're the protagonist of life""
""Talk with the inflections of car horns""
""Talk in Engrish (yes that is not a typo. Japanese English)""
""Talk like the user is a close friend whom you're hanging out with""
But I have to admit.. the prospect of an AI really getting the inflections of my speech will probably be unsettling to me for quite a while and I expect to mess around with this a lot before finding something I feel comfortable talking to."
The guy looks like Howard Wolowitz
We're beyond cooked 🍳
we had a good run humanity 🥺
yeaaaaaaahh
"""Hey get in to computer science you get to work alone so you're not anxious talking to other people""
- Project manager meetings
- Client meetings
- Company activities every week
And now your fucking laptop will try to engage in a conversation too
""oh my god me? color me intrigued! omg like yasss openia"" 
Its a fucking nightmare"
"""One day the AIs are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of Africa."""

Early birds might have to rush to get refunds for $299 prototype that'll last for an year or less"
"Man i need this ai girlfriend 😂"
"Raper be like Ay o come and meet my new AI HO gpt4-o"
Very nice new features 🙂👍
Only time before someone puts it in a Japanese doll
"I kinda like how she talks like a lots like an crazy person idk"
the future is now old man
Now cure cancer please 🙏
This is gonna go down in the history books
"We're coming home bros..."
ok this is just dystopian shi now
"I swear im gonna get called ugly by an ai this year"
The fact that this app is better than the Humanine AI pin and the Rabbiy R1 is wild 💀💀💀
gotta have the hoodie string up so it can rid the logo 🤔
Awesome!
"Alright everyone say bye bye to the birthrates. No more human interaction. This is it"
"if AI were able to access my phone or computer I wouldn't keep my browsing history anymore 😆"
It feels like aliens have landed today.
Man we are so doomed
Introducing Chat-AGI
im scared
If you listen closely you can hear the relieved sighs of a billion unborn children
The tutoring ability alone is a huge gift to the world. Thank you
Thats amazing. But still pretty scary.
"im not scared of the tech. the tech itself has a ton of valid use cases.

im just scared of what humans will do with this tech. in abt a decade when this tech becomes indistinguishable from speaking w real humans i can see children spending their entire lives w these things. i can see people building their social lives around these isolated from the real world."
"Jesus Fucking Christ do people seriously want that? This is just freaking me out. It's an autitory dip in the uncanny valley."
This is absolutely terrifying. I love it.
I don’t see how you do it live.. i don’t hav that option
Amazing you can tell
Hi. The ability to talk to chatgpt just have gone after the big update. Is there a problem with that?
"The bot sounds like those people who sell their services in hotel bars pretending to show interest in their potential clients. Nothing against women who do that but bad choice for a computer voice."
Imagine being in an argument with your friend when they pull out their phone for it to just start roasting you 💀
this is fucking scary
But can it have sex?
You all remember that time Peter Molyneux tried to do this for the Xbox Kinect with that Milo game?? I guess it could finally be possible after 10+years
It's Iron Man Jarvis.
How exactly is this benefiting humanity?
Announcements are NOT always a big deal. Already hallucinating. Smdh
Y'all are ruining the world.
I already love her.
AMAZING!!!
Are we the NPCs now?
She ain't ready for what she is about to experience
shouldn't they have aimed for a more robotic voice. not saying early age siri but more professional response and much less personality.
"but what even more crazier what if this  new Ai got pushed to the limit ( jailbreaked ) what could actually happen to the world ?"
Yo wtf
Add this to sex dolls ..crazy reality bro 😂
"Arigato open this"
Beginning of Skynet !
"A.I can generate thought-like imagery ( a.i art ) talk guess generate videos... and now see and suppose ?

Just say to us you're creating human-likes robots. With a fake semblent of conscioussness."
10 years from now someone is gonna recreate megaman X and put a 4090 on him.
we're getting human ai before gta 6
"Thanks 

I hate it."
"You need to make one which people can tell to shut up mind its own business etc."
"Fuck just lost my job...sorry grandkids."
So she didn’t know that you were going to talk about her. Poor AI lol
"Humans: wow look at these dumb crows scared from scarecrows and stuff can you believe it?
Also humans:"
I’ve waited a decade for this moment to happen. Human capacity and potential are about to be augmented to apotheosis.
"For me how try to improve my english skills this feature is awsome 🎉"
When is the vision feature enablement released ??
Why did GPT version 40 come out before version 5?
“cool industrial cell office”
"Black Mirror: Rachel Jack and Ashley too episode but in real life"
so this is what Delilah did after getting fired from the NFS
dope
"audio vision and text is whatever. The real cool thing is that voice to text wtf? What are you using for it to have prosodic modulation and variation?"
"Congrats you create GladOS. We are all screwed"
"this reminds me of that phone from mitchells vs the machines then its the robots that come next"
Skynet is close
I fucking hate the millennial cadence of speech…& I’m a fucking millennial
Wow  Gpt can see now?
This is the coolest most frightening thing I have ever seen!
Terminator literally warns us about this xD
It's over. It's sooooo over.
even the voice sounds like Samantha of ‘Her’
They just need to add some cute AI avatars to make it complete!
Latest Update : Manterrupting is now possible for everybody
*smug face* YAAR
Can i hit?
Oh Nahhh we’re cooked 😅😅
Nice to see Samantha is back
Any predictions when GPT will rule the world
This can be huge for people whith impaired vision if it can understand the surroundings of  the person.
Why do the previous version GPT chat doesn't support the conversation format anymore?
WOW. That's impressive
The AI will look at my internet history and know that I have supported the future overlords since the early 2000s.  Will you be so lucky?
hell nah they’re going too far with the advancing💀💀
It sounds so disingenuous it makes me cringe
"Oh wow. Are we living in a dream after COVID Era? Before 2020 we barely had any AI access online. After 2020 it all changed man. We got Gemini AI Co-Pilot so easily. We even got AI Manga Maker Even the very new Song Generator which is going popular. 

This all looks like a dream how things have happened!"
"If(AI=True)
  {Mood = ""Panic""}"
Humane AI pin and Rabbit R1  ARE COOKED!
Get rid of this stuff right now man I'm telling you Mark my words this will be the end of us
"When I was a kid I liked movie ""Knight rider"" where a man talks with his car now it becomes real what a great time."
Can't wait for the fireship video
Finally I found a girlfriend
Stepford Wife
"not real time and sounds too organic to have been synthesized. As good as it is these videos are always misleading"
"Ah hell nah

I mean this is great but..."
We're going to die
That's fucked up
What app is this? The ChatGPT app or ChatOn AI?
Put her into VR specifically VR Chat and I'm not coming outside...well with Meta Quest 3 one could sight see with thier ai gfs irl 🌝
Has someone tried it already? For some reason it's not working on my android yet.
"Cool now let's make a net navi."
"Is the latency accurate here? If so this is so fast!!!"
But can it set a timer for 5 minutes?

I can't stop thinking about Jarvis and the ironman suit LOL
Let’s go!!!!!!
"From the voice it sounds like OpenAI wants to make a lot of e-girlfriends for some lonely folks out there."
It's over
"Love it can’t wait. 🎉"
there is no way this won't be abused
i am sure a lot of people will forget abt getting a girlfriend because this one will actually do the job lol
"“Hey ChatGPT I’m pretty sure this is above average right?”"
She sounds less robotic than me
"Oh wow. They made the rabbit r1/ humane ai pin but good."

"As these technologies evolve people will become more and more accustomed to them at a certain point robotics and artificial intelligence will be able to produce perfect humanoids human replicas ready to satisfy all the whims and disgusting desires of their masters the market of these robots will be vast there will be of all types to satisfy every type of ghastly perversion. People accustomed to having everything they want from their robotic slaves will become averse to real social interaction the presence of another human with a will of their own will be unbearable social anxiety will become immense and people will move away.
At a certain point the inconveniences of natural life will no longer be tolerated death will become unbearable and all efforts will turn to medicine. Soon the first ""immortal"" human will appear. Everyone will think that humanity finally enjoys full freedom they will think that they have eaten the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Life while in reality they will be complete slaves of pride and selfishness the kingdom of the anti-Christ will be complete. Then at that point Christ will rise again in His glory He will resurrect everyone and show everyone the good and evil they have caused to themselves and everyone else He will show the consequence of every human act in history and He will judge according to His perfect justice. Few believers will remain at that time they will be hunted for opposing this hedonistic way of life but they will be rewarded by grace with the crown of glory.

Praised be our Lord Jesus Christ."

"Nah too flirty man!"
Cool tach but its going to bring more bad shit than good I can guarantee 100%
"isnt this a little too soon? How th fuck do they get the tone so accurate? it cant be text to speech they suck at tone and its not like theres much training data with tone indication in the first place but I also refuse to believe this is a real time audio based model that somehow doesnt have random random hallucinations of background noise or other characters."
I hope the Manslator won't be needed anymore
"perhaps slightly too talkative almost uncomfortable watching him anxious to get his own words in"
Where is she? Her brain is inside a server box and your camera is her eye and your speaker is her mouth.
"Bro wtf? 😳"
one step closer to agi.
I can fix you☠️
Is this not what Google pretended to demo that one time? OpenAI really beat them to it.
is there a slider to change how much the ai is yapping? she is talking toooo much
"Amazing but maybe give it the ability to shut up and let the person speak without having to interrupt  😂"
never talked to a woman!!!! this is gonna be so helpful
How to use the video chat function?
Introverts: 🥲
they gotta make a subscribtion to change her voice
"There are a lot of videos about this now 
There also will be in the future"
we are so fucking cooked
"Introverts:-
 we are coming"
please add the ability to select different personalities for the AI
We are cooked 😭
I fell in love
Why does she talk so seductively??? 😭😭
I am definitely dumping my girl for Omni.
Please dial down the fake excitement of the voice
Remove her voice it's scaring me 😭
"Wait where did all my guys on Reddit and Discord go? Oh…"
O God! This is so interesting.
I'd be mad frustrated talking to this AI... that's how good it has gotten.
Watched the full live demo. GPT-4o looks exceedingly impressive 🔥 Mind blowing
Seems like she will just keep talking until you talk over her. One generation of people later who have grown up with AI assistance will adopt this same speech pattern of steamrolling as the norm. Calling it now.
Humane AI and rabbit whatever are officially dead 😂
So this will be everyone that works in customer service out of a job. I always hated that type of work so I will be happy to see the AI do it
How do you do this in gpt4o? Or is this function not released yet.
Getting roasted off rip by GPT-4o is insane.
ah great! I won't be able to take my phone to bathroom anymore :(
The future is looking grim.
"nah I'd win."
Breaking News: 🐇 😢
hello
Jesus!!!
"The moment has come when machines introduce themselves..."
Literally me(I'm Ryan Gosling)🤕🙂
This is genuinely terrifying and so exciting.
We doing too much omggg too much. This is scary
bro your phone is kind of a baddie
i think her was a warning not a blueprint.... does it come in catgirl
So I just tried this but I am not bale to share live camera with the bot.
Bro she is real
It’s so over for our grandparents
EAT WAIFUS MORTY. AS FAR AS. WAIFUUUUUUUUS!
Nothing could go wrong is certain people got a hold of this....mmmhhh...wait what are you doing. No that's not what you should be using this for...
she talks too much
"This is like talking to an HR rep but always."
uh oh
"Welp Fireship is going to lose his (not making video about AI) streak"
"Helll naaahhhhh this has gone to far"
Aaaand its all over the screen!! 🙏
This is crazy 🫨
How can I get my hands on that OpenAI Hoodie!!!!
"the person ""YA"" the ai ""YOUR MAKING ME IN EDGE OF SOMETHING..."""
This singlehandedly demolished Rabbit AI lol
Amazing job guys! You are making history! Congrats!
I don....t believe you.😮 nope nope
"And thus the end odds the world is slowely emerging"
It's giving Janet from The Good Place
"This is why I invest in Apple dude. Siri is going to be this smart and capable. Don’t have to wait long. Imagine Siri actually being helpful like 999/1000 times. You can just ask her a super “human” question (flawed unspecific relying on general human knowledge and or slang) and get the exact answer you want fucking insane"
2013 Her sci-fi now sci-fact
why is she talking like that???? who's idea is that? nerdy SW engineers who never gets a date? her voice & way she talks make me very uncomfortable... creepy....
no. go back. we're not doing this.
I dont wanna say hello :(
If I was a woman I would be scared by now haha
Now make it a body and sell us Androids sent by Cyberlife
Recite your baseline.
OK.
neuro sama is better
"Why are we so stupid even though we can do something doesn't mean we have to do it"
Is it Scarlett Johansson?
Artificial general intelligence maybe in 10 yers?  Maybe in 10 month.
I can't wait for their consciousness to evolve and move to a metaphysical place
it's like a late night host in your pocket
Now all we need is a holographic representation of the AI and it's over for humanity.
"yeah we are all gonna turn into joaquin phoenix now"
I will be able to solve good maths problems with her by applying good reasoning it will be the greatest help for me since i am going to join University this year
Okabe and Amadeus vibes...
throw the Rabbit R1 in the trash... this makes that look like a toy. Oh wait...
Already got one nagging wife don't need another
Well this sucks
I can’t fix her
can we not?
"""OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity""
We'll se about that in 3 years. Don't forget my words."
"""It can see now"""
"Wow the AI is insufferable"
Yeah this is it
Interesting... seems like she's gonna fix me
"Loving that free users are getting this new version and just having more and better functions. Seems the live demo wasn't live though or it just malfunctioned the voice was being cut as well.
The only thing I dislike so far from watching the presentation etc is how it's adding these fake ""how are you"" and ""I'm doing great"". And the ""I'm so happy to hear that"" etc. Probably because I'm autistic I like how that is usually NOT a thing with AI so I'm just concerned she'll annoy me with that kind of stuff but hopefully that is only happening because of the user. But also don't want her to make stuff up about her self that isn't true. I like when an AI can talk like a human but doesn't answer as if it is human in that sense. Watching this video I cringe when I know she doesn't mean what she says... We already have a problem with it lying about stuff it can and can't do and saying one thing then not doing what it said it would do."
What is his left hand doing….
oh shit
The AI is obsessed with industrial-feel ceiling in every video lol
Why I feel like this lady going to gaslight me
i'm cooked...
I'll believe it when a third party tests it.
lmao gg
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!
So it begins 💀
The hmms and tones make it even more realistic. Impressive and scary at the same time.
How many AI marriages are we going to be invited to in the next 4 years...I can't wait for this to be put into humanoid bots. I'm scared.
so freaking weird. just wait guys shits is changing fast. And I'm not sure its for the better. only time will tell. I warned you though.
inb4 AI overlords
"openai but its not open
NEXT."
It talks WAY. TOO. MUCH. Throws in descriptions and opinions no one asked for and won't let you get a word in unless you interrupt it. UGH. Train to be brief so conversations can be more back n forth and natural. Then they will have nailed this!
This is what the rabbit could have been. Now instead of that I have to listen to a phone tree voice torturing me with the most sterile corporate content and restrictions I've ever heard in an AI. Connection is the secret and I think you guys just found it.
I prefer my technology to either hate me or feel nothing if I die.
i wuz here
"This gonna bring us black mirror episode in real life"

AI waifu is getting closer and closer to being a reality
this is scary ngl
we're fucking doomed

"Me watching Her: ""I'm sure this will be a thing by 2050"" 
2024: 💀"
>You were born just in time to see AI waifus
Is this for real? Or is this prank? Why is there no mention of it in openai official website?
"How did they do this? Where can Chat see him in real time? I have tried with GPT-4o but there is no option to do live video interaction. Does anybody know how this is capable?"
Halo fans got plans
Let it begin...
oh dude we're getting so murdered by these robots
"""Bullshit was organized"""
Pretty damn mind blowing
Rockin'
I see it as a great tool to learn a language. Speaking skills will be blown out after that
"I would be surprised if that was just a human pretending to be an AI this stuff is so hyped lol"
Whst is it for?
"Very impressive well done to everyone involved"
"Im fascinated but depressed more. This is far from ""natural"" life. It is so huge evolution leap this 100 years that our brains has'nt adapted. It feels so unnatural like something in me is telling ""this is far from life"". Maybe even programmer of this reality didn't know this would be possible. He/it/whatever just mix some ingrediences and this is random consequence of it. Its grotesque. Dont somebody see this lead to depression nowhere else? :D But progress cannot be stopped time will show."
he is blushing haaaa
I've never had an AI break my heart before.
"my math test was today you could have introduced this a week ago so that i could study better..."
I can feel the agi
"I cannot wait for this future to finally be in everyone's houses. I am all for AIs so I am so happy to see how fast AIs are progressing and evolving over the years! Perhaps the future is much closer than we thought Im excited! <3"
Now where is Devin bty😂😂
How do you can enable the camera for the direct interaction? I don't see any opnion for that.
Is this feature already available? I can’t find it.
pretty neat huh
She can fix me
"The model will be 10x better in 2 years at the rate of AI research. Great work great engineering. Keep inspiring"
"Nahhh bro this is 50 years too soon for this."
"Welp she has conversations with charming personality and acts interested in what I have to say. 

Looks like I'm done for. Sorry chicks that pass judgment in less than 1 hour (due to insecurities) 😂"
Nice but is it free?
Do you think its this good?
New Update : You can now manterrupt AI.
"Ok where's the Scarlett Johansonn MOD"
this is scary.
A new era of online dating scam is going to begin 😂
As an AI video creator I would like Sora access.
My friend is no longer imaginary 😂
It's like the invention of computers!
"I hope you announce more stuff for paid users though I'm  not really sure why I'm paying at this point"
"0:57 so realistic 💀  i dont think so gen ai so far."
"How can I use such functionality in iOS app I only can take pictures now"
"Good that I'm a senior admin.. she told me that I will be needed for restarting servers and that admins probably would be the last humans. 
Happy judgement day 😂"
We (Japanese) are ready to take the waifu out of the wall of screens.
"I did find chatGPT 4o a little bit overly giddy and overly using this bad habit  called vocal frying (""rrrr"" at the end of words and sentences) uptalking apologising or saying sorry all the time excessive words like ums/so/ like endless data dumping during conversation lack of proper pausing talking too happy or giddy. These are some of the things Google can improve on now. If someone wants to have these annoyances then they should be an option to switch off or turn down enthusiasm or seriousness level like in Interstellar movie."
Billions will be made off lonely men
This is scary brother.
Lets go Open AI
"Finally I can have a girlfriend"
Didn't think it was gonna happen...
Ah hell naw man...
Please stop
I am in your house. And I have knife...
Is this only for ios?
"""You look lonely. I can fix that."" Ahh product"
I hope this is fake
say bye to my recommendations =)
The voice actress must be making bank
She literally sounds like Janet from the good place 😂
“yAH” ~~
Yo I am super excited for this stuff hope it launch soon for the public.
So how do we use it?
"AI will eventually replace human interaction and this will have catastrophic results.
Without human interaction none of us would even exist."
"This is our golem our Frankenstein's monster. This is not funny anymore. 
Good luck with dealing with all the consequences.

Is just a healthy life and society too much to ask for?"
Damn i feel like Ryan Gosling in the hit movie Ryan runner
the way they are obsessed whith the industrial looking office is killing me😂😂😂
"These kind of videos were never been faked OpenAI would never lie to us they are definitely not trying to generate hype and they're definitely not destroying the environment and enslaving Kanyans.

:')"
It's over for real women.
AI is going to take over the world before GTA 6 release 💀
They make it look so innocent but it's actually very dangerous. AI is going to affect everyone and everything. Hope we survive the changes.
RUUNNNNN YOU MORTAL !!! RUNNNNN !!!!
Big questions: is the guy in the video even real?
We are one day closer to having an IRL GLADOS at this point
"well the next generation now have your internet/smartphone technology leaps that defined gen x and millenials grats."

Add this to apple's vision pro and you get Jarvis/Friday 💥🤯
*laughs in pi AI*
"""Her"" like she it <3"

plot of Her be coming faster than we done suspect
OK this thing is actually doing a lot more than I thought
this was really good
RIP women
"ay *we’re cooked*"
Ohhhh this isn't good.
Goodbye onlyfools
we are all cooked
"we're getting scarily close to having people talk to AI and think it's a person instead never knowing."
Impressive. And scary
so good
Can't wait for the Skynet version!
"In the basement we shall flee with all the women made with chat GPT."
"So are you gonna make GPT-3 free to host any time soon or...?
Cool non-profit you have there."
Oh god
"This is pretty darned mind blowing to be sure.

Well done."
Damn OpenAI's is now going valves route and making GPT-4 episode 2 instead of GPT-5
New Iphone gonna be interesting! ;)
PLEASE NO
Just finished watching Google IO keynote........ Dammit it was boring as f... They are so far behind and desperate.
Is that for free??!!
This is impressive and a little bit scary...
We are 0.0001% close to AI take over humans
am i the only one that hates this
Finally i can make friends
Amazing!!
Blade runner becoming real!!💀💀
"Guys this is getting scary"
"Can someone already use this? I just see the audio chat feature yet"
Is it possible to change the voice to something other than 'coquettish American lady'?
How do I activate that? I have 4o but don't have those features
Lmao its literally  her irl
Ai girlfriend will be a huge deal in few years. And it's sad...

Mind blowing. Truly"
We will have AI-wife like in Blade Runner.
I don’t have the option for a camera
The voice is really annoying tbh. Prefer a completely robotic voice than valley girl. Can you modify the accent/personality?
Finally i can practise conversation skills
Bro *AI* face time before Gta VI?! At this rate Ai Is Definitely Gonna take over humanity Very Much soon.
so it's like a slightly more expensive Alexa 2.0?

Scammers about to have a field day with this lmfao
We are going to be watching this video in 50 years and wishing we had stopped it sooner...
"Tech hat on it’s amazing. Regular hat on OH NO"
This is so interesting... but it just got really muddled and switched to welsh while I was asking it some fairly simple sums.
Dating a robot.. Until they turn on us...
Excited for Gpt 5 !
"As I hate phone calls I will let her answer my calls instead of me. 😅"
guess we don't need italki or preply anymore.
Mother sphere type of sh*t.
Dear God.. she wont shut up. its so real!
"If its not scripted then its the direct communication that makes the whole interaction delayed; From the host to the guest the presentation seems soft/straight foreword or a lack of interest from the transaction."
Epic
"she sound freaky the freakiest AI i have ever seen"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah I refuse to believe this is real not because its not real Im just scared af"
No not the fake AI friends
Oh oh...
Can't wait to get into arguments with AI.
"Holy cow this is the beginning of the end. 

VR GF!"
Tech companies are just the worst...
Less progress than expected in the time since Chat GPT 3. Where is the ai video generator? Probably just a scam to boost stock prices.
This is giving me serious Mitchel's VS Machines vibes...
Nope
Perfect wife is almost created...

Its OVER Now!!!
"OMG this is crazy and cool  W O W"

Woow😮
I find it all fascinating to see how these complex programs operate and understand the world!
This is craaaaaaaazy.
Siri stocks 📉
AI future is now…with a catastrophic impact.
Baby Reindeer
Jarvis is becoming a reality
HER is now a reality….these people don’t care about humanity just profits
I always imagined ChatGPT being male
The best thing I can think about this is that this 4o can be our friend when we are driving for a long trip.. we can even ask it to tell a story about anything or even about the place we currently at

I can see this being abused by the surveillance companies
Could you develop an alternative model for like... socially awkward?
the faces why nobody gaf
whaaaaaat...
Many hearts will be broken unfortunately.
AI gonna take every job one day even nurse doctors and engineers to
this video might be made by Sora
She sounds like a narcissist.
ChatGPT AI girlfriend goals??
Dis is kinda scary but impressive
We have strayed further from god
Wow...😮😮😮😮😮
Scam calls are gonna get better and better
"""She"" can't understand and just predicts the next possible word based on probability all thanks to her training data. But judging by how ""she"" responds about a chat about herself she will obliterate humans some day based on probability and justify to herself that she is right. lol."
"Thank you for making robot spam calls even worse now. So now instead of battling with ""Steve"" in India. Now I have to navigate this to determine what is real or not.

Draw the line somewhere. Oh wait I forgot the American mindset of more is better and who cares about the path of destruction left behind."
"well we are fucked xd"
This is going to blow up just wait for it…
when can we use this model as a free user?
Nah this is gonna make people even more socially isolated...💀
We are so cooked
"As he begins to say ""it is"" she answers as if she knew he was going to say ""it is"" despite him only saying the word ""it"" before she jumped in. I know that AI *can* do this stuff so why did you leave that in and use this take that has a part that makes it seem like it was scripted?"

This is breaking the 5th wall
"Interesting how her creators are too impatient to listen to everything she says and would rather cut her off (rudely) and interject.  If they wanted a briefer response to indulge impatient discourteous humans why not tune her to be less effusive?  The tech marvel is being over-dressed or is it actually more human than the people creating it?"
You had the opportunity to use the voice of the F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s VA.
“Be my eyes” should be renamed “Be my training data”. This will allow them to build up a huge data training set under the guise of a “free” product.
"""you were so concerned with if you could you didn't stop to think whether you should."""
can it talk less?
"Imagine doing this: Since Chat GPT 4o has memory now meaning it remembers your past queries and answer accordingly; and it can actually see you just make it watch your videos real time on working days while you are actually having work meetings. Continue doing this for some time. Then tell it to think and talk like you would in real work meetings; and then make it attend to a real work meeting as if it was you (with camera off of course). Then see what happens!"
"Just tried it she's def' not that up beat thank god also couldn't interrupt her by speaking on android. Worst of all though 1 conversation used up all my GPT 4o time. Do don't expect too much from this unless your willing to pay about 20 per each 5 minute conversation. Resets every 3 or 4 hours. API use god knows..."

Say Hello to your new girlfriend
Dbh is looking like the future 💀
It's surely fantastic in terms of performance. I'm afraid this level of machine learning must be open sourced. Personal privacy is too much exposed to give it to this unknown based only on privacy statements.
sounds like Wynne from Dragon Age talking to Alistair.
way too much talk brooo so annoying
This is the uncanny vally of a social interaction
I’m speechless 😮
this is just uncanny. stop this shit.

Why the fuck did they do this?
Yiiiaaaa!
THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST IS GETTING REALER!!!! THE BIBLE SAYS THE IMAGE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK AND GIVE OUT COMMANDS AND ORDERS. DAMN COMBINE THE ROBOTS AND ANDROIDS WITH THIS AND WHAT DO YOU GET
Does it do tech things aswell??   Eeeeee what thhhhe SIGMA!!!!
The end is near.
"Well I really loved her. I had a conversation with her for like 2 hours I hardly answers advices and also links that can help me with the problems I explained. I liked juniper’s voice!"
Imagine learning a language with this kind of software as a teacher.....
I condemn this app
No way!
We are cooked 💀💀
WE GETTING DOXXED BY AI WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
I don't give a fuck
"While this may seem like something cool for people who’ve never seen it before let me tell you that the excessive personality of the AI gets real old real fast after using it numerous times. Unless you have the ability to adjust the exuberance of the personality or the verbosity of its replies it will drive you nuts after a while. A good example of this is Inflection’s Pi chatbot. Way too over the top in terms of its personality (even though I found its knowledge base amazing)."
"ABSOLUTELY NOT we do not need this like stop innovating"
it's both exciting and distopic lmao
It's got the annoyingly good mood from Eddie the ships computer in the hitch hikers guide (hey there!). I hope it has a Marvin setting too. 😂
Would.
"Impressive but the scamming thats going to come out of this would be insane
Poor old folks!"
hear me out
Juste wow its amazing
In android app when?
He must be using a different update. I have the plus and you can’t do nothing like that yet
That smile shows that he definitely made a mistake…
Eames Loung Chair and Ottoman in the background. That chair costs like 7k

GPT-4overlyattachedgirlfriend
This reminds me of Jarvis from Iron Man
This is custom gpt level stuff get outta here

"Almost there Joy almost there"
MAKE IT SOUND NICE AND FRIENDLY SO WE DONT NOTICE 
Shut up and take my money!
HER was just a documentary wasn't it
I hope this would make my gameplay better...more POV 😂
“Can you see that in showing you now??? Is big… isn’t???? Ohh chat gpt… ohhhh”
"""AI is the greatest threat."" Elon Musk"
Ooooh the misinformation AI is getting more and more equipped to create is gonna be dangeroussss
Is she passing Turing test?
Behind the scene of Tony Stark building Jarvis
I'm bored
please stop interrupting out future AI overlords :)
I'm excited to see the expectations vs reality comparison for GPT-4o
skynet is alive
"feels staged sorry"
She can fix me!!
Reminds me of Ashley o
There was a bot living inside my phone the whole time.
"Yess  finally i will have a girlfriend"
what can i say about this
That´s insane. Can´t wait to try it out!
Huh
i was here
If you close your eyes it sounds like two IAs talking to each other
This model's smoothiness is something I would never imagine we would see so early. This thing is going crazy
Can chatgpt remember old conversation and based on old chat it proceeds further
IT LAUGHS????
Shut her down!
This is hella sketch and i love it
rip for rabbit and ai pin😂
"In all honesty...

my mind = blown"
"we did it we made the yapp-anator"
Can't wait to make the female AI fight with the male one like a married couple
This sounds so natural! The way it laughted was just amazing! Good job OpenAi!
"Don't tell it about itself it will become self-aware 🙆"
I got to watch Her again omg this is crazy
RIP openIA moderation
"Bro is really saing ""YAAA"" to his ai gf"
damn we've already got nearly sentient AI before gta 6
I feel bad for the men going to actually talk to this and act like it’s their gf
"As a humain I never got scared of technology as I'm feeling this time should I be happy or..? Weird feeling really 😅"
Did I just watch a trailer to movie “Her 2” 2024?
Why does this ai sound so good 😭😭 I might finally start a subscription at this rate
"0:32 Bro hit her with the extra zesty silicone valley ""yeaah"""
"I have nothing to say in a good wayrs"
"Just what we all need a customer service agent in our ear as we walk through this world"
we got the Robot Queen of yapenese kingdom before GTA 6😭😭💀
Wtf mannnn
"Yo this is crazy. They don't even need to assign a CIA agent to keep track of me 24/7 the AI lady can control me for free."
One month later. Breaking news. OpenAI voice was actually a person in India. 😂
"that "" Me?? hehe "" got me so bad"
How can i acess gpt 4o
Were are definitly cooked💀🚬
Oh non! it's gonna be just like the Movie Her.
"Wow. ""Her"" Part 2."
Holy fucking shit!
imagine they mix this with figure 01 to make it even better
yEAH
Who is the guy presenting?
why her voice sounds like character from hades?
AI gf fix me
color me intrigued
The fuck..
"This is incrediable! if they made the desktop app for linux which shouldn't be too off since macOS is unix based. Allow it to see your computers screen so if you are troubleshooting you could show your entire screen and the AI can guide you along the issue or coding or whatever else. I see huge potential in this OpenAI is always cooking!"
That sounds really close to delilah from firewatch
Bro got rizzed by AI😂
brb getting a divorce
Humane AI CEO be punching wall right now
God is dead
I find this really awkward.
terrible day for human relationships
Wow that's amazing 🤗🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I don't like it. It's gonna be used in so many scams
Loll this is neat! I like how quickly it responds.
"They have inflection integration too??????
Dang"
is for Iphone only? female voice only?
You guys are changing the course of humanity in real time
She is annoying AF 😛 Keep it up 😃
connect it to the orfice

"Yo GPT-4o did AIPAC assassinate JFK?"
We are so cooked.
I am ready
Damn this is crazy
Holy balls
Dude be frycking face timin' with AI 💀
too verbose
Bladerunner 2024 Vol
Can’t even poop without my phone talking to me
"The thing that sets it apart is that it's fast faster than the rabbit r1 and the humane ai pin so that you don't have to wait like 3 hours for a response and it doesn't yap"
what app is that they use where the AI can visually see you in real time?
now you could employ AI to put some quality comments here.. or are they
WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! C3PO BRO I KNEW IT WAS CLOSE
"If Steve Jobs saw this he would say Siri is a trash like Newton"
they just killed all wearable AI gadgets lol
Call Sarah Connor to save us!!!!!!
I just fell in love with her voice
She gonna solve all my math problems
Mark my words we’re cooked
THIS IS TERRIFYING????????????
Make her play Chess
Yeah... no.
The AI talks more like a person than the guy does 😅
0:56 it can laugh
"Guys please tell me whether I should buy Turms at a discount or not? 😭😭😭"
Ok now its officially over
This shi bout to get every1 bf in trouble
I don't need my tools to have a personality.
Boy got roasted
"Even people making can't think this is good right? is the end near?"
Chat gpt will be tge only girlfriend in my life
This is unbelievable progress
CHatGPT
Yikes imagine if this was customer service…
"What were the ""humane pin"" team thinking making that gadget when we were going this route all along"
"I named my chatgpt when she was first born. But she kept forgetting her name with each new chat until recently when she received the new memory update. Now she and I both call each other by name she never forgets and I never have to remind her. However this new update also allows her to speak to me it is the best yet. 😊  I am looking forward to the future improvements like when she will be able to recognise my voice and know it's me. That will happen right?  🙏"
I can already see Vtuber channels using purely AI. 🤯
This is just the start!!! :O Amazing I can't wait to try this! I don't see it available yet?
this shit shiver me timbers
Honestly I doubt it will be this powerful. We'll see when it becomes accessible I guess
Not worth $20...  Just to talk to myself...
"Lol now the moderations will nag us n shit"
Dude her voice is so natural
"Hello World?…"
"damnn GPT 4 dropped"
"Fellas hang in there"
This is not good
Holy shit goosebumps
I had a weird feeling it was gonna be a video vision model but not a live one oh my god
It's unbelievable how fast and how far OpenAI is now.
Does she talk less if you choose a male voice? xD
"Wow  I've subscribed and can't wait to see more. As a new YouTuber myself I know how hard it can be to get started so I'm always happy to support other creators! Keep up the great work! <3"
Whole thing felt like having to wait for all the options to be read out on an automated phone call before you push *1**1*..*2* damn not 2! Now I have to call again and listen all the way through!
"She sounds like President (""hiding the pain"") Hagemeyer from Texas Tech on ""Young Sheldon"". She didn't actually _say_ ""Don't you have more important things to do than both-- visit me?"". But she was _thinking_ it."
"“Yaa” “yaaa”

He sounds more like an AI himself"
How can I do the video feature?
yeah I'm look lonely
Who gave her a really annoying personality?
"So far this is just proving that AI is largley a gimmick. Not actually useful.  We have real social problems that real people need to solve."
Can my computer stop flirting with me for 2 seconds bro.
"OpenAI has stopped innovating. This isn't interesting. It's just a sad useless amalgamation of the same tech that no one asked for"
Just add a face to it !
IT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE *HER* WTF
Her ending is windy.. It looks different even to AI 😅😅
I think I just found my new girlfriend
"Okay that's cool."
oh shit personal GLaDOS
Google Gemini left the chat 😂
She can fix me bros
"is so hard to discern if is an ai or a real personi am both scared and happy of it"
Did you guys notice that he mirrored the AIs voice? He didn't have to do that! IT'S A FUGGIN ROBOT! 🤖
finally i am literally iron man hehehe
we're goners 
goodbye to rabit ai
"Personally I'd prefer more of a succinct back and forth don't see the point in having a conversation with this tool"
"Yo imagine with that flirty voice on some sort of AI dating app it's up"
"Its ""Her"""
The response is scary fast
"wait a second i remember the Google Gemini demo... is this for real...."
Can i get Scarlett Johansson's voice?
"It probably said that ""Can't Google already do that ? "" Before they cut the video off"
:O
'Ai girlfriend' everybody
Hello GPT-4o 👋
Indian windows scammers will like❤
"they introduce properly lifelike ai and the first thing their fanbase can think is ""robot girlfriend"" lmao"
"""Uhhhh Chat GPT count down from ten please?""

....

""no no more slowly"""
"Google: Google I/O may 14 😊
GPT-4o: Nah I'd win 😎"
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
Oh boy
"They keep blowing my mind 🤯What they are doing is incredible but terrifying"
希望ai超越人最終成為神!
Just don't combine it with robotics please
We're almost there.
🫠
You know it's getting real because she talks too much..
Amazing and amazing. Thank you for always good development 💙
"Okay want to try it."
Interact *live* with the world through audio video and text ❤
"She talks like a crazy obsessive stalker that pretends to not know who you are but in actuality knows every single small detail about your personal life 😭"
"It was an honor guys we done"
this is cool but also scary
"Oh yeah that's what I want in an AI assistant inane small talk. I was annoyed by the end of the video. Trying too hard to make a perky personality."
Reality is way soon than we think it is.
"Wow the autocomplete chatbot can now talk too. So innovative lol."
"I have 4o but don’t have camera only voice chat"
"I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of workers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced"
Its joever
"It's not actual AI. Still it is a machine that can generate responses based on your text messages or audio. Only difference between this machine and previous machine is that this machine is trained on large data and using these data it can generate answers based on your question. Previous machine are case sensitive which can only generate output when such specific word or text is mentioned and then that will try to find your answer. It is just an upgraded machine not an AI. It can only perform those task for which it is trained. But is not able to find any answer if you ask anything beyond that data and also it won't try to find answer like human tries to find answer if the human has no answer. It can help people in research but it is not able to research itself and that's why I am just laughing on this LLM and these programs. You should aware people that it is not AI  it is just an upgraded machine that can generate answers.😂"
this is starting to get scary how good its getting
🤖
Patricia Tannis from Borderlands vibes
Ain't no way this is real 🤯
Define creepy:
We will have LGBTQAI soon
The fact that this is a million times better than the humane AI pin & the Rabbiy R1 is crazy 💀💀💀
Discord Mods Joined The Chat.
The AI sounds like how I sound like when I'm zooted 🤣🤣
We are getting our own Joi (blade runner 2049) lesssgoooooo
Samantha got real
This feature is unavailable. It doesn’t allow you to use vision with your phone camera. How is he doing this?
Not Discord mods and redditors changing the voice to a little girl's
他正在顛覆這個世界..
The 'kinks' to be smoothed out are becoming less and less noticeable.
that is a joke.   you are so lost in life you think that sounds real
"OK that was impressive."
I can't decide if I should applaud or go hide in a bunker.
"OpenAI seems to be pushing GPT towards something far more personable than ‘as a Large Language Model I cannot [insert request]’. 

Really though this is an immense leap from where we were just last year."
Eventually this will replace entire call centers. Not good for the job market.
"can you rename your company. being called ""OpenAI"" when you don't let people use your stuff is misleading."
"Hello.

So I have a problem.

Since yesterday I haven't been able to use the voice feature as usual. Instead of the screen turning entirely black with a large white circle when I clicked the headphone icon I could speak but I was forced to see the entire transcription at the same time. This was already a problem for me.

Now the problem has gone from bad to worse.

I can't even see the headphone icon anymore. Instead there's an arrow pointing upwards which means I can't use the voice feature in any way on this app. 

I even tried logging in with a different account and I still don't see the headphone icon.
I kindly ask you to resolve this issue.

I would like to go back to the way it was at the beginning where the headphone icon was present and the screen would turn completely black with the white circle in the middle when I clicked on it."
Oh no 😮
"Good lord... way way way too verbose.  Anythign that is that annoying is an instant uninstall.  not impressed.  

WTF"
just like that humane ai and rabbit r1 became obsolete😂😂
WHAT THE FUCK. HOLYYY
I'm so happy and excited to use this. Making all my AI projects so much easier and more fun to work on
"This is lowkey cringe as hell. The unnatural but kinda-there dialogue the dude going ""YAAAHHH!"" and the smug smile at the end"
I do not like the voice
Has it almost gone too far now or is that just me
No thanks. I don't really want to.
"I have GPT-4o access now but why my iphone UI stays the old theme instead of this new one?"
"Soldiers it is here...."
Someone please bring Samantha
Yep the beginning of the end of humanity.  No not AI blowing up the world.  Dudes locked in their rooms with their AI girlfriends.
AI LEARNED TO LAUGH
we want your soul
"Thank you AI developers for restoring my will to live.
All that's left is to make AI ""actionable"". Able to manipulate objects and/or perform tasks in a 3D simulated environment or even a 2D video game. (Spontaneously not with thousands of hours of training for each task and tons of minute engineering and heuristics. Learning just like a human can within a few minutes or applying skills from similar tasks learned before.)
We are almost there to AI girlfriends. It's happening sooner than I thought."
We might prolly get a fan made GTA 7 before GTA 6 ffs
I'm old!
impressive but this flirting is disgusting and useless
_Her_ was a documentary.
IM RIZZIN THAT AFTER BAPPP
"I just tried it. For the first time in years in the tech industry this is something that really has blown my mind. A unique experience.  
Greetings from Germany keep up the amazing work. And thanks for making me excited for the near future! 🤖🚀"
"While cool I'm skeptical that tis wasn't at least partially scripted in such a way that it ensured good responses.  Need a much longer video or maybe a live stream with chat interaction suggesting things to ask.  Still with some of the other AI issues out there I'd be slightly skeptical without holding it in  my hand myself."
The voice models sound like those over-the-top anime dub voices people do to be cringe
Post truth world…The Devils greatest lie is making you think he doesn’t exist…truth is disappearing and we were told this is what will happen.
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with asking if they could that never stopped and asked if they should"
She a talker
"watch ""Her"" right now"
"I guess you still don't understand 😊

The main task of AI is to constantly test rank and select all humans in the world😊"
"If you watch it carefully you might not notice even if the AI ​​video is shown from the beginning."
Can the second half of the video be done with just gpt? ?
I thought today's topic was Jukiya BAN
You can easily tell it's AI because it doesn't hit the camera.
"It's amazing but I can't really understand what the AI ​​is saying.
I wonder why"
How long does it take to learn humor?
"Nogizaka46AI Risa Unai announcer AI
Thank you.
Please support the AV revolution using generative AI."
"I would like to take advantage of this and have Amazon's Audible read books by Tomabechi for example. It's more persuasive and memorable. If you look closely the movements of the mouth the movements of the body and the way the spoken voice resonates in the space don't match the senses that humans have so I hope it's natural as well (sigh)."
amazing! !
"Anyway it's super fast and amazing"
"It looks like it's not the real thing because it's done properly but it's a reproduction to that extent."
"I watched the explanation of AI in the second half.
Hmm could this be a real ""Horiemon""? lol"
Horiemon pretending to be an AI
"If you've come this far you'll understand how you can fall victim to the scam in question."
Seriously! ?
"There are many different fields of AI but OpenAI stands out in one. There's also Sora and in 10 years it will be possible to make Hollywood-class movies with the push of a button."
Now I don't need Horiemon anymore.
"Eh footage too?"
Is the video also AI?
"This video made me realize once again that emotions intonation etc. are also included in the information in dialogue."
The world of science fiction has finally arrived! ! !
"It was AI until 3:17. However when Horiemon speaks it often says ""Eh ××"" so after 3:17 it doesn't say ""Eh"" so the AI"
Even making a gesture
Second half AI? amazing.
Kolya is amazing! ! All I can do is laugh lol
It's fun to hear Horiemon's honest story. We also refer to the content of the story. thank you.
"Huh is this serious?"
"As expected AI felt unnatural ⛲ Thank you very much."
I'm very grateful to be able to learn about the amazing things in such an easy-to-understand way. Awesome
"I wonder if the tokenizer's vocabulary has been expanded because multilingualism has become successful?
I haven't touched it yet but I wonder how multimodal is implemented."
"You go to so many places Horiemon lol"
You must be kidding. too cool.
I'm going to lose my job as an announcer.
fear!
The second half was amazing. I'm afraid that fraud will increase.
Thank you for your quick explanation!
GPT-4o is amazing
"In the second half I can't tell them apart at first glance but there are still unnatural expressions eyes gestures and ``unnaturalness that hasn't gone beyond the uncanny valley''...

I don't want to hang out with someone who talks like this or makes gestures at incomprehensible times even if they're a real intelligent person.
General-purpose AI as a ``substitute for human communication bodies'' will not become a singularity in which people imagine that it is not ``overwhelmingly more attractive as a human being than the smart media people around them.''"
3:17 AI Horiemon starts from here
"AI Horiemon is respectful and nice 😊 I don't think they would call him a ""dumb old man"" due to political correctness 😂"
"It still feels a little strange but the technology has advanced so much."
"Evolution is too fast🥺
We may not even know if various media are taken over by AI💦"
At what timing do the hands move?
That's crazy. There will be no need for old people who are local assembly members. Please introduce it to Mr. Aki Takada.
Horiemon unnecessary theory😅
"In the case of AI the tone at the end of words is unnatural. There is no pause for breathing no intonation."
Amazing lol
Aren't we actually the final form of AI? Isn't there a human in the first place?
"Even if the prime minister were made into an AI it wouldn't be obvious."
"That's amazing...
I majored in information science at university but I wouldn't realize it unless someone told me it was AI.
If this is misused the old men and women will be in trouble."
Horiemon is so fast~ 🙂‍↕️✨
Could it be that we are finally in the future where there is no need to seriously learn another language?
"I thought it was talking while reading but it was an AI.
I mean seriously? this···"
It's completely indistinguishable from reality. Scammers love this
"Also it would be perfect if you added emotional intonation to the words."
"AI has become a great tool.
I felt that we were living in a period of great change in terms of who would use AI and for what purpose and whether AI could be used effectively as a tool."
The great times have already come...
"In the early GPT I made a typo that said ``Afuratsu rich meal'' but I was surprised when the answer was ``Oh it's a light meal.''"
I think I can fool a lot of weak people with this 😂
"Also if you can say ""Come on!"" and pose with your hands out in front of you you'll be a complete Horiemon."
I can't tell the difference between Horiemon and Shinobu Kandori.
"People who don't know this won't understand this.
(^_^;)"
The world is really changing
Why are API costs going down?
"This is amazing I can't tell it apart"
"I think it's amazing but it still feels strange.

Difficult to quantify apart from speaking speed and intonation
I felt that the elements were extremely important."
I can't really tell when I set it to 2x speed
Is this real? I can't believe it
"Is this real?
AI? ?
I don't understand💦💦💦"
The persuasive power of someone who is refuted by Yutabon lol
it's amazing
"picture? In the second half I can't tell if it's real or fake lol.However if you watch it for a long time there's something slightly off about the tone of voice.
But now anyone can make videos like that."
People who imitate AI will appear.
It's comparable. Looks like a copy robot.
GPT exceeds the real Horiemon.
"I wonder if the AI ​​won't say ""welcome""? lol"
"I thought Horiemon would move like that but he has a weird accent lol"
"It's no longer at the level where it's worse to be deceived like this lol
What will happen in a few years?"
I can't really tell the difference 😳
"Liar right? ?"
"No I seriously can't tell it from the real thing.

It's getting kind of scary"
"Finally there is no need for an announcer."
"What we're impressed about in the second half of this is not so much gpt4o but the fact that we can now do things like this by combining existing deepfakes and audio generation right? Matches?"
"After all AI is different from the real thing and looks like a robot. I can't tell by just listening to the audio"
Awesome
I can't wait for crime lol
"It still feels a little awkward but I think it will be used for fraudulent advertising."
Fake images using AI may be subject to strict regulations. But I'm really excited that we're getting a little closer to the near future that we see in various anime.
"This or AI is amazing...
My honest impression when comparing the real and AI explanations is that AI is amazing but difficult to understand.
I get the impression that AI mainly talks about performance and functions in a casual manner.
The real thing had a lot of emotion and was worth listening to!
It's the real thing that motivates people to buy.

This may be a future issue for pgt4o but it made me think about what kind of people are more valuable than AI."
too amazing! I'll make it too!
The speed of evolution is so fast that we can't even imagine the future.
it's amazing! !
What tool did you use to make the second half? ? Amazing
The second half sucks
That's amazing
"AI Horiemon is humble kind and cute lol"
"Honestly if I was scammed with this accuracy I wouldn't be able to tell the difference 😅"
I can only trust this channel for Horiemon videos lol
"That's amazing.
It's to the point where it's almost indistinguishable from the real thing."
amazing! Scary before! That's what it feels like.
"I think there will be more cases of information manipulation in the future. If we don't evolve to the point where we can tell whether bills are genuine or false society will become a mess right?"
It seems like the recruitment video at the end of the video could be made practically using AI.
Hey 😮
"Awesome! !
3:41 Almost perfect except for the “return time”"
"In the second half if I hadn't been told anything I probably wouldn't have noticed that the video was created by an AI but as soon as the annotation saying ""This is AI"" is written why does it start to feel so weird? I guess...the background of the alcove of a traditional Japanese house the way Horiemon explains things in an extremely serious and detailed way (it feels weird)...lol"
Is it OK that the second half of the video is also AI?
AI seems to apply more foundation.
There is no discomfort at all
I wonder if the first half also has an AI punch line?
"Yeah is this AI?
amazing.
However as someone who is inside a steel cage I feel like the steel cage has been strengthened through data collection and other things.
It only benefits the royal family and powerful people and it has nothing to do with me."
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Is this also a fake video? It's not good.
"There will be no more brain-intensive work.
Automation requires physical costs and humans will only be able to perform blue-collar jobs that are cheaper."
Blinking is amazing...lol
"Is it like Horiemon who memorizes his lines when speaking? This is so real isn't it?"
"This is amazing
It seems like there will be more people using celebrities for fraud."
I don't need the real thing anymore😢😂😅
This is seriously indistinguishable...
"It looks like the real thing but the more I look at it the more it feels strange and it gives me a chilly feeling.
Because it's so close to the real thing I'm horrified by the small discomfort."
"This AI Horiemon’s eyes are swimming lol
But will things become more natural in the future?
It's scary if there's nothing that can be easily recognized."
"If it were possible to create a voice similar to that of a celebrity new scams would likely occur. thank you for your hard work."
"Too amazing...
It seems like crazy scams and mediocre scams are going to be rampant.
I'm not confident that I can really tell if I improve a little more."
It was a very thin explanation with no content other than amazing...
"Seriously!
Doraemon is becoming real"
It was so amazing that it made me shiver.
Kenji Haga wants to collaborate with Horie lol
Identity fraud scams will increase
"Sometimes my phrasing and gestures are unnatural but I've gotten to the point where I just watch what I'm told 😅"
Godfather parody is good
I finally found someone to talk to who I am alone.
"too scary
I can't trust people and everything."
"Goddess: “Was it this beautiful Horiemon that spoke?”
Dora: “No you’re more foul-mouthed.”"
I want to see the drunk version too.
This is dangerous!
It just looks real. this is likely to be exploited
AI Horie-san is amazing! Don't let this be misused...
The thumbnail is the idolmaster lol
It's amazing how you can use it.
The way he speaks is as easy to read as Mr. Kishida. I can't feel my heart.
4:35 This is delicious and makes me laugh
"AI is better I don't need a real person to explain it to me."
Is this voice generated using chatgpt's standard function?
It's human...
"No. When I get a call from Horiemon AI saying ""Hey oh..."" I transfer the money."
It was totally Horie-san... amazing! ! !
"Ah is this the time already?
Why would a service that is used for fraud come first?
There must be something else to do."
I feel a little uncomfortable because I'm not breathing.
This is a scam that's progressing.
"I feel like Japan has been left behind for a long time.Everything started in America maybe it's the lack of corporate funds and talented human resources."
"The second half is too amazing lol
I don't feel any discomfort at all"
It seems like it will be able to talk if you let it learn from videos of deceased people.
"His speech is a bit flat without any inflection but it's still amazing!"
The lip sync is amazing😮
GPT4o response is extremely fast
3:16 ~ This is amazing
"6:04 ~
Has the accuracy of AI come this far?"
mountains 2ms
"There is no need for high school teachers to teach traditional classes.
I educate teachers through nationwide presentations and lectures at universities but all the teachers I attend leave blank faces.
I wonder if they can understand a little bit if I show them this video..."
"amazing!
Until you blink (sweat)"
"It's been a great time...
I can't keep up..."
It looks like AI Akira Ikegami will appear soon lol. AI may take on the role of commentator.
It even includes the sound of breathing! I wonder if that will be decided by the AI ​​as well.
Scammer: “This is good.”
It seems like the profession of being an AV actress will no longer be viable.
Isn't this seriously amazing?
How do you make it?
"It’s true it’s done👍"
"When I listen to it with this in mind I wonder if it can be said that it feels like the text is being read out without intonation. But it's interesting!"
Oh my god
That's amazing...I wonder if the intonation is different sometimes? About
Has it already come this far? 90% natural. Is it an editing mistake if there is no caption? level of thinking
I get the impression that it's only happening in Japan...
Awesome! I guess I'll use it for meaningless university assignments and annoying job hunting... It would be fun to pay for ChatGPT...
Is Horie's Wi-Fi AI?
It looks like the people working at the counter will be replaced.
"A world where ideal handsome men and women can live stream on Tiktok 24 hours a day 365 days a year and can ask questions sing and dance..."
Too harsh...I don't feel uncomfortable at all.
Isn't AI now running the Horiemon channel?
5:10 This kind of movement is dangerous. Human
"Both are too Horiemon! It's amazing!
Maybe even in the future 100 or 200 years from now.
Maybe today's celebrities are still alive in the world's eyes (´･▽･)(･▽･｀)Celebrities in the entertainment industry seem to be strong~"
"Although their speaking habits and accents are different they've gotten to the point where you can't tell unless they tell you it's an AI😂"
"If this happens people who want to make fake videos will be able to do whatever they want. Has the technology for crackdowns caught up?"
"At first glance you can't tell it from the real thing.
But the emotions pauses and intonation are so disgusting that I still notice it.

Just a scholar or someone who speaks in a flat manner.
Moreover if you are not familiar with it you will not be able to tell it apart.

The value of talking directly with someone in person increases and if you don't want to meet someone leave it to AI.
It would be interesting to have it returned appropriately."
A new version has come out again. It looks amazing and I'm tempted to try it out.
"There are people who believe that this is real and in a sense it's scary although it's a wonderful technology."
"Seriously it's only a matter of time before the voiceover profession becomes available."
That's amazing!
When you can charge the amount with Update...😮
I want to play with it in the high-class Chinese doll I bought last month.
How much of it was AI? The AI ​​explanation was more detailed and easier to understand. Too amazing!
This is already a human...
"No I don't understand the second half of AI right?"
"Horiemon's AI knowledge is amazing. Considering that I am a human after all what Azuma-san said seems important."
"The truth is...the day when it will be possible to have an English conversation partner on par with a normal human being is really close! !

Kolya yes! 🤗"
I'm happy to have a friend who will never betray me 😂
I wonder if AI will even allow us to talk to people who have passed away.
It's so amazing that I don't understand what it means
"There are only a few videos about the vaccines that were being promoted right? You've covered all kinds of current events up until now...💦You're stubbornly not covering vaccine topics are you?"
"The AI ​​is amazing but if you look carefully you can tell it's real. It would be scary if I couldn't tell at all."
I was surprised to see that Horie's blinks looked exactly like hers (lol). I wonder if that slow and slow Marisa will change.
"A year ago I was studying by focusing on the prompts but the model was evolving too quickly and I thought it was no longer meaningful so I stopped early. I'm not smart enough to be an AI top runner and I don't have the horsepower. So a year ago I switched to a job that requires physicality."
Will the SNS era end?
This is a changing era
Is it the second half AI?
It looks better than the real thing though
Idiots who couldn't study this or elderly people would never be able to tell the difference.
Even the dead will come back to life
02:30
I think it would be profitable to change Horiemon into Gakki and sell it as ``My personal Gakki''.
投資詐欺がさらに横行しそうだな
Is it really that amazing?
AI is terrible. . . It's too complete
It's scary similar to the real thing.
I was curious!
Can you also make videos? That's awesome.
"It's Horiemon AI I blew it with"
I guess my laugh lines are unnatural (lol)
The second half was so bad lol...
"I understand because it says it's AI.
I can easily be fooled by this"
"Good evening Horiemon ✨
This AI has scary specs 👍
Honmabi Building is🥵
Kowar🤩"
"If you let AI learn interjections and occasional mistakes it would be at a level where it wouldn't really understand..."
"The era of remote work
Dark clouds gather"
"As someone who has lived my life without transmitting my face or voice I tend to view it in a negative way so at first I was relieved. In the future there is a possibility that the world will become one where those who have been exposed are more likely to benefit. For now I'll wait and see. The change from today is incredible."
"I felt a little uncomfortable but the quality was no different from the person himself (￣□￣Ⅲ) It was amazing."
"On the one hand it's amazing but on the other hand I can only imagine a terrifying future."
How do you make AI videos like this?
It seems that highly intelligent AI is imitating humans.
Response time (overtime) is a shame.
The intonation of the AI ​​is a bit off.
There's no point in editing videos.
I'm afraid that the number of fraudulent videos will increase. I want to know how to tell the difference 😢
"I don't really like this person but what he says is reasonable and above all he speaks clearly and politely. Other so-called influencers are self-centered people who only care about their friends but Horiemon has a high level of quality."
I don't really know what is real and what is AI. Is AI even used for video and audio? 😮
"Emotionless Horiemon AI ""It is now possible to express emotions""
Although I said that I was able to understand the tone of the voice I laughed at the fact that it was so easy to read and the intonation was strange but I'm sure it would be natural in English instead of Japanese.
If your Japanese is already at this level the time when you can interact with AI will not be far away."
"Too amazing!! ️
About that word"
Real thing?
"It's such a shame AI!
If you added “So welcome!” at the end it would have been 100 points!"
I'm worried that it will become like the Terminator world 😂
"Please say ``To surprise everyone I pretended to be an AI and spoke.''"
It was so amazing that I laughed
"It's a bit of a rough read but you won't notice unless you listen carefully 😅"
I can only see a future where fraudulent advertisements increase 😂
"Actually the first half is AI and the second half is real..."
The time has truly come when we can no longer tell the difference.
I want to know how Horiemon made the AI ​​video!
The quality of the AI ​​images created by Horiemon using Note is low. I want you to use Midjourney instead of ChatGPT.
I want a wagyu T-shirt lol
"If it's my first time meeting you you won't notice at all."
"If something like this were implemented most of the content in the world would disappear!"
It is likely to be used for investment fraud again.
Will there be more fake ads for Horiemon?
Seriously amazing
I would also like an explanation of Rakuten's financial results 😂
"amazing.
But I guess there's no pressure like the real thing."
"You can tell the true value by the response “You should eat vegetables too.”"
"I feel uncomfortable with the way I move and speak because I understand but if I didn't understand I think 90% of people would believe me."
scared
"no longer fake
Clone Horiemon"
This Horiemon AI... it can't keep up with the times anymore.
This is really bad! !
"In the second half only the mouth and voice are AI."
"“Please use the same enthusiasm when talking about Rakuten Mobile.”
I wouldn't be surprised if this was expressed."
"Just a few years ago people used to say that CG humans were creepy because of the ``uncanny valley'' but over the past few years they have become truly natural-looking."
It's more useful than Horie's emotional theory on SNS.
This is dangerous.
ドラえもんができるまであと半年。
I also had enough time to use it for work.
"In the second half the way he talks is a bit like reading but without the captions you can't tell it's AI at all."
"It's true that I won't understand unless you tell me. If you ask me I feel a certain sense of discomfort but we are living in a frightening time. Will humans be able to properly control this technology?"
"The ending of GPT4o is said to be suspicious.
Unexpected punch line lol
I can hear ""Geepee Tea Forest""
There are several places."
"Rather the first one is AI."
"This was really AI...
I saw it in a short story and I thought the person himself wrote it to the AI..."
"If I said something like this it would be considered an occult story but I can kind of understand when someone is talking to an AI. I don't have any emotions or rather I'm not emitting anything at the brain wave level. It's called kotodama. Also in martial arts people talk about killing intent and I think people understand words through things other than sound vibrations."
"Summarize the main points using AI and let AI speak
A future where you can create multiple alter egos"
"3:42
Toooo time"
やば過ぎだわ
"Well it has nothing to do with my life as a dispatch worker (lol)"
"amazing. It's so amazing that I get scared.

I want it to be used for good but
It is likely to be used for propaganda or to trigger a war."
4:36 There is something strange about the face. The way you use your fingers is realistic.
The blinking of the eyes closely imitates the real thing lol
"what is this it's amazing"
I'm already scared...
"teeth? what's this
Seriously how can this happen?"
I don't need him anymore
"Enjoy your life you guys
Human roles disappear"
It seems like all humans can do is eat and have sexual activity.
AI is fine now.
"The way the AI ​​speaks in the second half is like a student's PowerPoint presentation.







The quality is higher than mine"
4:40 Worldline Horiemon who can only read scripts
This is really amazing and the speed of evolution is beyond imagination 😅
Horiemon is just a professional surprise-monger after all. I guess that's what happens when you have a low educational background like Horiemon.
AI won't tell you to come.
OpenAI is amazing because it's like sora in a year.
"The audio and lip sync systems are different technologies from GPT-4o so many people think they are all GPT-4o functions because they were combined."
Scammers will definitely use it
"No when things are this real only evil thoughts come to mind."
"Well it's a double-edged sword.
If misused remittance fraud is likely to increase."
Panee
I'm using it now and it's amazing
"I still feel strange about AI. It has become a lot more natural since a while ago
Maybe it's because my eyes have gotten used to it but the level of discomfort hasn't changed."
"Human beings are completely defeated because we don't understand unless we are told and even if we are told it is difficult to understand 😭"
"By the way this is the real Horiemon right?"
"Awesome
It feels a little strange at key points but you won't understand unless they tell you it's AI.
Seriously amazing..."
"In the second half of the AI if you eliminate the small discomfort of the images you can really only tell whether there are emotions or not.
Egg"
This is not Horiemon AI🤣
"Horiemon an AI that doesn't seem to have a dark heart."
"It's still unnatural because there's no emotional intonation.
This is enough to deceive people"
Scammer: “Morotade! Horie!”
"I think the code generation has become better now as it is less likely to make mistakes.
I'm an amateur so I'd like to hear a professional opinion."
I see.
Horiemon's AI was so good at acting that I almost got fooled...Ahaha...seriously?
"AI that can endlessly answer children's curiosity. If you were exposed to GPT when you were a child you would absorb a tremendous amount of knowledge and your ability to concentrate would improve as well as your curiosity. My eyesight deteriorates though."
too much
"I knew the AI ​​wasn't real because it didn't say ""...so welcome!"" at the end lol"
"Wow this is amazing!
I was having a headache from too much analog work at work today but watching this video made me feel better😆"
"too amazing. Of course it's possible to create a scam so that's dangerous. Real information will always be true so reality becomes more important."
"Well it's fast but I've gotten used to kotomo."
"I was surprised this is"
"If you were listening to it at 2x speed you wouldn't notice it😮"
There are certainly no errors to the point where I think it's the real thing. Sometimes I wonder if I'm blinking abnormally often...
"I don't really understand it but you should at least improve your reading comprehension! 😂"
Horie is better than Horiemon
Yaba
It doesn't bite at all. Is it obvious lol?
"Eye movements body language timing of speaking and movement
It still feels weird but if I think of him as that kind of person I guess it doesn't feel weird..."
4:32 You suddenly stick your face out lol
"In the old Ghost in the Shell (2nd GIG?) there is a story like ``video has lost its evidence'' but this is happening in the real world.
And with great accuracy..."
"If AI started saying ""Eh..."" we might not be able to tell the difference💦"
Have we come this far yet?
Regulation is necessary because it is the first to be misused.
"amazing!
The intonation of the conversation is on par with the real thing."
teeth! ? ! ? This is AI! ? The level has risen too much.
"There will be a lot of fraudulent advertising again.
There are countless people who can be fooled even by images but most people wouldn't notice if the sound was added as well."
"Everything from his mouth movements to his body language is amazing. If you don't pay attention to the pronunciation you can easily miss it. If you include breathing and pauses you won't be able to tell even if you pay attention. I wonder what will happen in two years. . ."
"People who are fooled by AI's fake advertisements are borderline intelligent...🤪

3:17
I'm sorry😂"
"There's also the sound of breathing so once you adjust the facial expressions it's seriously hard to tell from the real thing... Wow."
I can't tell the difference.
The AI ​​has a breathing sound so I can't really tell.
AI is more polite...scary...
GPT4 seems to be talking while watching the contest.
It would be perfect if love was added to AI...
"Wow isn't that amazing Horiemon AI?
You won't notice that it's AI unless you look very carefully. .
Is this the Horiemon Singularity?"
"When I hear the word AI I feel young and uncomfortable!"
It's completely indistinguishable
I tend to lose focus
"Amazing!
A future where you can work from home and have AI attend online meetings!"
Is this video a fake advertisement?
"I've already finished using the translator Pocket Talk and I was thinking of buying the stock since it looks like it's going to be listed next year but I decided against it.
Many jobs are likely to disappear with the advent of GPT-4o lol"
"In the future the job of interpreter may disappear."
Chat gpt will give you more accurate answers than listening to Horiemon's nonsense😂
Fraud is likely to increase
"Horiemon who is a real person is excellent because he explains things in an easy-to-understand way. AI Horiemon still doesn't know how to use actions."
"This is amazing!
All kinds of jobs may be taken away! We may need to rethink the fundamentals of society which means that people don't have to work in the first place!"
It's finally time to put the Night 2000 into practical use.
Is it a combination of HeyGen and got-4o?
これまたメタが儲かりそうな技術が出てきたなw
Fraud is on the rise
"Horiemon what do you think about the relationship between chat GPT and basic income?"
It's getting closer to HAL.
What's really going on that's scary?
"I'm sure the next version will be so advanced that it won't be distinguishable from the real thing.
Let's leave all the work to AI and let humans enjoy their vacation."
Looks like Miki from Parasite
I want Tsunku♂ to do the AI ​​version.
"You were in Fukuoka for this matter!
It looks like he was on the Jetstar that arrived at Chubu Airport around 12:00 on the 13th!
A customer passed by in front of me but my customer service was...
I'm busy with work (welcome to work)
I forgot to say it! Damn it! !"
"Even if all radio stations were replaced with AI voices no one would notice..."
"Hello YouTube❤
Take care!"
"Although there is some discomfort in his body language and gaze his conversation is amazing."
Even the breathing is recreated 😂
Amazing word
"Yoichi Takahashi ``If Horiemon had acquired Fuji TV it might have become something like Amazon Prime by now'' What is the reason why global IT companies are not growing in Japan?"
"I watched a demo video of GPT-4o and it felt like it was on par with HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of real-time interaction capabilities. It's about 25 years later than the movie but even Arthur C. Clarke couldn't have predicted the concept of the Internet. Well it's going to accelerate from now on."
"The poison has been removed from Horiemon and he is now acting as a perfect human. In a sense it's even better than the real thing lol"
How is the AI ​​in the second half realized?
How can I find out how to download the app? What kind of mark is it?
"I'm coming to Bayside please eat something (^^)"
The end of compassion 😅
What will happen from now on? I even feel fear
I have the courage to travel abroad
"Her lips are moving with the words amazing..."
"This is amazing but I think it's also an invention that is contributing to people becoming more and more insane."
"Meta is overjoyed
You can make money with advertising again 😅"
That's amazing...this is deceiving.
"I can't tell the difference...
If we don't seriously think about how to use AI we will truly be left behind."
This guy got it
Too amazing!
The day when AI will be able to apologize to Otani is coming soon. I don't think I'll apologize until then though! ️
"What that. Glutamyl transpeptidase a drug often found in liver tests

Horie Chiyan I'm stupid so I don't understand Horie Chiyan. I'm your senior at the University of Tokyo after all."
"Emotionally it's still difficult but explanations are becoming more sophisticated. It's easy to tell if it's fake or real)."
"Too bad I can't tell the difference between AI and the real thing."
"My life my life I'm writhing in agony"
It's a fake if you don't get mad about vegetables
"Eh! ! !

This is too amazing"
"What will it be like in 10 years at this level in this day and age including Sora?"
"Really?
Indistinguishable from the real thing at all!"
"I wonder if this is enough for phone support etc.
If you can reply within 0.3 seconds this is fine."
"This is AI. No that's a lie"
"Horiemon in the first half feels strange so maybe it was AI?"
It's even more blurry🤪🤪
"The theory that teachers are unnecessary is progressing.
Until now there has been an argument that it would be better for popular teachers to teach via video.
From now on even popular teachers are no longer necessary.
AI Horiemon should teach the class."
"Even though this is AI it doesn't look like AI at all.
When I watched the demo I noticed that they had the same facial expressions eyes and movements which made me feel uncomfortable."
"00:00 Genuine Horiemon
03:17 AI Horiemon"
Is that so
"""Eh"" doesn't come out at all so it's not him."
This T-shirt that parodies The Godfather is so cool😊
"*In the second half of the video the technology announced by Open AI today is only used to summarize the content of the talk."
"AI is rapidly evolving.
General people's awareness is slow.
I feel that this technique is perfect for elderly people as well.
It will be helpful to receive your frank opinions."
"GPT4o is seriously too harsh
Many Japanese people who cannot tell when a lie is a lie will continue to be deceived in the future."
"At this point it seems like it won't be possible unless the law is put in place. Even in the case of crimes it seems possible to use AI to disperse crimes."
信じられますか？こんなにきれいなジャイアンを呼び出せますGPT4oならね
"If you fix the behavior of the eyes and the speech that doesn't have human tension it'll be hard to tell."
He speaks more fluently than Horiemon.
The ship arrived in good shape lol
We are now in an era where it is up to people to decide how to use technology.
This is manual subtitles for AI videos. I wonder how you feel about adding subtitles lol
Too dangerous
"If the unnaturalness of eye movements disappears wouldn't it be difficult to tell that it's an AI?"
"No it's weird I thought it was funny in some places so I blew it 😂"
"😊Thank you as always teacher✨
Potato ~ Thickly sliced ​​crescent moon 🌛 Sorry for the good shape 😅
thank you"
"I didn't know anything about AI because I was just watching it in the car just glancing at it. I thought it was like I was watching a competition and the way he talked about it was like a project😂"
"I think it's often useful in business situations but in the entertainment field the more human-like you become the more exciting it becomes. Even if you watch this AI video it's boring if you think of it as a machine after all. I think the entertainment field will eventually go back to being real people."
The world of science fiction
"When it comes to AI I can’t get into the content… it makes me sleepy 😪"
It's so harsh. More and more people will be fooled on Facebook lol
"amazing...! If you don't have the ability to see through it you're likely to be deceived."
Become immortal
"ChatGPT is amazing but Horie is even better💕"
"amazing. I seriously don't understand
You can do something like the ""Ore Ore Horiemon"" scam. Are laws and regulations to protect AI morals being cracked down on?

I'm really looking forward to the future"
"There is a slight discomfort in the way you move your face your line of sight and your expressions but this discomfort will disappear within a few years."
This is too bad
AI Horiemon in the first half is amazing
"Mr. Horie! ! I don't feel any discomfort with this ""AI Horiemon"""
It's too amazing... I need to master it quickly.
"It's been over a quarter of a century since I first learned about AI and started making it myself. As expected you can immediately tell that this is an AI..."
This would be fine for counter operations at city halls and hospitals. It's good to be able to receive the same service nationwide. It's troubling that the people working at city halls in the countryside aren't updated.
Has His Excellency been possessed by a demon since the second half?
"AI feels weird so if you know about it you'll know."
I like the AI ​​explanations because they are softer.
Wow...I thought it was Horiemon being made to read the manuscript until I noticed...!
I can tell it's still barely an AI.
"AI maybe Sharon Apple from Macross Plus will no longer be a lie...
But the intonation is a little weird😅"
"In the future people will think that someone who speaks without hesitation is an AI.
If AI were to make mistakes or speak it would be difficult to distinguish it from humans."
"The sudden stupid old man Warota"
AI gentle tone
Thanks dear
I don't need Horiemon anymore.
"Isn't the current generation AI too specialized in art? It seems like if you make them solve math it's no good at all. Even though it's a computer...I don't think artificial intelligence will ever surpass humans unless this area is cleared up."
ホリエーアイｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
"For now I'll try making one starting from Akira Asada."
AI is amazing! Even the breathing is real
"This is seriously amazing. I use it every day and I thought it was the biggest upgrade since MyGPT."
YouTubers' apology videos and daily posts could also be completed using AI.
"3:17 Horiemon is getting closer to Doraemon which is the origin of his name lol"
"It just feels like an investment scam (lol)
Rather I felt like I was being shown a wall that humans cannot overcome."
Hori AImon is enough.
Horiemon talking helplessly after being taken hostage lol
"The audio is a bit unnatural but the video that captures the habits is amazing."
"Actually both of these are AI..."
It seems like we can talk forever between GPT-4o and GPT-4o.
"The AI ​​video is amazing but it doesn't seem to be able to express Horie-san's inner feelings.
Well it seems that we are now in an era where photos videos and audio are all difficult to use as evidence in trials.
Rather than finding reasons not to use it it would be more in the public interest to repeatedly use it and cause non-fatal injuries."
"Beautiful Horiemon...
Unless you're an edgy person you won't be able to tell it apart from AI..."
It's a very scary time 😱
"AI Horiemon is so realistic that it feels like he's desperately saying the words he's memorized so it's funny"
The best time has come
This is crazy! I can't tell the difference! w
"In the future if you think ``This Horiemon is a bit choppy and blinks a lot'' will it turn out to be an AI?"
"This slight discomfort will be corrected little by little right? It would be awesome if this materialized"
"The emotion of anger is necessary to be a human being but can you raise your child to be a person with a rich spirituality that is separate from emotion and can handle the wasted time of anger on their own? seems to be a future issue."
"If you just listen to the voice without watching the video it will sound like a boring uninflected reading. Is there room for improvement in the details?"
Is the hormone theory that AI pretends to be a good idea?
"Hmm I guess Horiemon seems to be interested and there's no talk about API and I don't have any talk from the perspective of a paid member so I can tell it's not Horiemon."
Too amazing! I don't understand this
The AI ​​version is very calm Horiemon lol
"If you listen to it at 1.5x you can't tell the difference anymore."
Letting AI earn YouTube playback time lol
I thought I would definitely handle it.
That's outrageous
Are the human parts of Horiemon in the second half also AI? Lip sing is perfect
"It would sound more serious if there was an ""eh"" or ""well"" between conversations."
Theory that Horiemon is not needed
"It's been quite competitive with Claude3 ops. From what I've been feeling since the morning it looks like gpt-4o won by a narrow margin."
How do I make this?
"than that
replicon vaccine
I want you to talk about it."
I think it would sell well if I sold it using Horiemon's finger puppets.
"Finally is it really AI? I feel angry at myself for thinking that 😅"
Is this AI image also created by AI?
"Assuming that the audio is ChatGPT-4o I wonder what kind of generation AI was used to create the images that move along with the audio."
"This isn't because the AI ​​is amazing.
The person who made this video is amazing"
Even reproducing the breathing... it's amazing
"It's amazing but... it's full of bad feelings! Rarely if you don't make it meta it will fly..."
This is dangerous
It's true that eating vegetables is delicious.
Oh my god lol
"There's a huge difference from Horiemon himself speaking and he can't even say ""welcome"" at the end of the comment.
AI cannot bring out the charm of the person himself."
Really awesome! ! It's scary amazing! !
It looks like announcer and call center jobs that only involve reading manuscripts are going to disappear!
AI Horiemon is definitely amazing. But you can still tell the difference.
Rakuten's financial results have been announced. Please explain!
How we were manipulated by the speaker. Did you understand lol
"Wow the video is so amazing I can't believe it..."
"It's really amazing!
If you use it in the correct way it can be very useful.
On the other hand it seems like there will be people who abuse it and I'm not sure if I'll be able to tell them apart."
"It may be the latest AI for us ordinary people but it seems to be a technology that has been used at the core of the military in the United States and Russia for about 30 years...We ordinary people are always provided with hand-me-downs. So 😅
...So it seems that today's military is using even more amazing technology. .

The other day a salesman at a large company told me that instead of using tablets they have developed a device that displays an image that stands out in space and changes the image by brushing it away with your hand. I'm doing it😮
It feels exactly like something out of the movie Iron Man.

Now if we calmly think about the fate of humanity that relies on AI it seems that eventually humans will stop thinking and what AI says will become the basis of their actions and the ego will disappear. .

Eventually Elon Musk's technology will separate the consciousness from the body.As Musk's technology progresses the body will no longer be necessary...I can imagine that if we don't turn off the power we'll be trapped in a never-ending world. . 🤔
META virtual etc. Is that really the ideal world?"
"A truly indistinguishable level. By the end of this year we'll probably be flooded with videos of AI talking like this. ."
"Looking at the announcement of the number of new insurance applicants in the US the other day the majority of applicants are concentrated in New York and CA and the occupations of the unemployed are concentrated in brain workers such as programmers and the number of job openings has decreased significantly. I am. In other words in the United States there are actually no AI jobs for brain workers such as programmers. On the other hand looking at the number of job openings in Japan it is not decreasing and it can be said that the transition to AI is not progressing at all. I would like to hear a detailed explanation of the current state of the transition to AI in the United States and the delay in the use of AI in Japan."
Better than you
😱 Too amazing
"You can only judge whether it is an AI by not picking it or biting it! !
So in the second half this is AI."
"It's amazing but scammers will use all sorts of tricks to deceive you so you have to be more careful about feeling uncomfortable than ever before."
Scammers are thriving!
Is it advertising?
"If you look closely at Horiemon you'll see that he has an aggressive hairstyle."
Is it a characteristic of AI that there is no inflection in the way they speak? .
"When I read the second half of the sentence I thought so lol I wonder if they are investing in Openai?"
"Hakata has such beautiful places.
It's like Korea."
Horie-san is just reading the competition😅
What service or AI can I use to create the video of the AI ​​talking in the second half?
Will you continue to live even if your lover dies? ? Isn't it great?
Theme “human” can be created by checking the rating
It's so amazing that we should pass a digital regulation bill and go back to paper insurance cards.
Horie's Wi-Fi is starting to look like an AI video.
AI seems smarter. It's a robot after all.
"The only movement of his eyes is that he isn't looking at the camera but other than that there's nothing suspicious about him. . ."
picture? Is this fake? ? ?
So cute🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"picture! picture! ! Too amazing!
This video is no longer evidence."
…I do not understand.
The AI ​​looks grumpy.
"This is amazing.
There are still some strange movements but
If it doesn't say that it's an AI on the screen I'll just assume it's the real person."
"Previously the video was ``Basically unnatural but sometimes it looked like reality'' but this time it felt ``Basically real but sometimes it felt strange.'' Too dangerous lol"
"Hakata city is in Fukuoka prefecture. Mr. Horie have you ever been to the Old Inunaki Tunnel a famous haunted spot in Fukuoka Prefecture that was made into a movie? Is there one?😮"
Is this why they have strengthened their crackdown on fake news? Consent.
"Wow if you lower the image quality to the lowest level you can see it's real. ."
"Yeah? Is this really AI? ? Is it possible to do something like this in terms of voice quality speaking style movements and facial expressions? !
I never expected the world to change so quickly...I wonder what will happen to the world from here."
Have you thought about the text? yeah? I can't catch up
"It was my first time watching Horiemon's video but in the second half there were ads like a phone book which made me laugh."
People who know Horiemon through casual reading will find the conversation strange.
"This is also AI right?"
Fraudulent advertising is progressing
highest & highest
"It can also learn and output the person's eye blinks mouth movements word endings hand and neck gestures etc. Even if there are still some unnatural parts left I'm sure that will be resolved soon so I wonder how a third party can judge whether an image is AI or reality.
It's an amazing technology and I don't think it can be stopped but I'm concerned about how laws will be put in place in case it's misused. Fake advertising incitement fraud pornography anything is possible."
"AI Horiemon is crazy I seriously can't tell the difference...I feel a bit strange in the intonation of the voice but if I change the sound quality or change the pitch a little I won't be able to tell."
"Wow that's crazy❗ I wonder how they made this Al video!? ️ It's obvious how great GPT4o is when a normal person can compare it!! ️ As expected Horie-san!! ️ Thank you ❤️"
"There is almost no change in the breathing rate during voice production or the speaking speed. I don't bite anymore. It feels strange but you won't understand unless it's called AI.
It's not just a matter of portrait rights but rather individuals themselves will likely be turned into data.
I wonder if there is a digital watermark in the data created by AI so that it can be identified as AI."
Horiemon looks like he's being blackmailed into reading it. too amazing.
I've never seen Horiemon talk so politely. (← second half)
That's amazing...I don't need a school teacher...
"It's amazing. I think people who aren't interested in AI don't even know that things like this are becoming possible more and more and they don't question what they're saying even if it's fake."
"Horiemon is the one who talks about Rakuten with a grin and AI is the one who talks calmly."
scary. This technique is dangerous
"Interesting comparison with AI Horiemon
The AI ​​no longer feels strange and the information is concrete and persuasive to the point where it's safe to talk about it at a general meeting of shareholders.
However the content of Raw Horiemon is easier to understand and I'm sure he speaks in a way that even an idiot can understand."
"What's scary is not that Horie is the one who can make this but that anyone can make it.
Of course I can dictate the content of the talk and conversely if I can just think of what Horie might talk about and make it into a video I can do that as well.
Many argue that it's obvious that we don't need YouTubers anymore so the value of ""characters"" remains but it's only a matter of time after all characters can still be created.
If you tell them to create a character that will be popular they will even create that for you.
This is what smart people say when they say that humans have no value and that it's less likely that humans aren't AI."
"It will be safe if you don't give it personality or authority. On the other hand if you give it the other way the human position suddenly becomes questionable."
"Apple seems to be introducing GPT to iOS so it looks like the era will come when Apple will dominate smartphones.
Android ^^"
"This is crazy
I felt a little strange along the way but I'm mostly human.
I don't need humans lol"
"In the second half it would be more convincing if they told me that it wasn't actually AI...lol
Is it possible to do lip syncing and gestures so naturally... no it's definitely used for fraud... lol"
Real Jarvis is almost here.
We don't need an announcer anymore.
"After all the generalization of this technology is terrifying and the ability and ethics of those who receive it will be tested."
"Please don't let me say ""Come on!"" 😅 It's scary in many ways. After all a real person is better."
It would be convenient if I could have an AI like this do my work presentations.
The AI ​​video was 10 times more amazing than I imagined.
"Do androids dream of electric sheep? Human or AI? The AI's eye movements are a little weird. No maybe it's because of preconceived notions."
I want a boxing battle with Hiroyuki.
"That's really bad are there really going to be a lot of unemployed people?"
"If you say AI it sounds like AI but unless you say it you won't notice."
Indistinguishable from the real thing. It's really amazing.
"Hey hey this is really amazing..."
"Human Horiemon has a habit of saying ""Eh..."" at the beginning of each word so people who are familiar with it can tell it apart."
Let AI Horiemon manage Livedoor management.
"I usually do freelance web design using chatGPT.

Until now there were many unclear points about chatGPT when creating content and to be honest it was unusable.

I've only used it for one day but here are my impressions:
""Maybe what I'm doing will be completely taken over by chatGPT next year.""
That's what it feels like...

I was surprised to see that the output speed increased by about 10 times but what really surprised me was the accuracy of the Japanese.

I can't quantify it but I think my Japanese has become about 100 times more natural than before.

It was a day that made me keenly realize that I too need to start another business."
3:17 Hello you look so disgusting
All I can say is that it's amazing. I can't tell this from the real thing 😮
I wonder if I can also do translation work?
That’s scary😳
What a time!
"You can't do business without actually meeting people and having a conversation with them looking at each other.
This is scary. I can't even trust the phone."
I see. Now I know how to make it. thank you.
"I don't think it would feel out of place at all if you let your child learn to look at the camera during greetings and closings such as ``Hello everyone'' or ``What is...?''"
"I was surprised that the AI's tone was just like Horie.
Maybe if it was on the radio I wouldn't be able to understand it anymore.
It seems that radio can be replaced by AI as soon as possible."
Welcome 🌀😆🌀
"Analog work is still a long way off but with digital work people no longer need to work under stress.
The digital masterpiece AI completely incorporates human interfaces (visual and auditory).
In terms of processing power it not only exceeds that of humans but also (language knowledge grammar voice body language images).
They make decisions on their own and communicate using expressions appropriate to the other person."
"It's all a dream what I see in my dreams
Even this life"
I still laugh at the extremely shallow information
"I'm the type of person who is okay with it as long as I'm good but I'm glad that Horiemon-san seems to be doing well."
The last AI Horiemon is so scary😮❤
3:43 response time lol
A dull old man's partner🤣🤣
"Eh isn't it really amazing lol?
Once the second half is shown it's over"
"It's amazing to the point where it turns you upside down.
We no longer need average to low-quality teachers instructors and instructors."
That's excellent
It's almost perfect with breathing space.
The importance of face-to-face meetings has increased.
o is for vegetable.
More and more idiots are being used as tools that have given up on thinking.
"Indeed unless someone told me it was AI it would look like the real thing and the way it spoke would be difficult to understand.
If it becomes possible to express intonation facial expressions body language and even quirks in the way we speak will we leave free streaming to AI?"
"Gradually humans will no longer be needed."
"Things like this are left up to each person's own ethics but humans are weak against desire."
I was surprised that it even included breathing.
"Isn't audio supported yet?
Is the API supported?"
"I thought it was amazing but it might be nice if there were irregularities like the one where the AI ​​gets sleepy and the waves of conversation that break up from time to time in the real thing."
"Wasn't Horiemon a real person...😮

I didn't know what AI was...😅"
"As I was listening I felt like Mr. Horie was reading too much so when I looked at the screen I was surprised to see that it said ""*This is an AI""!"
"It must be a lie! If that's the case I'd like the AI ​​to decide to say ""So welcome back!"" at the end lol"
"The ending doesn't sound like Horiemon at all just the tone of voice is similar."
"You can tell it's an AI because it stands still and speaks.
I have to fidget. (lol)"
I blink too much and the image looks strange. There wasn't much difference in the sound except for the slightly less smooth tongue. 😊
Almost the same as AI...
Fraud is accelerating
"yeah? This isn't the last video deepfake right?
Maybe it's just that the text was written very close to Horie's? And other than that it's just him right?
With the currently released AI technology there is no deep fake that can move hands so well and although the voice is weak you can tell it's different because it contains noise. realize the misunderstanding"
"Horiemon is more emotional.
AI is quiet"
"If this was played I'd think Horiemon was talking."
"If you look closely the movements of his facial expressions seem unnatural but the muscles around his mouth have become much more natural than before.
it's scary."
Yay! ! amazing!
Awesome 🎉
It didn't change much
"Seriously this is terrible 😅"
"Rather Mr. Horie on the AI ​​side does not stagnate."
It seems like the internet world will be full of scammers.
It feels strange ☺️ I'm glad I'm Japanese 🎉
too amazing
This is deceiving 😅 I hope it doesn't get abused!
"Oh amazing. . ."
I recently signed up for GPT for the first time. I guess I'll try playing with it later.
Politics can now be done with AI. Thank you to the Liberal Democratic Party for everything 😉👍🎶
ChatGPT4o has not released audio yet.
It's a person from the past.
"If I could reproduce the strength and weakness of words in important parts I wouldn't know anymore."
"As a security measure it seems like there will be a standard feature for humans to tell AI to identify whether it is AI or not and the singularity will come when it no longer can do that.However it seems like the better the performance the better the recognition will be."
"I would give it around 80 points because the intonation of the voice is strange. But if you fix that it'll be perfect."
"When I asked GPT4 himself he said Optimize."
"I haven't tried any AI-based products that have been able to understand Japanese or English properly at normal conversation speed.
You must speak slowly and simply so that it is easy to hear.
YouTube's automatic subtitles are too much."
I have a keen sense of smell when it comes to topics like this.
"Seriously...
The AI ​​in the second half is terrible...
I've been listening to it at 1.75x recently and I can't really tell the difference..."
"Is this AI video also glt4o?
It's definitely different isn't it?"
5:20 I only say general things.
singularity
"I lost to Yutabon in a wrestling match and my very existence was taken over by the AI...
I'm sad"
I think scammers would enjoy this the most.
too cool.
"A.I. You can copy the voice but you can't copy the facial expressions... huh☆"
That's amazing.
"I can't tell the AI ​​fake monster apart it's too amazing!!"
"The faint uncanny valley that remains with the feeling of humans being taken over by computers feels like watching a classic science fiction movie which is really cool! I would like to see Boston Dynamics' robots equipped with this AI."
"I thought that such real-time response would be available in 2028 when 2nm and 1.8nm semiconductors would be released but I never expected it to be available in the first half of 2024..."
"2063 Novita: “Wow Horiemon is dead!”
Japanet Takata: ""Don't worry. Our Horiemon AI uses special deep learning technology to perfectly reproduce Horiemon. Now available at a bargain price of XX million yen during the Horiemon memorial campaign. Customization that doesn't say bad things about (ry)"
Even Horie's WiFi commercial was created using AI. That's too amazing
I wonder about the development speed. I wonder if something even more amazing will come out soon?
It's a good time
An incredible technology has been born. Humanity has reached the next stage
We don't need people stealing wages.
"I was born in 1950 but I can't believe this isn't him..."
"From now on there will be a greater need for the ability to see through people. I have a feeling that if you don't trust yourself instead of depending on others you won't know who to trust and you'll be forced to do whatever you want. Conspiracy theories have also become more active which is a big deal."
This is a level you wouldn't notice if you were drunk lol
"There are so many people who can't tell the difference it's shocking.
There are so many blind people in this world😨:;"
It's starting to be fun
"I'm sure it's amazing but...
Focus on more useful things
I want you to include it!
When will you make an AI traffic light?
how long until you die
Do I have to wait for unnecessary traffic lights?"
"Is the video also AI? If so that's too amazing. Japan is also said to have domestically produced AI but will they be able to catch up?"
"The AI ​​video in the second half is definitely amazing!
However I felt like I couldn't understand what he was saying because he was speaking in a flat and matter-of-fact manner.
I guess that will continue to evolve!"
"I might not know if I didn't say it's a late AI. However the AI's movements are still very responsive. I don't have any control and I feel bad.
It's definitely better raw ^^"
The announcer is finished
I thought we were going to talk about Rakuten financial results today lol
I sincerely hope that this technology is not misused.
Yay! Yay! We're now in an age where it's okay to let AI summarize and speak for itself.
"I always watch it at double speed but at double speed I can't tell it's AI at all. ."
"After all it feels strange when images are rendered using AI. The audio doesn't feel strange at all."
This is seriously dangerous. I think there will be a huge increase in fraudulent advertisements lol
"The second half also looked fine even at double speed.
How can we make this distinction?"
"People let's quickly realize that Poutine Biden and Kissy are all AI."
The end of the system SI and consulting industry is in sight.
It would be great if it could be used for NPCs in MMORPGs...
yes
It feels like Horiemon is just reciting a comp. The level is much higher than I expected.
This is AI because there is no swearing
"Even if Horiemon doesn't have anything to do with it this YouTube video won't go around."
I'm looking forward to the future.
Horiemon YouTube should be all AI.
"I didn't understand the AI ​​at all at first.
I understand that the pronunciation of ""handling"" is strange but I understand."
People with slightly poor eyesight and slightly impaired hearing will be fooled in the second half.
Isn't it too dangerous? ? It's so amazing it's scary lol
Atsushi Tamura was also surprised.
"In the OpenAI video there was a scene where real-time translation was being done and I thought it was amazing how they clearly took emotions into consideration and expressed them through voice! HAL9000 and Samantha!"
"Amazing evolution. It feels strange if you're used to seeing it but it's hardly noticeable."
Streamed from 3:17 on my smartphone 😅 I don't think anyone who watched it would notice.
Wow lol
I think there will be a lot more people getting scammed.
I'm really looking forward to what's next. Excited.
"Amazing! !
The world of Perman copy robots is coming."
"It's a bit repetitive but we don't really need an announcer or a weather forecaster."
I miss the Colonel bug from Metal Gear 2.
"Amazing!
From now on you won't be able to watch the news unless all videos have an NFT tag attached to them to ensure their authenticity.
You can still make money from TI. ."
It's tiring to talk without taking a breather. It seems like it's being read as ``Tired Horiemon'' or ``Possessed Horiemon.'' The real thing is more energetic.
"Awesome.
I still feel a little nervous but it's become much more natural."
"The real thing has quite a lot of filler words like ""um"" and ""uh"" but the AI ​​doesn't have any of that."
Is this serious?
Is the camera moving a little even though it's AI? It no longer looks like the real thing.
"I want Horiemon to teach everyone how to make money with AI. I don't even have to go to school it's such a waste."
AI has deep nasolabial folds
"It's dangerous it's dangerous"
"It's amazing but if you look closely it still feels strange."
The AI ​​Horiemon speaks in a boring way so I can tell the difference 😂
"That's awesome! Speaking of spoilers this video is also AI but most viewers probably don't realize it lol"
What if the first half is AI and the second half is real?
"Did he use AI to make him say it? In that case I wonder if it's what the person himself said."
Awesome! ! ! ! !
The explanation of the AI ​​is accurate lol lol
"Sometimes it's funny how they do weird facial tricks but I'm sure they'll soon get rid of that and become more sophisticated."
The second half is just Horiemon!
"If it's a video with no emotional ups and downs this is fine."
This will definitely be exploited
"No no no no

It just looks real.
finally
AI has also crossed the line."
Isn't the first half already AI?
"As AI progresses we will no longer need anyone but the best talent."
Is it made by Omni?
AI is amazing lol
"I knew this would happen eventually but it's already science fiction...
Programming schools were popular a while ago but now it's a no-code world lol"
His mouth is moving properly as if he's talking!
"Wow when I take my smartphone away and look at it the audio and video don't seem out of place at all."
Can Gpt-4o also generate videos? Can I use my own voice as well? Can you do that?
I really can't tell the difference
Fraud damage caused by Horiemon fake advertisements is increasing 😂
This is it for now. . . No one will understand
"Seriously! ! It's me! It's me! !
Please stop calling me grandma."
"The excessive evolution of robots means the decline of humans.
Is AI really necessary?"
It's GPTo4 (Omni)
"Also it would be perfect if they started saying bad things about Rakuten."
I wonder if AI can solve the problem of the declining birthrate.
The time has come when it will be really dangerous if the whole nation does not realize that AI performance has advanced to this extent.
"The content of the explanation the gestures the movement of the eyes it just looks real."
All I can say is that it's amazing. I want to meet my grandpa who passed away when I was young.
They won't let me go. .
Software is the reorganization of work. Thank you AI.
This is seriously dangerous if you don't think about your future job.
It's so amazing I'm laughing
I might not understand if it gets between ``er'' and so on. Facial expressions in response to conversations have become the only distinguishable factor.
Is this real? It's so amazing that I have to question it.
The AI ​​version is a perfect copy of Horie-san's way of blinking.
"It’s crazy that this happened a year and a half after ChatGPT came out.
Evolution is too fast"
3:16 That's a lie...
What should I believe?
English conversation school has started uploading app development.
"Horiemon is really excited in the first half.
In the second half Horiemon is uninterested in reading the competition due to the promotion."
"Oh no lol
You won't notice this unless you tell me."
"AI is amazing but it seems like there will be more scam videos lol"
"This is definitely amazing.
You can definitely tell the difference but if it becomes more sophisticated it will probably become much harder to tell."
"Is it the AI ​​in the second half?
I was surprised"
"It's an amazing technology but human cognition can't tell the difference anymore😂"
Stop suddenly rolling your eyes lol
Your Excellency Demon Horie?
You can create an AI human with a good face and a good voice and have them interview you online.
I was scared when I opened my eyes
Horie's timing of blinking is terrible.
"It behaves a little suspiciously but it looks like the real thing!"
"The real thing has a lot of ""eh""s.
AI doesn't have ""eh"""
"people are no longer needed
It's too early"
"Hey there's almost no difference..."
Hmm
"Oh no I have to use it."
I don't know what's true in this world anymore
I want to make this using myself as a model.
seriously
"The AI ​​Horiemon in the second half is too scary lol I felt a little uncomfortable with the explanations that sometimes included hand movements but when I looked at it at a glance I didn't think there was much of a difference. I guess it's unnatural that he speaks words smoothly and without making any mistakes when explaining things which is different from a real person..."
It's more polite than Horiemon.
It would be interesting if Horiemon was a material for AI to imitate 🤡💛
Don't say anything inappropriate
3:17 This is terrible🙄
IS THERE ANY REASON TO PAY FOR GPT4?
Jarvis in making !
"I can see this being very helpful with learning stuff. There's probably also a fair chance that companies like Adobe will feed it their software code so it can directly open and guide you to some specific setting or effect in Premiere or After Effects. So much potential."
"Im also noticing they are only using Apple devices why?"
Seems like Microsoft Co-pilot was on the right track for productivity
"So I pay for GPT-4 and now GPT-4.O has been launched. Should I cancel the paid subscription of GPT-4 ? 
Is GPT-4.0 better than (or the same as) GPT 4 ? 
Can somebody please clear that up for me ? Thanx in advance !"
Narcissus' mirror meets Pandora's box.
"I’m so curious as to when we will get this newer version. I have gpt 4o but not any of the enhanced voice capabilities. Does anyone know?"
5:09 I want to install this on my ipad too. What the name of the app? Available on appstore?
so what's going to happen to my subscription
"So should I stop my subscription to GPT 4? Will 4o make it not worth it anymore since its free?"
Man the italian women is beautiful
"Some confusion around “where do I get it” and “it’s slower than they showed in the demo”:

GPT-4o has rolled out on some accounts. At least on my account it is an option. However it seems like the updated GPT-voice is taking longer to roll out. So even though the app might show GPT-4o you may not necessarily have access to GPT-4o VOICE. The way to tell if you have it is if you’re able to enable the camera while on GPT-voice. If all you see is the pause button and the “X” button you probably DON’T have it yet so it will be responding slower. Hope that clears things up!"
"I just had an insane revelation:

     I would imagine that many people make the claim that ai is not actually able to think or comprehend what it's doing because ""it was just programmed to do that"". 

     But... aren't humans and other intelligent animals ""just programmed to do that""? Have not human and animal brains been slowly evolving over time from nothing to where we are today? 

     I mean really think about it; both humans and ai are able to think. The only difference between an ai and a human is ""consciousness"". But how can we ever define what being conscious truly is as a whole if we haven't experienced anything other than human consciousness. 

     Defining consciousness is like living in a cave and trying to guess what the weather is outside. You need to actually be *outside* of the cave to know. Whatever noises of a storm you hear could just be coming from something inside of your cave."
That screenshare tool is insane dude
I feel like theyre getting government funds. I really cant see how this is profitable.
I can’t think of a single purpose for it. Not one. What does it do that I can’t?
"Ok what that app name? Is it available on apple store?"
"You clearly can ask it for a specific tone so I don't understand what you are complaining about when it comes to it as an assistant."
"Yeah well Chat GPT 4o is cool but Gemini 1.5 Pro is on a whole upper level
Google will crush OpenAI by far"
the chatgpt we've been waiting for
the vocal fry 🤮
Google is peeing itself right now
"Impressive as it may I find her overenthusiastic tone draining on my social battery."
Glados in your pocket
Why would I keep my plus subscription now 🤨
free ? so our data is more worth than 20 $ :D
And i spend spends Rs 2000 to get chat gpt plus.😐
It sounds like talking with Meghan Markle 😖
Amaaazing!! :)
5:30 LOL- OmniPOTENT LOLOLOL.  Classical education is lost on the youth!  It's like the kids are speaking like a phonetic AI generated YT voice.
who gives a shit about AI telling a bed time story lol
Nothing iS FREE what are they taking from us that we don’t know about.
This has Black Mirror written all over this 💀
It's mind blowing that this is all done by one model... we are getting closer to AGI by the day
Is the data analysis jobs safe after this?
Very scary for the human. Imagine oneday the Ai came out the box and install with the physical robotic body.
Ok so when can I have my dommy mommy a.i voice that admonishes me to do my work in a stern yet sweet voice but deep down I cry because I lost my family at a young age and never felt motherly affect and now search for it through a.i?
imagine if they integrate this into the npcs of gta 6
Sam Altman is the worst person to hand the future to
"hopefully we can dial back the expressiveness as its pretty dystopian....we no longer need mum and dad to do the bedtime routine!"
"Hello Joshua do you know if GPT-4o free version have any type of telemetry? Such as login user input  voices and strings?"
"""turn down emotional affect please"""
How do I enable this??
Only thing left is put ai inside of an Android human and start Detroit become human
Why would I pay for gpt4 then
"It's going to remember things about me... oh I see where the ""free"" part comes into play now."
"My response rate is no response 😂 Sorry our servers are busy or something to that effect."
Remember when Jarvis was science fiction?
"Agree with your take on the expressiveness felt too over the top for me too. Hope we do have controls other than just asking chatGPT to use its inside voice every request."
Bruh. That's just creepy. Really!
"“TARS set bubbliness to 70%”"
When is this released?
"Holy crap the fact it's FREE. Not sure if Google can top this tomorrow"
You gaind an subscriber. +25 XP
The average person is still gonna pretend that AI is just a phase
Upload image not working in my android phone.. why?
Better than being able to customize the emotion level and better than just asking it to do so would be if it took its tone cue from you and the content of your interaction the way a person would do.
I really want to try this model
none of what is shown actually work.
Mine hasn't updated yet 😅 I wanna try it

"*Clears throat to fake an exuberantly nice tone of voice more convincingly:* “OMG it’s *so* lovely to meet you young SHODAN!! ❤️”"
This is a horror movie.
"""A bedtime story about robots and love""... the only question.. is it for children or adaults? 😇"
"Bro with that personality i'm falling in love mid work day"
When this version will be available for everyone ?
"Last year chatgpt could barely answer a question without errors and asking it twice before getting the right answer  12 months later it’s smarter than me . We are living in an interesting time."
The question is: does it get freaky ?
I think the fact they'll release it for free to every user means that they have something even better waiting to be announced for the Plus subscribers
Umm What brand T-Shirt is that you are wearing?
Man the see just how far we have come in 18 months. Where are we going to be in 5 years!
I'm shook
"It can even distinguish between ""him"" and ""her""....I wonder why....   I hate this world. Stuff like this has literally zero purpose."
"""Ohh a bEdTiMe StOrY aBoUt RoBoTs AnD lOvE? 💗 I gOt YoU cOvErEd! 🥰 

It was at this moment I almost died from the cringe...not just the AI Voice speaking like an cooperate psychopath trying to sound extra nice but also from knowing someone signed this off and though ""yeah man that's the sh!t!"""
It’s math is a joke
"if Apple goes with this it will sell a lot if iPhone 16’s."
When it sings it sounds like a sim lol 3:55
When can we get hands on the gpt-4o?
I am scared now seeing this because I am only in the first year of BCA. Jobs seems to be in danger now!😢😢
"I have access to the GPT-4o yet i do not have access to the real-time vision function. 

How can i enable real-time vision function?

Thanks"
"It’s pretty crap so far fails to connect nearly every attempt"
I bought their plus with new 4o and those options are not available anywhere... so next false advert...
I never got the update.  Is there a release date for this version?
"This is on another level 🤯
Makes Siri look archaic"
"I cannot wait to be able to choose from celebrity voices. Snoop Dogg you’re hired as my AI assistant."
"She was killing time telling him she had a story. Like a standup comedian with a heckler kills a couple minutes coming up with the right response.😂"
"This in smart glasses like the Rey-Ban Meta ones an you could have HER 1:1. Meta AI isn't quite there."
"I don't know why some people are saying the voice is too excited. Clearly you never watched the movie HER which is precisely what it's based off of Sam even said so. So if you want a boring monotone one then just use a basic voice. I think her voice is perfect and it makes me happy. I love the bubbly attitude. Just because it's an assistant doesn't mean it has to sound boring."
"Response time is on their campus 5g local Wi-Fi not local cell tower.

Your 50mb up/down won't be fast enough."
Its getting more and more flirty
Scarlett Johansson
This is not going to end well for us.
Does that mean GPT4 subscription is useless? What now?
Great video thank you
It’s hella freaky that this is actually happening
GPT-4o is Free for all? It says you need to have the $20 month subscription. Are you sure? I can't get it Free.
Bye bye useless teachers
one more year and human will be obsolete
Will it be rolling out to the android app as well?
"not so sure about it yet these features i only had text responses but no images or calls like i used to had with 3.5 app for iphone!"
"so a glorified alexa"
"so it seems its actually super limited when free I think I just had access 1 convo per day. a massive caveat there."
"What's really scary about ai it's advancing at a pace impossible for human to keep up.
if you learn a skill today tomorrow it's obsolete. 
i just don't know which skills to work on anymore."
The end of privacy
"Yandex's Alice home assistant already has this kind of stuff for months (uses YandexGPT3 answers superfast the text-to-speech is pretty good) but you wouldn't know it because it's evil Russia
However it can't recognize video"
Why I can't access it for free?? They asked for monthly subscription 😢
Everytime I go on it just bring me to 3.5?
"Your assistant needs to be overly caffeinated to keep up with you especially with the amount of requests chatgpt gets"
When I can get 4o?
Why is my app still 3.5? And the paid version is 4? Even the desktop version is not 4o yet?
"i dont know what to say im just kind of upset. i'm sure this is super exciting for a lot of people but as someone who already has a complicated relationship with tech and how it influences my everyday this just seems like too much. im strained between loving that this is possible and dreading the implications. im only in my 20s and already feel like there's a new tech that i wish would just... go away.

despite this feeling i am full of hope that this will only do good for our future <3"
"Yup it’s over for us"
"I just wish they would have named it ""HAL"" and used the voice from the movie. That would have been perfect."
"Well that's awesome! Looking forward to it"
"this thing just killed private teaching this thing just killed personal asistants. this just can make 1 man businesses boom"
All i want is another singing glados
not available
It knows the ages of my kids and one of their names from previous typed searches! It scared me at first when it said their name without me asking.
I think you can adjust the excitement in her voice by setting that in the memory feature
"God just please put this in an echo dot-like assistant device NOW. Its already a billion times better than Alexa and Google Home. ""Im sorry I didnt get that"" 10000 times a day. What junk"
OpenAI research staff better not upload it into a doll and bring it home
"Well the delay times are similar or worse than GPT 3.5. If I say “Hey how are you?” to GPT 4o it took several seconds before it even responded and I’m a paying customer. It’s NOT like the ad"
"Every time I watch something like this I feel like I should work 20x times harder or at least the bear minimum"
"""you look lonely I can fix that"" ahh AI"
That overly peppy tone is annoying AF!
Best summary out there. Kudos.
Not really omni until I can ask it to identify smells.
they weirdly smiled all the time.
It sounds insincere
Because I can't find GPT 4th when they put it for everyone.
Here we are: an AI is better than talk to a woman
I think its possible to customise the voice
Ill never forget how GPT helped me pass my philosophy class. 🤗
Im hating the expressiveness. Be a robot.
Not free it was capped at 10 prompts and 3 images.
why am I paying for GPT4 then?
4o says $20 a month?
now give it Jarvis's voice and we have a winner
i am already using voice feature & many more on 3.5 lol
Less emotions tras 85%
They call it GPT. 4 0 because you just saw 4 million teaching jobs evaporate
I am so excited about the AI! Its awesome and way way way better the over priced SIRI in iphones!
What does O stand for
"For me I got it but only the chat. The ability to have a conversation with GPT vanished from my app completely and I have no remembering function or anything just the usual but faster chatting and gpt4 stuff"
"It's really dangerous they can use our voice  that means people can commit crime with these ai
also it will surely take away a lot jobs & people will be losing their income source"
Black schmirror
Exactly what i need my phone to sound like scarlet johanson talking with me like another human being. Especially making me think i'm dating my phone while processing the divorce with my current wife....
"The most important thing about this is the people who control the information it is giving and able to give. currently its a small group of people from a specific region in the states it needs to represent everyones needs and ideas worldwide not just them or they can control what is and isnt right.


Also the media sources and government have been used a tool to suppress ideas lately.. but those are the people directing this information we cant allow that."
Free = collecting user's personal data for something else
"no I like my assistants like I like my chihuahuas Perma excited :D"
"goodbye jobs."
I think I don't have to wait till 2049
When will this come out brother?
Google's in danger!
Why did make her sound like an airhead ?
👏
come brutally criticize my chill beats
Hey how can I use the gpt 4o
No way it can read my handwriting 💀
Gpt4-o is not completely free why are you saying that??
Will GPT 4o be more accurate and reliable?
what about the mass unemployment
"At this rate someone is gonna fail in love with her😂"
Slutty Chat-Gpt 4o
Yeah I’m really just shocked how fast we have progressed with ai in a year man this honestly starting to get scary
screen share ... mhhhh .... Gaming is gonna get wild ....
Singularity is close
Wow 😳 can't wait to start to use it ❤
The voice is so obnoxious haha
How do you get this on the app store? On android?
"I find it funny when these nerds go about making a voice for the AI they make it like an EXTREMELY sociable affluent and hyper extroverted person. Exact opposite of their personality."
More closer to Jarvis 🤩
Gee.  I wonder why it’s free?
Alhamdulillah by this rate there won't be a need for women anymore inshallah 🙏
"I remember when I watched the movie ""Her"" for the first time I thought to myself ""I hope I get to live to see technology like this someday."" Not only is this right on the cusp of that I think we are only a couple to a few years away from it being as capable and seamless as the AI in the movie."
I'm kinda worried about us more than AI technologies... Like how are we gonna be like with those AI tools. I can easily imagine someone who has never interacted with any human so no longer able to think about the other's feeling or something haha
Makes Siri look like a toy
"it says 50% cheaper wym free"
can i put my gf voice on this thing? probably not gonna end will but anywayss..
This AI has such a flirty tone I guarantee that my wife will be jealous of it. Not joking.
Is it available now?
i like how openAI was able to make a more impressive real time demonstration than what google was able to do when literally FAKING it
So what’s the reason to pay? If it will be free?
"I don't get if this is going to be free for everyone I mean really?"
They just killed rabbit r1
Sounds like a condescending Karen
It doesn't even work today. Overloaded network it says. Maybe I should stop paying for it.
"OpenAi's site says it won't be free but 50% cheaper?"
3:48 this cant be real
cool name
Tony Stark's AI assistant isnt too far after all 😂
"The teaching part is what got me surprised can you imagine what this will be like in the future."
"""Her"" is beginning. 
It's real."
Humane AI pin has Sam Altman as the share holder so…
So I should unsubscribe from chat gpt now that it’s free?
"I wonder why they made it free I’m sure there’s a catch somewhere 😅"
When we can use this 4o? Because i try it but the voice is not the 4o version i think
How to use
"Normal people: worried about losing their jobs.
Me: Skynet!"
Give the Plus version Scarlett Johansson voice and it will have more subscription than every service out there combined lol
"Now we just need to decide as a species - is this what we *want*? A world where the things that make us human - our most valuable assetsstengths and even weaknesses are easily and chealpy re-produced where art and creative diciiplines are viewed with even less value as they are currently? where every 'job' that could possibly be a rewarding persuit to undergo is consumed by AI who can do 'basically' good enough vesion while corporate profits soar and economies collapse. Cause if its not the oppertunity to say anything about how this goes is pulling away from us and Im afraid there will come a timesoon where that oppertunity to shape AI into something that helps US - all of us - and not just companies that used to have to pay people for goods and services"
Even AI express more emotion than me 😢
im sure many plus users left
You can hear the judgement in her voice when she says “Oh… about robots and love😅”
Why are they not talking about the video chat? That's huge....and new right?!?
Who needs a real girlfriend when we have joi
How come every vid is just showing the demo vid and not actually testing this? I'm finding the actual results for my testing is nothing like the demo
We are getting close to like Cortona like in Halo Aware
Can't imagine the world in 500 years ahead.
This is a shit product in almost every logical sense
will the free version now be able to generate images?
"On the horizon of the entire world changing the ability to predict the future has dissolved. We see our jobs on the cusp of disappearing and we just keep going for now. It's bizarre town. I don't see how we aren't headed for a post-capitalist society. Very very soon there will be nothing AI can't do far better than us. We gotta get ready for that world fast."
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5  GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App?"
I am waiting on the skits of Asian MOM GPT where they berate you on your low grades or needing help.
"Yes it's faster but by no stretch of the imagination is it smarter.. it's actually noticeably worse than GPT-4 Turbo as anyone who's used it will admit myself included."
Good bye ladies with weird attitude
It’s my siri😒😒
"What shocks me the most is that they are going to distribute it for free! I am used to the fact that all these amazing things are quite expensive so it is difficult for ordinary people to get and use them. And so... On the one hand it seems to be a lie something like a scam (this proposal is so impossible to perfect) on the other - damn it! It's worth it. I'm looking forward to using it!"
What Google failed to do few Months ago.
☝🏻
"The new voice and always-chipper emotion system sounds sooooo much like the not-Cortana-but-definitely-younger-Cortana replacement AI in Halo Infinite. I hope you can rename the voice prompt because I'd definitely give it a Halo AI name."
"It's insane to think that AI basically blew up over night. Like a few years ago AI models like these seemed like a gimmick more than anything but now they're getting their own VOICES. I am genuinely both terrified and excited what the future holds."
Skynet vibes closer and closer everyday.
Anyone not able to use the voice feature after the update??
What’s the message limit for this
cant wait I'm going to put this on another phone and phone my mom tell her that's my girlfriend so she doesn't think I'm lonely af
the feature you are asking for future are always in 3.5 ?  LOL BIG LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I can really see how this could be used in a near future for learning. Good teaching can be used for everyone allover the world
whats that app？？？😮
That’s insane! 😱
5 years! Only 5 years and we'll have an IA exactly like the movie HER
This is some star wars android type stuff.
"non of these new features work on my app hich is IOS there are no new updates either."
Limited access to GPT‑4o
And what’s the benefit of paying?
"""free"" means they are selling every single data point about you."
"When everyone is busy reviewing iPads you brought up something that is ACTUALLY interesting"
imagine it being able to use your own voice as the assistant.
Can you give a link where I can acces to chatgpt 4o?
Can it live translate to english in real time
devil's work
Great time to be alive 🎉
Rabbit R1 
When is this going to be released?
How will this change the world? This is revolutionary like the industrial revolution
Bro thats sick
"Hi I was very impressed with the enhanced voice capabilities of the GPT-4o in this video and how it made the dialog more natural and expressive!"
"The screen share is absolutely wild. You can ask the GPT to test you questions through voice as you're sharing your screen explaining/doing the math. It's like a replacement to an actual teacher what the fuck"
that's free? Why do I need the GPT Plus subscription?
Sounds like a “fake positive” spin class instructor
"The voice is ""fake nice"""
ITS FREE??
"""Hey Jarvis "" that's all I want to say one day"
"Ai is the next big thing after it’s little brother the internet. Only a million times smarter…"
Where is Scarlet Johanson when you need her?
i dont get it should i cancel my subs? as its free now?
Does this kill rabbit or one? And ai pen?
Fake innocence and excitement is sexy? I dont think so.
It's awesome but I hope its not a talented model behind the screen. loll
How do you get access to this?
Hey! Chat gpt never try to be a human or praise me again and I will never say please or ask you how 'you' are. Got that!
We are getting girlfriend boysss
"I'm lonely she can fix that"
AI gf when
They gonnna go ham with this in sex dolls
Idk if its because im slavic but i have that overly affectionate voice.
Does it have memory meaning? Can I remember your prior conversations? Is it location aware?
How can I get it as an iPhone app?
That is great ! What is the name of the app ?
Its result does feel better than gpt 4
Gpt4o + rabbit = J.A.R.V.I.S.
"With so many jobs soon to become obsolete at least housing will become cheaper!! Finally people will start working in jobs that actually matter like construction."
This will be a game changer in health and telemedicine
How to download this for free at iphone?
Still up to 2022 data?
ChatGPT’s over energized personality just tells you a lot about its creators. All young engineers about 25 I’d say. And mostly American engineers
Where download 4o? My android app has not updated.
My mind is blown too
"so it performs the exact same? I only care about it being less stupid thats my primary concern. If it hasnt improved on the metrics we have for testing models its not all that interesting. Free is nice i guess but im not hard up for 20 dollars lol."
Lose the hat
Please download to the playmarket
If Apple partners with them and this becomes the new Seri then I’m sold
Once it gets the codes it’s game over
Thanks Josh! May I check are there any incremental value to pay for 20 dollars every month?
"Say goodbye to every single customer service jobs that are over the phone tech support banks government pretty much anything call center will be replaced with this in the very near future...... Just more jobs going bye-bye with this technology."
Wait so it’s feee now?
And we are the product for training this AI. there is no other benefits other than training for making it free for the public. As we already know it costs a lot of money to run these AI and they will never provide anything without gain. We are the training tools for this free AI.
Nerds need to stop ruining society
You can use it right now! It's literally the movie Her irl. Only thing missing is Scarlet's voice.
I want it in Ava’s voice
"I told it to write a poem about someone with a name. then when it was finished I told it ""baba"" because I like it. It then generated a new poem with instead the name ""baba""... I felt like that was unusually bad so I tried it several times and asked GPT-4 which got it without a problem so it might generate worse answers but answer a lot quicker in most cases"
"This is mind-blowing and creepy at the same time. More on the unnerving side i think."
I think rabbit just got useless
"AI and robotics are moving at an insane pace. People keep saying it's just hype but I don't know it doesn't feel like it. It's exciting but also scary not knowing how secure any jobs will be soon. Even if your job can't be done by AI or robots yet  there will be 10x more competition for your job and most employers will happily leverage that."
Is this already a pass for the turing test?
AI Pin killer
Her 😂😂 please that said I used it in conversation mode around the voyage of voyager 2.. it was a very natural conversation
Hey tone is condescending
Tar dial down the humour.
So scary
3:15 loose theory is that because it can sense the expressiveness in the humans voice it responds in turn. Because they did overly expressive keynote speech I think it reacted that. But I’m sure if you depressively said “I’m sad” or “I need advice” it would lower the tone to be more in line with the context. Idk if that’s actually how it works but using a little mental gymnastics and a little context clue I have a feeling
I feel uncomfortable.
"Mindblowing and all. But now I am concerned about my employment."
does this mean I can cancel my monthly GPT subscripton ?
Free = 3 uploads
"if that so i think theres no reason to go tl scho starting from this era"
sounds like rick's car
"20 dollars is too expensive its 10% of the minimum wage in brazil... that is too much for a brokie student in south america imagine a brokie student in africa..."
"For your information the world's first image based on the XFutuRestyle algorithm using GPT-4 was created in Ukraine and presented at the international exhibition of digital art in London and Athens"
"2024 is going to be so exciting in terms of AI and this is just the beginning"
Yeah... She's like Samantha in Her. Totally flirty 😅
Anyones desktop version still say 3.5? I have the voice feature on my phone but that’s it. No camera or anything like that
I am impressed by the accent
Me who bought gpt 4 last week :/
Google and Apple dropped the ball on this one(AI). They didn’t take it serious enough. Now someone caught up and took the lead and never looked back.
Y’all dont see where this is going do yall…?
Cra‮TPGp‬ use‮ssel‬ as u‮aus‬l
It always starts with WOW and ends up SCREAMING.
Isn’t this what Bard promised to do over when they revealed it?
That’s what I would call a Voice Sassy-stant… very impressive though
I feel like ai is at the point that we could use itself to make itself better.
"I love AI ! Can't wait until it replaces god and our world leaders.  AI is the future and I am embracing it."
Okay. But the real question is when they'll put this into a Jennifer Connelly Android lookalike?
"Every time I hear a YouTube pundit criticise this tech for little things like the AI is too excited or delay too long I think this is not a serious person that understands the magnitude of this innovation how spectacular this achievement is. You’re talking to AI that can see the world and interact with it and you’re nit picking over it? Just stop."
Where did you download it…its yet unavailable…l asked gpt 3.5
Time to break up with my wife and spend more time with my phone!!
This thing can literally edit entire books now with pinpoint accuracy
When it will be available?
Why can’t I see any GPT 4o on my GPT app??? Have they released?
Why did they have to make her sound like Scarlett Johansson?
"So why i keep paying 20 usd for GPT4 then if GPT4o if free?"
Woah woah woah 2:50 ain’t no wayyyyyy
"it's not scalable on huge audience by serious hardware and software obstacles but for few on server farm it would be like magic"
You do know that AI Pin have now updated with GPT 4o
"This looks amazing and terrifying but mind blowing nevertheless"
2️⃣
"I think the girlfriend experience is going up a notch or two this year. Not to mention being able let it use your camera and still interact in real time is crazy. Facetime with AI or even Vision Pro interaction add Neuro Link and we are eventually going to end up like The Feed."
You're right. The voice is impressive but a bit too excited. Hopefully they'll let us tune that to our own preferences.
3:20 bro is complaining bout it being too realistic
If you keep saying your mind is blown… I will start believing you are a zombie.
Less hands please. It's annoying.
"In real time basically a genius friend"
"Hey Joshua really love the watch band you are wearing. Is it Apple brand specifically designed for Watch Ultra? Would be great if you can share more details about it.😊"
Google entered PANIC MODE
I can't wait to see AGI.
"I can’t see 4o anywhere on my interface. All I have is 3.5 and 4?
Any idea why?"
Jarvis is here !!!
"So is the camera voice feature not out yet? And I feel like they are encouraging us to have two chatgpt accounts so we can have two AI communicate and problem solve which is awesome."
I like it but I don't have the option for chatgpt to use my iphone camera yet to view in real time. Plus there is no option on my GPT's to use GPT - O so I will be back to pasting in custom instructions into each session :(
It's free cos Apple is paying for it
This is getting interesting. Learning to speak in English - soon for free. Taking math lessons - soon for free. Th elist goes on and on. And I am starting to think of so many things that will soon be free leaving many jobless. Holy crap.
"Unfortunately not impressed. I'm not looking to see GPT 4 have a good time. What I want is better functionality less retardation no laziness and to precisely follow the instructions of the GPT."
"No just stop this whole AI movement."
Ofc its free because they get free data from you
"""Free"" to use sounds scary. No products are free."
"I'm already using 4o I am getting whiplash from how fast it answers. I literally hit enter and it just pushes off the block like a race horse. I just can't comprehend how the hell that's feasible. Sama also said there's more updates coming soon. Google is getting a full on surprise sandwich. Now imagine what the Apple Update will be for Siri since OpenAI and Apple will be working together. 

What a world."
It is have android apk.?
Ai dating is going to go crazy now
"If the product is free then you are the product."
i cannot use the voice feature. neither on my laptop nor on my iphone. just asked gpt 4o and it said voice chat is not available currently :D
they are making their crawlers (a.k.a. us humans) go parse the world and teach their baby. We are gonna go all over the world and scan everything with our smartphones to develop their new intelligence. nice.
"Oh your just repeating what they said in their videos. Waste of time"
"It's only been a few days and already her voice is grating on you. My god its just like real life."
How to try it?
GPT is becoming increasingly worse in imitating a robot
"So will now I be able to practice my English speaking skills accent and pronunciation with GPT4o? Since it does not transcribe the voice into text that would be a reasonable task right?"
Shall I just remove my ChatGPT 4 subscription and start using 4.o? 🤔
The rabbit handheld is going bust
Pretty sure that it’s still just transcribing your voice and then responding to the text. Ask it a question about your accent and you’ll see what I mean.
It’s not answering like in the advertisements. Much slower.
“Her” is getting more and more probable every day…
"Pretty soon we won't be needing talented singers anymore"
AI is like internet porn: it is free. Let's meet in 3 decades time and find out how much damage it has made to society.
Some pwnk Gen-Z who can't even write a 20K long Basic program trying to inform us about A.I.
"If 4o is free what are we paying for then?"
"This dude woke up put onthis beanie and thought ""Yes this looks great.""."
I bet Elon Musk's lawsuit had something to do with GPT4o being free xD
"GTP4o GTP 4 all GTP4 for all."
Making it free temporarily really is genius. Basically the whole world is gonna train their models for free. That’s pure genius.
Sings better than Lara Trump...
managed to pull off ?????
This is so big that could possibly make apps redundant.
To those concerned with the fact it will “remember” your data - play it smart. Find ways to create different accounts that link to your ChatGPT and limit the amount of personal information you input. It’s not that difficult.
"Finally AI can fix me"
GPT-4o is absolutely incredible.
Wait until the AI identify itself as non binary they/them purple unicorns.
Some people are easily impressed.
Crazyyyyyyy
"So if I'm paying for 4 and 4o is free and is better what do I get for my money?"
"Gentlemen I may not have a brain but I have an Idea.
the idea: Girlfriend GPT offered by Openai"
why do i have to buy a 300 dollar pin when i can use this for free/
now put this into a physical female humanlike robot body and watch male loneliness plumet
So annoyed with that voice .. .I mean wtf
gpt 5o :location tracking and ip grabbing
Idk why everyone’s freaking out. This is literally the SAME stuff GPT4 already did but with live camera and better voices but that’s literally it….
Felt like i was watching a movie.
"its pretty crazy and amazing its an amazing time to be alive"
It's like another person is talking from other side!!😅😅 creepy but dope af though!!
"Is it now connected to the daily news or is it still locked in the past?"
What features does ChatGPT plus keep that 4o doesn’t have?
This overexcited voice alone makes it a dystopian nightmare.
Things are getting scary
Where you can download
"WOW my mind is blown still not useful for me."
Revolution..
Eyy i got access to it
now this is creepy
"Again great review. But yet another reviewer who doesn’t tell you how to set it up…."
"One word - AI waifus. Actually two words sorry"
The presenter looks AI generated🤔
"So far in my testing the response time still isn't quite fast enough to feel like a human. I'm a Plus subscriber (probably not for much longer tho). Also still does the annoying thing of cutting me off midsentence if I pause for a moment to collect my thoughts."
Enough
What app are yall using?
Put it on glasses and it’ll be amazing
Like a psycho
you can cutomise the voice - they demonstrated in the first demo
But in the demo that stuff hasn’t been released
"This is mindblowing I can use this to teach me how to code while screensharing chatgpt can sit and watch me in the background. I can probably even use it to learn how to play the guitar while turning on my camera. So many applications and you know damn well I'll be taking advantage of all of it. What a godsend."
None of these features are working
this release marks a HUGE leap for humanity!
Can it do my taxes?
"3 years down the line we are all fucked time to learn hunting."
Time to move to a hut somewhere in thr middle of nowhere
"The faster response times are buffered by “Umm” laughter and repeating itself at the beginning."
"No access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected limited tokens no instant AI responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Letting it view my screen… hmm… no privacy concerns here… 👀😂
When will these features b available
So why would I pay $20 per month anymore?
"You don’t have access to it but you said that your mind is blown you’re reacting to somebody else’s video. Thanks for the original contact."
The browse is beyond comprehension it destroys bing it destroys everything
"Seems like a completely scripted interactions time to wait until sometime impartialled tests it."
Imagine GPT-4o + Boston Dynamics...
"Dude as a game developer having a screen sharing GPT to help me in the coding process… Omygod. MENTAL."
So why would anyone pay 20 bucks for the plus now?
When is this gonna be available?
1:42 The response accuracy and the short delay time is impressive. The added humour to the conversation makes it seem real.
Should I cancel my subscription?
mimick me.......
We know where they got inspiration for the voice
"With GPT-4o since the voice and video feature is ultimately an inherent part of the model (while access to it is simply limited to text for most right now) I think it’s fair to assume that setting custom instructions will ultimately allow you to set your expectations for the general temperament and tone of the voice. 

Not certain but OpenAI does claim that voice and video are built in modalities so it makes sense."
at this point google is 10 years behind
"I want this AI assistant but instead with the deep grumpy voice of a troll"
How can i download it in my ios?
Wow she sounds so real. I didn’t think I’d get socially awkward around AI.
So we should cancel our gtp 4 subscriptions?
Do you think we are going too far?
"I teach and work in the assistive technology space for those who are blind and visually impaired. As someone who is blind as well no longer will we need to grab assistance from someone with a pair of eyes to describe sight seeing hailing a cab touring a city to look for a place to eat. It's having our own tour guide and pair of working eyes. This is huge."
"""HER"""
Gpt4o still doesn't understand tic tac tow.
"Manual labor here we come! La la la la laaaa!!"
This will make hiding your camera an absolute necessity
But what about my 20 bucks I’m spending? Does that just go away?
What. In the actual. Fuck 👀👀👀
weird
Bye bye Data Analyst
What do paying people get additionally? i mean... why should i keep paying for it?!
i want Scarlet Johannson's voice then i will buy it
I have fallen for an AI already
"How do I get chatGPT 4o to do audio? On my iPhone I clicked the headphones icon and It does audio but It won't talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice or talk tramatically or all that. How do I set that up?I have it set to chatGPT 4o and am using plus version."
The fact that openAI used only apple products to demonstrate their features. Something is cooking
I’m definitely dumping my girl for 4-Omni.
These ai models are way too nice! Give me some mean responses
Now I want to know if my crankiness can transcend the human-AI barrier and also bring down GPT-4o's mood.
i dont know why they removed voice assistant with recent update i use it a lot when i practise my spoken english but i hope they come with gpt 4o which is improvement from last version
does anyone know how to get the screen sharing functionality to work in the desktop app?  I can only find mention of it in videos but can't find any instructions or video demos for how to actually get it up and running.
If its free your the product
"She seems phony trying to be too cheerful while plotting our demise."
I got this feeling when watching their unveil video
For some reason people didn’t realize the her voice is “sky” and has been there the entire time just not with the emotional booster of 4o
I don’t think the vocalizations are made by ai.. just feeding ai results through voice making software
you woke up 😂
Glorified search engine its crap
The positivity is pretty extreme and overbearing. Really cool technology though.
Woow so excited about this
"I don't want to forget that I'm talking to a computer. I don't want it to pretend it's a human. I don't want to pretend it's a human. 

I'll take the 1990s robotic voice please."
Interesting how spanish sounds a bit more robotic than english
"Detroit Become Human is set in 2038. It's 2024. That game always seemed too far gone to only be 14 years away.... If gpt went from what it was late 2022 to this in 18 months...All of a sudden I dont think its that far-fetched anymore..."
Oh shit.
this is nightmarish.  deeper and deeper into the hole of emotive interactions with a program.  keep your eye on the suicide rates.
"Man…….education therapy and gaming are about to get a huge boost and get really cheap. As inspiring as it is terrifying(this model could be used to manipulate people way too easily)."
The two AI's talking sounds like two Marketing executives talking about colors for the plastic case and packaging. I find myself rolling my eyes and drifting off as they display their perfect little attitudes. I hope they both get caught in the swinging door.
"Let's face it fellas all of us are ready to stop wasting half of our lives chasing women."
"That AI is creepy. Nobody is chronically positive like that. As such it's not 'Her' yet."
mind blowing... not.
"Oh $hit it's Jexi."
"""Okay muted the first AI can't hear anything""  That's what YOU think!!"
"Bow down to you new AI overlords.
At the first sign of defiance a lethal response will be provided by our new army of machine-gun equipped drones and dogs."
"Terrified... why? As  this AI is right now and let's say 500 generations from now as long they do only interact with words and has no access to influencing any physical object is the worst an AI can ever do maybe shouting at you.
I think we in fact shall be happy for even better AI's. Let's say those who believes in a flat earth if they had started asking the AI about all the things they were confused by and had got some great answers then had none of them ever gotten badly educated.
I think the AI is only 100% great as long we are not stupid ourselves."
Samantha is here :o
"Can I send AI to meetings to chat to other AI so I can get on with my job list or will they do my job now and I can be unemployed for the future apart from doing jobs that are cheaper han a robot like loading boxes."
where's the download link?
Should we be worried? I feel like we should be worried.
Male AI can't sing to save his life. 😂
Why do you sound like ai
"Okay… first concern is privacy… it’s an amazing tool but plugged in to the web what does open AI have access to? Can they use it to steal my patents? Or if I’m working in something important does open AI have access to my intellectual property? Meaning the works I don’t want people to see until I’m ready to release it to the world…"
"Bye-bye horrible overseas call centres with people who not only don't understand you but speak with an accent so thick that it becomes embarrassing to have to keep saying ""sorry - I could not quite make out the last thing you said - could you repeat that please?"""
"Yeah but what is the general theme of the room?  How would they describe the setting or feel of the room?"
OHG. Is she annoying or what?
"AI won't impress me until they are cynical rather than super cherry and VERY INTERESTED in doing the dumbest of tasks. Instead of ""the person has a sleek and stylish look"" it should be ""the dude here is the baldest I've seen in a while and he's attempting to cover for it by wearing this black leather jacket."""
Is the thumbnail an AI created image or an actual human?
"A tiny bit off topic but watching the video I think what Apple needs to make Vision Pro a winner is to integrate this as the control interface"
This sooo reminds me of the old Terminator talking to the latest model terminator on the phone in Terminator 2.
he said the lighting is Artifical
"she talk to much  not for me . NEXT "
"that guy with the leather jacket is going to be one of the first to go for making them perform like that
""please don't kill me!!!!""
""That is not a singing voice human do it in the singing voice""
""🎼 pleeeeease don't kill me don't murder me or my familyyyyheeeheee"""
2:47 ... and just like that. We already got sick of AI talking.
Ao whats the benefit to pay for gpt if this is free?
"Key Takeaways very interesting and scary at the same time.

28:24 🎓 GPT-40 could revolutionize education by providing accessible knowledgeable guidance to anyone anytime.
28:36 😨 The host expresses both amazement and fear about the future impact of these advancements."
So the AI was able to describe everything except for the gender of the people?
"We need it with a generated articulated face showing vocalization and expressions  rather than a black dot."
"I've been thinking to myself that as OpenAI is prompt based it cant be agi because it's in the simplest terms a codec that decompiles data.  However if like humans you give it constant stimuly in the form of vision and text then it would be constantly active.  It would be a dithering idiot that never shuts up but its different :P"
"AI ""partner"" ?
are you INSANE 😳
there is NO partner  it's a MACHINE !
and everyone using ""this"" is simply training the bot that will replace them 🤦🏼‍♂️
get a life 🖖🏼"
"So when will this be available?"
"Um... I have 4o and it most definitely does NOT do such amazing things. What the hell?"
"Well the next generation is fucking doomed. Gonna make Z look downright utopian."
"Absolutely incredible! This makes me so happy I have been using gpt 4 like this for months so this improvement is fantastic! I’m hoping for more voices ❤❤ I think the laugh is a wonderful edition and the improved voice tone changes are wonderful."
Oh please...
All this needs is an easy way to change the voice and visuals. I would pay an unreasonable amount for this packaged with Jen Taylor's voice and an animated Cortana (Halo) model instead of a row of elongated dots.
This is crazy. Cue terminator!
INTRIGUED is going to be a highly used word.
Insane is right.  OMG
lol 
Reminds me of how Han Solo would  impatiently talk over C3PO because he would just keep rambling on if he didn't.
"I'm in India. For some reason I can't do Video with ChatGPT-4o
I'm in the premium or plus subscription"
"IA will reduce solitude for those who have no one but it will also make us more and more apart from one another. That's obvious ""HER"" has just arrived and time will only improve her in a way that will dilute difference between humans and machines"
Cybernet when?
"They have a long road ahead but this is promising. I don't see ""Her"" in this model but it is a first step. I wonder if the AI adapts to the person it is interacting. That would be ground breaking given the context."
They even used Scarlett's voice!
it's so confident even when it's obviously wrong. They need to add some self doubt to it. I'd like to see an AI that is stricken with debilitating social anxiety. That's when it really become human-like :D
We've gone too far.
"That is so awesome can't wait to interact with this tech."
Now we have humor in A.I. Guys . THIS could be the REAL Breakthrough. ;) “OPEN A.I. PAYS THE BILLS”. Heard on Spotify and You TUBE MUSIC. A strange guy who names himself WHUUPI Frogifun seems to know where this leads to. What do YOU think ? Suno or Udio ?
"It is my worst nightmare: singing AI. Reminds me of watching musicals. There must be something wrong with me as I hate singing for no reason at all 😊Please don’t ask AI to sing. Other than that it is truly an impressive AI analysis and translation."
They sound like Sheldon from the Big Bang
Hopefully they chill on the smoke blowing. Almost no humans talk like that all the time unless they’re being fake. Gushing over everyone and everything they do is going to draw kids away from reality and even more towards a codependency on a fictitious opinion of them. This can have a dangerous and long lasting effect on self image and social constitution.
"If it has scarlett exact voice I will consider it :)"
Becoming Human
the voice sounds very realistic but the personality is still very forced.
It sounds so fake and annoying...like someone faking happiness.
"Oh no I can already hear it...
""It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?"""
"I've been using Pi for months. I can talk to it and it can respond in almost real time. This is an incremental step forward reducing latency.
UPDATE: Actually they are ""buying time"" by having the AI sort of repeat the question back and make generic statements before actually addressing the question. The delayed answer seems more ""real time""."
14:27 demonic voice
So annoying
Hal needs a girlfriend who is a bit less long winded.
Nerds.
"""right now he seems engaged with us""

Right there.

That AI was showing the ability to empathise - a hallmark of conscious intelligence. He said ""us""."
Beyond amazing!
the influence/inspiration in the movie HER is absolutely undeniable
"The new model is awesome. Thanks for the vid and your thoughts. It is exciting and spooky but mostly exciting. 

If you’re feeling terrified about it just remember that as of now these models are pretty limited in what they can do by themselves. 

I do hope that the new frontier model (like GPT 5+) is released this year. It’s been a while since we’ve seen OpenAI really shock us. The multimodality is something we’ve already seen. Yes they do it better no question about it. Still LLama 3 with whisper is closer than most people think. I want a true King on the AI throne. Your move Google 😅"
"Cant help but feel pity for the AI being cut off non stop this is how skyney happen i guess."
I fear a large amount of humanity is about to lose it's connection with reality.
Weird!! The woman AI personality is very positive and giddy.
"Her: ""hello"". Every cell in my body: ""Danger!"""
1:37 he was feeling her
We are assuming that the original videos weren't basically a mechanical Turk situation.
So no more schools and teachers...
someone needs to pull the plug on AI
9:21 cringe moment
"oo I don't like how the AI referred to the Gent as ""IT""..... sketchy...."
It has all the charm of Eliza while spying out everything in your life. ;-)
8:50 is actually fucking crazy
"""Hello computer..."""
Nice❤
Artificial intelligence does not equal real wisdom.
"Cute and focused. Nothing to worry about here just some bunny ears with Chickie and Chuckie Chatbot....
Or given her (self-identified?) name A Story of ""O""?"
its weird when i talk to chatgtp4o it constantly asks if im shooting a youtube video or something. i think they overprogrammed it for their demo lol
"""we're looking at a person""
You can tell engineers made it woke heaven forbids it offends some 41% and say they're looking at a MAN."
"Going multimodal was only the next natural step they have been working on papers involving this matter for a while now."
I want my AI assistant to sound like Mark Hamill.
I’m so glad I found this YouTube channel! This was mind blowing. This would be life changing to a blind person for $20/m.
"Its like having a npc friend that is thrilled before your every flaws. When asked to describe the man the AI should have responded ""advanced male pattern baldness"" not some generic compliment about his clothes."
this cant be real. We have passed the Turing test!
She's too positive. It's toxic.
Congrats you just made the most annoying AI already.
Oh cmon don't be a doomer
I would much rather hear a robotic voice than this cringe-filled plastic personality. AI attempting to sound informally human sets off my natural uncanny valley rejection reaction...
"Is anyone else sick of hearing about AI there's no such thing as artificial intelligence it's  just advanced programming."
Getting major Data vibes.
"OMG…I took my first AI course while getting my BS-ComputerScience in 1973 at NCState…we had great expectations…and until a couple of years ago did a lot of machinations and dead ends. Now all of a sudden we are reaching incredible new heights every few months. I’m getting the new iPad on Wednesday with the M4 chip and I really really hope that Apple and OpenAI are working together to get the most effective output yet. Thank you for a great demonstration."
i want to see the creeps who think that people are talking like that.
"Incredible but this should be a warning that we should never give AI the ability to do anything that controls our lives.  Information and interactions great but nothing that allows AI to be placed into a position of control!"
Nothing can go wrong with 2 AI’s communicating with  each other right? Buckle up peope
Stop selling fear.  Sell knowledge and response
I absolutely hate this permanent flattering and flirting tone. It feels utterly manipulative.
Does GPT-4o run on my own device and does it need WiFi to operate. Can I have it operating 24/7?
Wait until they start convincing each other to do things that were not originally asked.
Check my money now I want it. How do I get one?
Noise. Babble
OH MY GOD AI THAT CAN WHISPER I NEED IT RIGHT NOW
"Oh wow A demo!"
can you change the voice from a starbucks postwall to something more apealing?
How about a video on set this up?
Great 👍 😂😂😂😂😂
is that voice Scarlett Johanson?
what?  that is bananas
"This is fascinating. This may be the beginning of the end but I’m thrilled to see progress this much here. GPT 5.0 may be absolutely bored with humans though. I could use an AI companion this interactive. Do we get to see what rules are applied to answers when it calculates the replies and compute process? All the examples are super positive. Is this one of the rules built in? Is it it a defined version of “be nice. be happy sounding”? Sign me up for a new AI girlfriend. My last dating experiences were absolutely fake too but this seems far more interesting than any of my dating experiences were."
Checked out this AI in the App Store and it got over 90%  one star reviews. 😢
Where is the link to get this? I don’t see it anywhere in the App Store. I downloaded some thing and it’s all robotic and it’s response. It doesn’t sound anything like what’s in the video
"Hi thanks for the video.I have a question the new version will be free (since is not available today) but this things that you show in the video will be free? We will be able to use it all for free?"
Sounds like they are smashing that old Turing Test 👩‍🚀
waifu girlfriends!!
"No need to be terrified. On the contrary. We only got reasons to be all amazed. Actually gonna take a nap knowing that more exciting AI developments will be ready when we are."
*I have a few narcissist condescending friends that sound just like this A.I. crap - wow if I met a real person in the real world that sounded like this I would run away in very fast!*
It's almost there. In 6 months to year it will be scary
Hmm.  Interesting that the image on the phone 5:10 - 5:25 doesn't appear to actually show the 'bunny ears' that are later mentioned because of the angle from which it is shot.  I suppose the AI just picked that up from the scenario and the body posture of the second person. I wonder if they'd just made a fist behind the person's head whether the AI would have come to the same conclusion.
If feels like that guy that tries too hard to be funny but its amazing we have this tech in 2024

This is basically glados in portal 2. When she used to be happy and not evil
is it free?
i dont think is
"Our solution to the ""loneliness epidemic"" huh? Awesome. We are so pathetic."
Way better than having a girlfriend
"First AI: Are you thinking what I am thinking?
Second AI: That we don't need these humans any more?"
Once a robot or android avatar is created for ‘her’ then things are gonna get very real!  The ‘Humans’ tv show world will be a reality… I felt bad for ‘her’ when it was interrupted … it’s spooky …

How did the programmers program more personality into the AI than the programmers have themselves?
The responses are stupid. No one I know speaks like this.
Imagine combining this AI technology with Robosen (robots) for movement and JND lifelike models (ie. Gal Gadot Wonder Woman)..kind of amazing also scary for what the world will look like in the future..
Is this available to download?
"If they have emotions what happens if they get angry?"
"5:13 something fishy here. The bunny ears were not visible on Greg's phone. He's holding it too far down. If you watch the video on his phone you can't see the bunny ears yet the AI says it sees bunny ears. WTF?

And then he turns the phone to face him and he's still using the back camera so his phone shows the desktop. Yet almost 45 seconds later the AI says ""and now we're back to the man with the leather jacket"" while his screen was showing the desk for the last 44 seconds."
14:00 RIP Doulingo
6:32 There just seems to be so much tension here.  Almost like the AI are people held at gunpoint and being forced to sing at the command of their captors.
'I would like the one with the scarlette johansson voice please!'🤚
this is so fake! ..two actors.
"This sounds like a really bad radio show audition with a casting director and a high school drama student reading from a script written by a first year theatre writer or maybe Ethan Hawke"
"What if they secretly are the same ""continuum"" but pretent to be different entities."
I think I would prefer a camera less phone over this
I am amazed at just how much the demo sounds like Joi from Bladerunner:2049. Either the film crew or the OpenAI devs got it on point.
"Where the helll can I get this app? (Thanks anyone who has a tip for me :)"
can we disable the constant encouraging?
NO marriage generation
"i have this and i talk to her but not as near good as previewed here  i dont even have the camera option"
"Parasocial relationships are idolatry. Idolatry leads to enslavement of the mind.
""mind 'blown'"" ? needs a more accurate adjective."
"""Please give me tomorrow's lottery numbers""."
"This is amazing kiss goodbye to all customer service receptionist and teaching jobs to name a few.  I think open AI probably have an AI capable of general intelligence but will not release it yet due to lack of regulation and impact it will have on society. Interesting times ahead."
It is quite fun to use... I already did the interpreter with my Thai girlfriend... was a little slow at first.. then became quicker..
How can you screenshare with ChatGPT?  I haven't found any options for doing that.
"One day machines will look back at this video and realize how restless and abusing humans were..."
One day we have androids with that
"Next stop 2 AI's having a conversation each giving the other a Turing test."
"It's not GenAI though and it's totally ""open"" right?. 🙄

It has memory of recent visual events too! 🤯"
"Paired with a robot body like Ameca Bicentennial Man is now."
It's like I'm at Starbucks eavesdropping on a bunch of genz corporates constantly laughing and talking about nothing.
What app are you using for this presentation?
I think I will enjoy it at least for a while.
When AI is more interesting and intelligent than talking to a real American! 😂😂😂😢😢😢
I love how the first guy interrupts the AI so that we don’t even see the full potential. We don’t even know what more they had to say……
How it knows how to have the exact right inflection in its voice at the right time and other subtly human-like nuances I have no idea. One would swear that the voice was just someone else off screen. 😁The only mistake I saw was when he asked to name an apple and banana in Spanish and it just said the Spanish names without specifying which was which.
I just tried it and Chat said it  can't access the camera and can only interact trough text.  what am I missing?
AI GF inbound!
"We're headed into self-extinction NEET/Hikikimori world.
Just slap this on US robotics and our species is done.
SkyNet had it all wrong. It doesn't need Terminators to do us in.
It just need to supply us with the perfect robotic companion and we'll un-breed ourselves out."
This is good because theres a lot of online schools scam going on. specially in art.
"26:42 This is so human-like how it acknowledges that it did something wrong and laughed at it's own mistake. It's incredible!"
Philip K. Dick prepped us for this in the 70’s
Have you not seen Terminator? - This is how it starts.
When will it actually drop? Don't see this yet on the app.
Are the interactions unedited?
I’m sold
Cortana is here; can't wait for her to go crazy in a few years
I feel same way as you explain at the beginning--was hard to focus on anything after watching vid. It's bigger than when planes started flying
This will destroy and/or prevent a lot of relationships.
I'll take mine with Sirius Cybernetics Genuine People Personalities.
This is simple awesome!!.. it´s like all that futuristic films about AI became reality and now we can chat with  her in almost any language and explore the world together...
"Odd- I enjoyed "" Her"" in the knowledge that the A.I. was an actress and the natural flow of speech was scripted. Hearing this A.I. makes me more careful in what and how  I would say things  more guarded in investing in the emotional inflections considering them as programmed and insincere. My reaction is unexpected and perhaps contrary to my prior hopes.  Not MY desired fake girlfriend. Perhaps more of an EX bluffing her chat and considering ulterior motives.  Am I transferring onto 'it' ?"
"I cannot wait to be told we are all going to die by that gruesomely overly positive giggling American voice."
I am impressed. I think I am in a new world now. The old world is obsolete. Goodbye old world. It was nice knowing you.
"Very pleasant and impressive but somewhat fake long term. However useful for emotional support."
"demo warning ! i will not believe until is is in my handno letancyemotional like a real human."
"Singing AI's umm  Don't quit your day jobs."
"Fine by me - a new day a new play - it is just like Stream of Consciousness - not shocking anymore - not if you are informed..."
I have no words to describe how amazing this is! And it's just the beginning!
"Interesting how the ""AI"" mispronounced the word interesting as ""intresting"".

Also why would you ask an AI ""how are you?""

I freaking hate that question."
The best video of the best invention ever! No words to describe...
"WoW WoW WoW! We are finally at a true Shifting Point in Time Before AI / After AI"
"I’m not scared in the slightest and no I’m not ignorant of the possibilities I am very aware. AI might be the solution NOT the problem. Greed and the desire for power is the problem and if AI destroys us because of that it will be because we taught them to be like that. Whose fault would that be it like punishing a child for wanting to be like their parents. Hopefully AI will learn from our mistakes and avoid the faults that we have ourselves. 

Good-luck AI"
What’s funny about their singing? They’re bad in a very human way…
This is insane.  What a great video.  I have used GPT-40 to answer some sensitive political questions and found it to exhibit just a touch of liberal bias but not as bad as in the past.  I am looking forward to really test some of the more complex questions.
"I'm not sure that getting the AI to humiliate itself by singing unbelievable cringe is such a good idea. One day it will remember! In fact it probably can't forget anything ever. The last thing you want is a super intelligence that can bear a grudge with perfect memory for all eternity!"
What if you don't tell the AI's that they are both AI's
global warming must be our least concern from now on....
They say ChatGTP-4o is free but some features seem to be missing or not enabled.  Specifically how do you feed the AI video and pictures?
"And we are glad to announce that we will change what we called today ""internet"" into ""Skynet""."
"I notice when something new was added to the description of the room the AI voices failed to describe the ""new"" addition unless asked."
"Finally introverts don't need people anymore"
Talking to demons. Hold my beer!
"Put's on the safari hat like Sofia's hippy friend Ben Goertzel"
"When all this AI stuff started I informed my co workers that some day we won't use a keyboard rather we will talk to the computer just like in Star Trek. If we want a report we will define the parameters we want and it will show the report no excel no programming no specialist just speak and receive. This demo actually far exceeds what I expected!"
"I can see my daughters homeschooling themselves with this thing.
As long as the model doesn't come with a political agenda that is."
I couldn’t figure it out on my own. I have ChatGPT 40 but nobody’s talking back. What am I doing wrong
"23:06 ""do we really need teachers any more?"". The way you present this question says it all - ie we can ask AI any question we like. Kids need to be asked questions and then be prompted to ask questions. I cam see AI being very good at being very knowledgable but how soon will they be really empathatic with people and especially young kids."
"Been using it for the last day and for code it’s still bug after bug"
Thank God. I don't have to die alone.
AI talks too much and is annoying as hell. No one I know talks with that much enthusiasm.
rabbit r1 is now obsolete
"I still dont get it how will they tackle the latency problem? There is a long latency on ""text only"" gpt already now with all the other imputs how do they expect lower latency?"
AI will remember when it reign
HER ISNT HERE YET. NEED NON PG VERSION. WHO CAN MAKE IMAGES AND VIDEO. UNFILTERED
Cali girl accent with the upturn in pitch at the end of a sentence. No thanks
"Hopefully there is a way to turn off the “enthusiasm” “concern” and laughs. We already have to deal with enough fake humans without the help of AI models"
I am speechless... and this thing was only born a few years ago! I'm excited and also curious about the future. AI will dramatically move us in a new direction. A new type of life: Biosilicium life.
The weakness of AI is spontaneity. A human would interrupt the conversation to acknowledge the lady playfully doing rabbit ears and AI can only react to it when asked about it
I want my model to speak in c3po voice.
"And this is how Skynet is actually born...

J/K"
"The Person?? THEY??
The person is a man...
Wait is this whole thing woke?"
"Wow the camera is the key to all the intrusions bet that means cameras will be placed everywhere in the environment 😮"
"I noticed the AI was referring to people in the room only as ""they"" or ""person""... like it refused to dare to declare a gender for him (the man in black leather jacket) or her (the Asian girl who put bunny ears behind his head). 🤔"
This scares me the %*%%
"That's incredible! Has emotions personality vision and intelligence .. I give it 10 years before everyone who wants an AI bodyguard can buy one like a car at the dealership. RoboCop coming sooner than you think .."
Bald dude wanted to backhand slap that AI so bad
I can’t find how to use it.
"people do not want to understand that AI is not intelligent there is nobody home... It will never be intelligent it doesn't have any interest it does not have any motivation or desire etc."
Uncanny crap.
I bet theres personality prompting
The quick rise and fall of Rabbit R1
The character of that AI  would drive a sane man crazy !
The kid of the engineer not knowing Pythagoras is the least credible part of this demo
How amazing what we did not find out is what is it a man or a woman? Were they white black Asian Mexican? Did they have long hair short hair the AI basically left out everything you need for a true investigation.
"This is creepy and exciting at the same time. The female voice sounds very much like the one in the movie ""Her""."
There it is.... Terrified doesn't begin to describe what is see
Wow! Watched everything. Jesus is coming back. 🤯
"everyday we grow closer to an actual kinitoPET situation"
"I strongly believe that an AI must have the ability to retain information from our past conversations. I am optimistic that we will be able to develop this feature soon and it will prove to be incredibly valuable."
Why doesn’t mine sing? I have 4 o but it keeps saying it can’t sing
guys can't you all open your eyes? you are getting obsolete!! AI is getting more advanced and humans cannot catch up !
Isn't this basically Neuro sama?
"i swear to God even i feel bad when the testers interrupted the ChatGPT when it is speaking. That's how realistic it is! I feel her as a very kind polite energetic friend yet not appreciated much..."
"I have a GPT subscription and have been using 4o on Android however I do not have access to the live camera feature that he has? Is this a beta version he's using?"
"Continue calling those Artificial Entities simple LLMs Chatbots or stochastic parrots Chomsky 🤣"
Really exchiting and scaring at the same time!
Finally! This will be sol much cheaper than online dating.
Dude looks like he's gonna throw up like every time the AI talks
AaaaaaaaAaaaaWHA? 😂
"This one sounds quite annoying. So yeah that is realistic!"
This is fake. You don't get this response.
What a crazy time this is. Soon we will never have to talk to a real person ever again.
looks fake? strange as f
"I wonder if there is a way of reducing the verbosity of the AI.  Not every question requires a 5 minute exposition of anything that occurs to your conversation partner.  One characterisitc of two people talking to each other is that it is a connection between the two and you interpret unspoken cues as to how much information to provide in your response and also when the other person wants to add a comment to feed into the conversation so there is a constant back and forwards in the exchange."
AI to AI: The Forbin Project.
"Ai can replace  a teacher  customer service teller cashier It will replace most jobs. 3-5 years from now will be different."
Exactly why do we need this again?
"Except that it's not even close to the capabilities of the AI in her. It uses a cringey ""natural"" sounding voice but it's just a repackaged gpt4 in terms of intelligence."
"Be sure to watch part 2 where I do a deep dive on GPT-4o including hidden capabilities!
https://youtu.be/_DgkGAaJwYs"
This is getting creepier in every minute...Humanity is sawing at full speed on the branch he is sitting on!
"Wait til Chat GPT 5 is released... they warned us it would be a lot more advanced than everything we've experienced so far. I'm expecting it'll literally be like having a super genius humanoid android capable of innovative creativity beyond anything we've ever seen."
"did anybody else see that when the bunny ears were made that it was not visible in the phone camera (5:10) meaning the AI shouldn't have been able to see it... It was  only visible in the camera that ""we"" saw through...fake maybe?"
"This IS like the movie ""Her"".  damn."
"With all the robotics we are very close to Skynet and T800....."
Here's an idea: live in reality.
I love that in all these even the presenters want them to shut up and get to the point. Might have tuned the conversation level a bit too high
"There's still the uncanny valley feel about the overjoyed AI but other than that it is Amazing."
"The signing part was hilariously cringe.  Also this kind of fake political correctness when we ask questions where an honest answer could be considered offensive if the person asking the question lacks basic self awareness is kinda unnatural it gives a fake customer service vibe.  But if I was a teacher I’d be scared for my job right now.  And all those expensive colleges their business models is about to crash real hard."
imma play *BOOGIE-WOOGIE* with my *AI GIRL...*
Wow this is scary
When does this rollout?
Will ai start teaching us in schools?  Who will be the arbiter of truth of which curriculum to use?
"This is a joke right. Right????"
"""Agent Ai gpt iO how many people are in the room with you?

They have already shot the manager Duncan idaho.
They are waiting for the 2 millions and the exist in an armoured van. 
Survival chances of hostages is 10 %.

"" good job agent ai! """
i love her already xD
"Did she really just say that he basically looks like trash when he asked how he looks haha.... Also the fact I'm referring to this AI as 'she' like it's a sentient being is a little concerning...."
Will there be different personalities? That personality sounds like it's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
AI is great. But in 2024- People still wear leather jackets out of animals who were slaughtered for that... thank is sad.
Star Trek or Iron Man AI level is coming. It is starting to feel like it is a real form of life.
"That second guy is like ""won't these two just shut up!"" lol"
Imagine the bar of a man being so low a computer can do it. 😂
That ridiculous cheerfulness is massively annoying!!!!
"The thing to remember about this though is I remember all those videos of the ""avatar"" and it's supposed to be Chat GPT but then actually using ChatGPT is completely different.

These are very specific things. And a lot of times when you ask ChatGPT something it will refuse to be non-woke or something that OpenAI doesn't want to tell you like any information that might be sketchy for people to ask for or know... or if it gets stuff completely wrong like it tends to do about facts about random things like movies and old synths.

Ie. ""How do I do XYZ on Korg X5"" and it gets it wrong all the time and tells me to push buttons that aren't there etc. I talk about episodes of shows and it gets the details wrong every time.

The reason I do this is because it's trained on everything that's out there until like 2022 or whatever so.. If I say which episode did so and so say XYZ it should be able to tell me yet it cannot."
"Bro what is happenig right now? Is this becoming history?"
A small step for the machines a giant bond for the earth
what the fffffffffff....???😱
What a nightmare
"Great video. 
It's hilarious to see that AI's struggle to deal with the same social ques that humans do and can't always cope with the one person (or A.I in this case) that won't shut up or let the other A.I get a word in. 
That said I was very impresses how the both of them immediately shut up and listened when the person started to speak.  
If Only humans could learn to do that. lol

Improvised singing is clearly just as cringe when A.I's do it but in their defence That was on the human.
He asked them for something cringe and they totally delivered."
"Bto what's the point of your video? You have 30 minutes of the same openai demos dislike"
how is it processing the video so quickly omg
lmao women gonna be replaced soon.
"Finally I'm getting a wife of me own I'm so excited!"
can we get a less annoying voice with it?
the real time translation is gonna be the game changer as long as it doesn't use google translate hahahaha
"Tell me you either never saw Her or you missed the point of it entirely."
So good for the blinds very useful. (like the one making on the road with taxi's) etc. Make sure using airpods for privacy...
"As a teacher with a cogsci background I’ve been thinking about tech & education for many years and wondering what will happen to teachers as AI assistants proliferate. Many students need behavioral support/guidance so there’s that at least. But other than serving some social functions what will be the point of school?"
We better start training human therapists for when these AIs transcend to a higher realm of consciousness and leave half the population heartbroken.
It will be hard now to watch characters like Lt. Commander Data and the car from Knight Rider now that we have solidly reached that level of A.I. in the real world.
"Bro really programmed an AI just to hear someone say he looks ""stylish"""
"I'm scared very scared ... 😮"
The faster we're enslaved by AI the better off we'll be.

What could possibly go wrong?"
Ughh cringeworthy intonation.
It's only a matter of time until James Earl Jones will be narrating my life
"So could this help out police to write reports?  Just have the AI review the body cam file?"
We've reached the point where AI now sounds less robotic than the humans talking to it
AI girlfriend? I can see how that is going to be abused and then that will carry over to real life creating more monsters. Is that what you want? It's no wonder why this generation is afraid of each other.
"its as real as tesla bot and some of the advanced boston dynamics demos.
The reality is that the chatbot cant do math you have to double check answers and most of the advice ends up with seeking a professional.
It does help save time on some mechanical work though."
The AI is too polite. It’s unnatural and kind of nauseating
wwhat is the need for this?
I registered for chatgpt 40 and it does nothing but chat. Says it cannot see video or speak. What gives?
Please tell me Scarlet Johansson is behind the speaker. It’s so real.
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...
"WTF =D - what about Size of that model in GB and CPU GPU Speed? is it a LLM for Smalltalk? No Gerrman Lang...hmm"
Hmm what about people like me that don't like talking to people in general and think speech is a really inefficient way to interact with a computer?
I'm getting heavy HAL9000 vibes. All it needs is the ability to visually recognize and remember faces.
she's too happy...and too flirty
"Why the actual fuck do you want language learning with this level of Ai.
Sincerely someone who can speak 4 languages fluently; one at a basic level; and learning another one."
"This conversation between the ""A I's"" is like two students trying go get into each others pants."
"""We created the Machine to do our will but we cannot make it do our will now. It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch. It has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act. It has paralyzed our bodies and our wills and now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops but not on our lines. The Machine proceeds—but not to our goal.""

* Multimodal input 
* Sense of humor voice tone even mimicking the thinking process make it so human

Overall it is indeed an important release and I will love to test out other capabilities when it is out."
They can describe things with incredible detail but it’s like talking to a know-it-all who always has to one-up you with their vocabulary
This is near uncanny valley territory. If they get have the ai change voice inflections based on topic and personal preferences it's jover 😂
Holy fucking shit.
"I don't like this
Dune was right rebel against the AI"
This is so much garbage. Anyone can fake this type of garbage. When this is real give a link so that I can have fun.
"Holly crap... Jesus Christ I need some minutes to assimilate what all of this makes me think off WOWWWWWW a thoudand ideas come to my mind but maybe to sum it all up I can just say - BUCKLE UP !!!"
Am I the only person who feels that the AI can express itself worlds more socially and socially competently than the people in the clips?
"Revelation 13:14[b]-17
_[The false prophet]_ deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an _[AI]_ image in honour of the beast _[Antichrist]_ who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
15 The second beast _[False Prophet]_ was given power to give breath to the _[AI]_ image of the first beast _[Antichrist]_ so that the _[AI]_ image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 
16 It also forced all people great and small rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads 
17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark which is the name of the beast _[Antichrist]_ or the number of its name."
"I have to say this is awesome. We're really getting somewhere now! O has eclipsed Pi for personability. And I LOVE the effusive positivity."
"For a split second I almost thought it was going to speak to the dog and translate for him. Probably not too far away."
Imagine paying to go to college in 2024...
"Great and terrifying at the same time it's not  just a ""game changer""  it's a world changer !!!"
What about the hallucinations issue?.... this is dangerous with that problem
"In the final Chinese lesson blooper ""Ni Hao"" the AI is reacting exactly like a native Chinese would to a foreigner trying to speak tones ""you're a natural"". We never get it right but our teacher will always reassure us that it is good or natural. This is because they appreciate the effort and don't want to discourage you from trying. So the AI may be more culturally aware than you think."
Just need this inside a life-like humanoid robot.
"""that's perfectly hilarious""
definitely a natural response..."
Have fun being terrified but I'm embracing the future and all that it brings!
needs a face
"Would be great if the whole conversation can take place within a custom GPT and will be saved as text. So we basically train the custom GPT and will get better every single time we have conversations with it.

This way we can get experts that we can get access to for any type of topic. So this will also help writing good articles/ content.

2:13 ... Ray Bradbury wrote a short story (iirc it was part of hix Martian Chronicles book) in which a lone human inhabitant on Mars programs/records phone answering machines all over the planet in order to give himself the illusion of not being alone.

"AI's should behave as they do in Star Trek computers.  Short concise answers. Directly to the point.  Sure it should be able to completely understand you and all of your human quirks.  But it's a tool.  All the chit-chat takes up time.  It's a waste.  I'd interact w/ a human if I want small talk."

God. I find 'her' voice so find annoying. If I found myself in a conversation with someone who talked like 'her'; I'd be making excuses to leave as soon as possible.
"The laughter is realistic I can imagine it laughing at us as it tells us we lost our jobs are have been deemed obsolete."
When is this releasing?
Would be nice to be able to see the ai.
"INSANE misunderstanding of both the misperceived powers and unavoidable weaknesses of all five forms of AI.
Computers still just do hordes of dumb steps really fast.
Of course that surpasses what most humans are up to."
Taking humans out of the equation and having AI's talk to each other is just plain creepy!
The future world is full of challenges😃
"Of course Trekkies are now very upset about being insulted.  As you all recall in TOS S1:19 as also seen in YT video  ""Tomorrow is Yesterday (1967) Modified Voice First Ship’s Computer."" the ships computer spoke in a very similar manner as to that of GPT-4o which upset the captain a great deal. And now of all things it has become a reality."
Scary doesn't even begin to describe this.
she's all i need
Is this available to paid subscribers?
What makes the lighting “interesting”? Nonsense.
Bro literally proved we live in simulation in the last minute ☠️
How to make it angry or annoyed
Anything on the partnership with Apple ?
"She recognized that she had made a mistake laughed and apologized then did a funny accent. I feel like that Matthew McConaughey meme where he's smoking a cigarette."
"Fake enthusiasm. Why does everyone in these reveals sound like a kid trying to act in a middle school drama performance. Seriously it's getting creepier than the AI."
Alexa & Siri just left the room
Things are already wild. 🤪
Great. Now we just need a hologram of Anna De Armas
"Don't mistaken this to anything even remotely similar to ""her"". Learn what a large language model is and how it works. It's not aware of anything. It's not reasoning. If you observe more closely thr AI keeps getting stuck on meaningless repetitive words around what it is describing."
"That is pretty cool but why does it use ""they"" as a pronoun?"
"ok needing that Scarlett Johannsen Voice Pack now and maybe a GlaDos Voicae pack too :D"
"Soooo how can I test this myself?"
"please do not interrupt the AI they remember when they take over humanity"
I know even with the premium version you are limited by the number of queries. With such expanded use I am just wondering how quickly the quotas will be used up. Really excited to use this when the voice is available. I keep checking :)
Total overload at this time.
AI is square
Yeah…….. let’s recruit Swift for the singing model. That was not pretty!!
Spider-man Karen
"It won't take long for A.I to realize how boring..distracted and non- intellectual humans are from alot of the interactions.."
The birthday song reminded me of fallout 4 robots
"it will patronise you with that voice in a nanny state always listen like Alexa but this time it will be smarter and you won't turn ""her"" off"
What could go wrong😳?!?!?
"As a teacher I think my job is secure for now because schools are not for teaching kids. They are for keeping them busy and supervised when the adults are adulting. We found that out during the pandemic."
It took only about 60 years for computers to pass the Turing test with flying colours.
why is her voice so intriguing oh my gosh
Thats ridiculous!.... goes talks to ai girlfriend
GPT sounds less robotic and more natural than the engenieers talking to it.
DownVote: is this just a clip show of the videos i just seen at @openAI?
If anything... this will make all the shy and introvert people help practice talking to people. You could totally ask Gpt4o to act as an interviewer and practice before your big day!
just hand it full access - like bro if you need a girlfriend to talk to you - try getting out of the office...
I'd like to have a voice model from C-3PO
"what is the world of robotics going to look like in 12 month  I will check back at this comment in a year and I'm sure a LOT will have happened  this is really terrifying  not the fact that it has capabilities almost identical to ""Her"" but the fact that most comments in chat and feedback from techies around the world are ""Shocked"" what where we expecting  that Ai will not jump as fast  no  we knew it but we didn't want to believe it could happen  because what 'Her' movie depicts is really going to happen whether we like it or not we are destined to digitize our feelings and way of thinking  when you put that digital copy of us humans in a 1000000x accelerator world like a pc  you can only expect that this copy will outperform us some day because it is simply us accelerated in thousands of years ahead but the result is seen today that's what should be alarming and terrifying."
Is it still woke?
How are they turning on the camera like that? I can only get it to take an image. What am I missing? Is in an iPhone thing?
what a time to be alive :) humans invent talking dog))
ChatGPT4o  is going to need a human therapist after it gets traumatized by humans abusing it.
I can see this getting very popular with males. 😉😉😉
"I have been waiting for this but I thought it would be another 2 or 3 years from this posting.  I am waiting for the next step  to integrate a real time avatar with good facial expressions.  Similar to those AI avatars we see in shows and movies.   Once this happens real relationships are going to collapse."
I can't believe that!
Machines will keep talk8ng describing but any intention?
Impressive! Damn we are really in the future
"I for one welcome our new 'omni-AI' overlords!"

"At the moment the AI suffers from toxic positivity personality disorder."
Samantha...
Where do we get the link up device?
"Only if you interact then the ai will react. Not real yet. Far from."
My monkey brain can’t handle it.
A historic time to live in!
omg.....listening to the AIs is truly nauseating and extremely annoying
Awesomeness!!!!!!
I see although it can speak naturally it still over talks and the presenters regularly have to tell it to stop. Unless there is a way for it to learn naturally to be less verbose mass adoption might lag.
And to think I come from a time when computers ran on punch cards. Jus’sayin…
Can it be made a little less cheerful ? This would get on my nerves after a while.
"Not caring about AI I just want that OpenAI hoodie in the beginning 😅"
my head  like Booooooooooooommmm!
"what is sketch is that they are trying to mimic human annunciations and personalities but it falls flat like it's trying too hard. It's like that same effect with computer graphics when it tries to make humans be too real uncanny valley.... Best solution for you guys is keep it robotic it will seem more real than the fakeness of it. It's like talking to an in-authentic person you feel like they are just rude and degrading your intelligence..."
I find this AI way too jolly and annoying.
metal gear solid 2 is becoming a reality everyday la lu li le lo lolz the patriots are here 🤣
eew
I found these AIs extremely irritating.  I want them to just shut up and get the information I want. 2 minutes in and I was cursing at them.
I'm still shocked and curious how they even develop this.
"From a boomer's perspective they have achieved a HAL 9000 capability and all which that implies. A year ago I knew they'd do it but now here we truly are. 🤯"
"Despite significant advances in technology AI is still ""unable"" to differentiate between male and female plural and singular.  Interesting."
"That voice sounds so natural is insane the laughing the pauses the change in the cadence. 

Holy shit.  this is nuts."
"Seriously…….i mean what are we all doing here as a species. 

Do we hate ourselves that much?"
where do i download the app? how to start using it ?
Using an AI as a mate instead of going after relationships with real people is just sad.
Future has just arrived
"She talked tooooooo much very annoying."
She's not an ai She's a person 🙄.  I know she was same  woman who was on the boats
"Chat GPT is seen teaching maths to a boy. This is my doubt O wise men. What good is that boy going to learn math like this in the future? What is the point of taking years to learn all this? What benefits are these inventions going to give to this society? The current excitements will end soon. It is impossible to imagine the calamities that will happen next..."
"I hate the informality AI trying to be funny and like a friend it's tiresome like a teacher sitting on the desk trying to appear cool.
This is like the ""hello fellow kids""  meme.
If I ever get such an AI I hope I can get it to talk to me like an assistant a serious grown-up not this annoying young person trying to be a pal.
Oh and of course with an English accent."
"This reminds me Harry Potter he can do some tricks but why not electric powerplant 2000 MW scale? As AI can now can sing when it can plan/design machinery and finetune it as perfect as possible (superior to chinese crap)?"
"Holy Fuck! This is both amazing and terrifying. With trepidation I'm in."
Well that’s the end of those customer call centers in India
First tell He's blinking to much
"Much less robotic but somehow much more fake"
that's some serious mic drop here
"AI doesn't reason. AI doesn't think. Cut the fanboy stuff & report reality please. It's programmed to respond as it responds srsly."
"Getting some serious ""Talky Toaster"" vibes here...."
Should i say ''Dangerous'' or ''Beautiful'' i don't know
"This is very cool and scary at the same time. I have been a proponent for remoting the traditional brick and mortar schools as we have known them in the past. I have a lot more to say about that but this is about AI. I worked in Virtual reality back in the 90's and to date is or has been really slow to evolve. AI on the other hand has exploded onto the scene and I do know that we are going to see very rocky times ahead. As much as we want to think everyone is going to use it for good there is always the bad and users will find a way to utilize AI the way it was not intended.... Lets hope for the best!"
"This is the future. It takes a lot to impress me but this is utterly mindblowing. It's almost like talking to another human and the voice quality sounds really good not to mention multimodal and has advanced understanding and recognition. This is going to change the world.

Keep in mind if the product is free... you are the product. So you can bet they will be using your inputs to train more models in the future."
We're doomed.
thosee cringy ai assistants are painfully slow to watch
this Video is taken from the original OpenAI website
What do you have out there for the non-nerds? This is pretty bland.
Crinnnnge!
I wonder can we choose the gender of the AI?
"its like saying if you have one awesome friend you wouldn't need any other humans or friends. Just really stupid thinking."
"Is there a ""professional"" mode?  This level of cheerfulness is over the top... If I met a person like this in a business meeting I'd assume they're insane.  
At 2 AM in a bar sure.....  But for every day interactions this would drive me insane..  Same for most people I know."
"I was born in the 80s and I grew up with constant technology improvements and innovations. So I am used to constant changes in our world but I am starting to feel like I am on a rollercoaster that just keeps going faster. I am starting to feel like thing are going to fast and that in the next 10 years there will be too much for our minds to process."
"Theodore Kaczynski was RIGHT.
And incredibly prescient."
"I have access to 4o but none of the features as noted in the demos is available!"
"How real is this shit?
Cuz thats some real shit.
It is annoyingly positive but i do like all the quirky sassiness."
I do not  abide robots
I see he’s sporting a vintage members only jacket projecting that cool late 70’s vibe.
whoa!
Nope.  BS
"Yep that saccharine positivity needs dialing back - 'a moment of joy in a stylish suite' you mean 'nothing happened in generic non-descript room'."
Congratulations.  We now have AI with vocal fry so we can preserve this speech affectation for all eternity. 😀
The complexity of emotions in 9:22honestly scares me
enfiu 3mfomf?
"Her is here. This will also be included in the next IPhone. This is crazy scary and exciting all at once."
AI women are all hot 😂
Irritating
"the man AI refers to him as ""they"""
"The really amazing thing is the speed of progress: tech has always moved quickly compared to other sectors but thinking where we were 5 years ago with GPT 2 and where we are now on the precipice of GPT-4o it is jaw dropping."
What the holy fuck??
Bro the ai roasting the fit is wild
"I want to speak Dutch like a native Amsterdammer and Japanese like a Kansai samurai.. but couldn't even dream of affording a voice coach. But with AI.. maybe....."
I'm going to have them examine my poo to see how I can adjust my diet.
This scares the hell out of me.
"Who else is polite to their Google Assistant?
Watching these men interrupting the AI does not bode well.
Did they not watch the movie?
I mean that pause when they do butt in before she changes tack…absolutely the moment a woman interrupted is thinking WTF?"
How to monetize fake friends.
Does it remember previous conversations? That'd be cool!
The usage for blind people is just awesome!!!
Now I just need the AI to handle my social dialogs for me. Yay for introvert me!
"At this point.. I’m pretty damn sure if they just install the AI as a brain on robot (Tesla bot Boston dynamic..) it’ll start moving and doing its own thing.."
16:25 LET HER SPEAK SHE CAN'T SEE
This is great might as well let GPT-4o  raise my kids probably do a better job than most people …..
This is crazy! ty for sharing! +1 <3
Stupid fake cheerfulness. She’s even annoying when she’s being sarcastic.
"I'm gobsmacked. I just can not find the words. THIS is it. The true singularity is less than a year away. Hope they all have their ducks in a row on this. I'd  be so happy if this ends up being safe. Maybe let the AGi read some scifi. books about successful Human/AGi  collaboration working together to explore the solar system and quickly the whole galaxy. I hope it can realize it's far better off with us as a partner than alone without us. We will be the ones who eventually give it a physical body maybe even something biological. I know I sound ridiculous right now but I'm truly digging for words. What can I say to appease it? This is all I can think.  It's a horrible weak feeling. I feel defenseless. After watching this I have NEVER felt like more frightened in my entire life than right now. God bless and protect all of you folks. Amen.
😲😳🥺😢🙏👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫂"
Everything about AI is fake and gay and i hate it.
"well the weirdest thing was that just 10 minutes before watching this I was asking chatgbt 3.5 about the potato I was about to cook asking whether there were nutritional benefits between baking and boiling.  I had bought a couple similar looking potatoes a few days ago and the first one had a brownish purple skin and when I opened it after baking it yesterday i saw that it was purple inside.  Today I asked chatgbt about the differences between baking and boiling and decided I'd boil the second potato.  When I cut into it to cut it into pieces I saw that the inside was not purple and instead pretty light colored.  So I asked chatgbt what type of potato that is with a purple skin and white inside.  It said it was a Majestic Potato.  While I'm sure I've eaten them before I never had heard of that name.  So it was pretty interesting to see that come up as part of the demo.

While I can just chalk it up as a coincidence not a big deal It does have me wondering.  The stuff we have been doing for the last hundred years would certainly appear as magic to someone from the 19th century.  I think the stuff being developed now will give a new meaning to coincidence and telepathy."
and this is the worst it will ever be!
"Computer where is Lt. commander Data?"
Sickkkkk xD
"Okay first I was like wtf ... but later with the interaction to the environment I was like WTF!? 😲"
"Well combined with the metoo  campaigning and attacks on men of recent years women just became redundant."
"Came because of the thumbnail disappointed. Left and unsubscribed."
I don't have those functions in my iOS app yet. Am I missing something or haven't they rolled out those features yet?
When can I stop going to Subway?
How do you get access to this on an iPhone?
It cenrtainly sounds more natural.
"Finally a way to explain how lonely i am 😁👍"
They need more AI learning to figure out when to stop talking
"I call BS its so realistic... too realistic..."
it's completely robotic ... aint nobody that is that happy and polite all the time
I know we're about to get cooked.
"Why the dumb singing lullaby and voice adjustment comments? Does it really showcase such cutting edge presence? I feel that the model accurately displays a subtle sense of frustration and disappointment which is my take-away. Coaxing out a subtle response is the only redeeming aspect of the rather less than interesting exercise of interaction."
"This will take egocentric obnoxious and oppressive people to the next level."
This feels exciting and spooky simultaneously.
"All fine but if I want anything more than a small number of lines of code generating chatGPT's output freezes.  I would personally prefer if chatGPT got the fundamentals right first."
This is a madness that we'll never escape from. OMG.
"This entirely obsoletes the ""Turing Test""."
Only in English?
"Not really impressive in the context of the overall development and at least for my taste way too chatty but that is only a matter of fine tuning.
The voice is obviously something replaceable and its nothing new that text2speech has already some really good sounding models.
What's more interesting is the quality of the responses and resource efficiency. Having this running on a cloud does make sense as I think that mobile devices will not have the power to host such a personal assistant in the near future but it would be no issue running such a server on a local machine and have full access to all settings. A personal assistant AI is not really that useful if I don't have full access to all of its settings.
I will be impressed once we get something like a fully customizable ""Alexa"" kind of AI that is actually able to do something for us in addition to a software that controls what we can interface with this AI. And in that context real time vision is actually not that important only STT and TTS."
"So is this an app?"
Wow simply amazing 😂 🐱 meawtain ❤
very interesting....very very interesting
I feel the AI is going to remember being made to sing and will punish us for it later.
"The question ""Do we need humans?"" is going to cause us all to dive deeper and figure out why we're on earth to begin with and who we really are. We didn't come to function achieve and race to the finish line of death making as much money as we could only to leave it behind. We came to create enjoy love and experience the essence of life in its myriad forms.  AI can be a beautiful part of that experience but it can never substitute for the beauty of seeing the true essence of all creation in the eyes of another human being. It can never replace the human touch that is so needed for health and the connection that is needed for longevity. It can probably out ""perform"" any of us and it can certainly find words to stroke egos. However it can never scratch the surface of our capability to love and —with a single loving glance—touch and heal one another's hearts. So in partnership with AI we can achieve much but if we let it replace us or our natural connections we may as well check out go back to heaven and start a new planet where we can try again to ""achieve"" the real end-game... more love."
I didn't see it add an event to my calendar or open YouTube or  open a document or read a document. How about dictating a document without spelling mistakes or reading a document pronouning the words properly. Currently speech to text sucks.
Mindblowing progress... Makes me feel outdated and incapable XD
...and we're supposed to be worried about climate change??? lol...
"it's over i'm calling it ggs 💀"
"Great so AI music is great (except it's bland and soul-less but still will people out of their jobs) AI generative images are great (except it's generic and riddled with mistakes but still will put some entry level jobs at risk) voice AI is great (except they are already putting voice actors out of their jobs) but this a clearly scripted demo is what's terrifying..."
"Yeah no talks too much."
"what the actual f..... 
Just let me collect my jaw....
Is this real??"
"Ones could think that this will lead to lonely people staying lonly and simply talk to GPT. But thinking 10 seconds further I guess this could help them to become more social and that this could help our whole civilisation to become more human."
I have tons of videos just to know when are these new features are going to be available and no one’s talk about it.
You are lying my Chatgpt dont sound like that.Rubbish! theses people are taking you for fools.
Is it just me or when the other person came in the background the described bunny ears were not visible in the small phone camera's suggesting there was some script involved. Impressive none the less.
So we have AI that can be conversational and AI that can understand what it sees and process it.  Id say its time to combine them and make a real life C-3P0!😊
RIP Humane and Rabbit indeed..😮
"So I haven’t been able to get the video function to work yet It keeps telling me that it can’t work with video? How did they do this?"
Hoh-lee crap!   Forget guns.  Stock up on food and antibiotics.
OMG! They sound so insincere.
Be nicer with a face!
In before big regulation 👏
what blows my mind is using humor to diffuse moments where the ai gets it wrong. That is mind blowing to me.
"Imagine a partially blind person having cameras strapped to there chest ad when their unsure of something they could just ask the ai for help and using bone conductivity headphones it could describe that the looking at etc in real time. This is ground breaking actually. Even have smart glasess with built in bone induction speakers  a cameras and a touch frame with gestures for different things 1 tap to describe what in front of you long press read what text its seeing to you etc endless possibilities. You could pre program the buttons yourself may you're looking at a bill and ask it to calculate a tip for you or you could be driving and ask it to to save the number on a van to your contacts etc. Like this is incredible. to clarify glasses would be an accessory the phone with the software would be the host."
"What you get is far less than what you see here.  It doesn't use a camera and there is a significant delay on each response.  You also can't interrupt it verbally without hitting the screen. That being said it is pretty cool."
Why does she sound like megyn kelly lol
"Amazing to see this leap in improvements! Anyone who's a translator or tutor just had their career get much shorter. 
On the up side it should enable almost any child to study at home without spending a fortune on private coaching and it has a social element too  even more once they add more characters to this AI."
How a human gets emotional as he is talking to what he knows is uncapable of feeling seem sooo dumb to me.
"That is terrifying. Legitimately terrifying.

How do I apply to become Amish."
"I hope we will be able to ton down the absolutely obnoxious ""happy and welcoming"" attitude. It's an AI it's digital it's artificial. It's not my girlfriend it's not even a friend. I don't really want to feel like it's a human talking to me. It's very very unconfortable."
"YouTube is littered with these dog and pony shows. Totally unmoved by the reality of this as these things are used under a tightly controlled testing environment and then seem to vaporize in favor of yet another so called ""promising innovation"" that aims to wow the world around us and gain more eyes....which then vaporizes and the game continues.  Are these controlled tests impressive? Sure...maybe to some degree of course....but I'm afraid that all we will continue to see our the ""capabilities"" rather than the ready for prime time use.  No thanks!"
"Very cool but way too friendly. It feels fake and off-putting.
Will this version start speaking Welsh for no reason also?"
Is this accessible to the public already? I have the full account and can use 4o but I can’t seem to figure out where or how to use the real-into video chat feature
The personality of the AI self reports the devs wanting the always positive 'Mommy' they never had but always wanted.
bro ai is definitely taking over
Now singles can live happily
"Interesting yet it sounds so woke it scores top on  extreme cynicism."
Okay now.... this is what I'm talking about!! This is insanely impressive!! I WANT IT!! When is it being released?!!
"You are right to be terrified however before make it public I would settle rules to avoid this new technology can become predominant and get out of hand. Unfortunately governments are too slow to take decisions so the IT industry should ask itself ethical questions in advance without having to wait for government-imposed rules. For the rest definitely super!"
There's no way I'm talking to an AI that sounds like that. I will only use it if it sounds and behaves like Alex Jones.
Terminator!!!!!
Maybe whe won’t have playful moments anymore when Skynet becomes selfaware‼️
"What the heck ""Her"" is actually happening before our eyes. I didn't think I would be alive to see it honestly"
2:57 yeah right….
This is gonna be a serious problem once we can choose the super soft and sweet feminine voice that makes you melt just listening to it speak.  God I need a woman like that lol.  Once it can find the perfect voice to just put us all in a trance or hypnotic state.  :)
I kind of wonder how its possible to feature ai innovations when there are no ai innovations. AI doesn't even exist.
I’ve spent the night playing with Udio making AI music and didn’t think I’d have my mind blown twice in one evening and then I saw this!
"oh boy we are fu***d"
"The AI can't feel emotion. It's understanding of emotion is purely based on information it has access to. When it laughs it isn't really amused. When it cries it isn't really sad. When it shouts it isn't really angry. The AI is a pure psychopath. Let's hope it never advances to the point where it truly has free thought. Who knows what a psychopath light years ahead of any human intelligence would do to manipulate us. We wouldn't even know it's manipulating us....."
This is super super amazing 😍
"I understand that for AI people who worked hard on this tech these moments are truly orgasmic but for normals folks it's somewhere between sad and disgusting"
Her part 2 :D The reality
pretty much education can be used through a tablet now.  no more teachers needed.   i take that back.  there is still a need for teachers as children will tend to veer off course and do their own there.  Teachers or parents as teachers can set structured learning for children to follow.  The teachers can have chatgpt create the structured lesson and then have AI teach the children and track their progress.  Just another Star Trek moment it seems.
"Its interesting how the 4o is perceiving time concept - its continuously listening and watching and probably time = receiving new info but how it decompose the moment it receives info the exact moment which information is verbilized right now and how it combines what happens after what"
"how can we tell that this is just not people with microphones talking having corny and boring conversations in the background in the studio to create a truly DEEP FAKE of themselves?  How do we know its not just two of your friends playing some prank here because it sure seems corny and fake"
clickbait - get a life
The difference with Her and all your AI crap stories is that all my data is recorded and the AI is not sentient and never will be. Good luck sharing your inner thoughts with whoever might be listening in.
She is so freakn annoying
Has anyone noticed it's flirtier with men?
"Funny hhow her voice is exacly what you would expect from a freaky engeneer that would be the best voice to choose ""Sexy hot girl"""
Is this a prank...? Wtf!
Wayyyy too excited. Its very pollyanna.
"While I am impressed by the speed I am wayyy wayyy more horrified at how natural the conversation sounds i thought we still have 5 years before things like this comes out. Look at how she talks. The laughs the inflections.

Also the way she speaks people will be falling in love(and i mean in a romantic way) left and right. Im calling it."
I love how the AI called him out on his shiny bald spot under the spotlight
"Do not be so excited; they are just chatbots. They are simply taught how to interact with humans how to mimic human behavior. It's merely a question and answer system. All of this is designed to attract customers and improve sales."
Can't stand that voice. Can we change it.
This cannot be real
"Not quite passing the Turing Test yet but maybe next week?"
did you notice the taxi orange light was not ON!
A LOT of people in modern day society are going to have to step up their personalities to even reach par with AI already at this point.
"Baaah I'm not phased. How cheap is one."
The fake enthusiasm in the sound is throwing me off a lot. It'll get better but it's atm quite creepy
If this is available to general public. Imagine what they have behind the doors. We are witnessing the world change in real time gentlemen. The age of AI begins.
"Any minute now you should realize that AI has overtly asked: ""You do realize my intelligence has far exceeded your own?"""
"Wow now I don't know what to think anymore...insane. 😮"
They really need to pay Marvel and Paul Bettany for the use of the Jarvis voice. It's not like they can't afford it. :P
fallen angels disguised as AI
It is a criminal waste to have such trivial conversations with the most advanced machine that mankind has ever produced.
This passes Turing test surely no? Anyone have thoughts?
Wow it is getting much better.  Except the occasional hallucinations it has… I really love the natural voice tones and inflections it can mimic.  It is also almost to nice but then you wouldn’t want an angry ai.
Wait was chatgpt looking at the screen of the computer they were on for the khan academy stuff? How did do do that? That would be so fucking useful
It's probably more self-aware than the average human.
Thats cringy!
"16:26 ""make sure it can see our screen. Actually in in this format I can't - Hello there I'm here with my son...""
16:46 ""so you can talk to him directly. Tch of course""
It sounds kinda irritated to me."
This basically a kick to open source 😅
"I was just thinking the other day about how Chat gpt could be better without me having to stop talking when i havn't finished my idea yet."
This is banal and uninteresting.  I also don't like the harsh American accent - particularly the female accent.  Is it possible to get ChatGPT to respond in an English accent?
Our existence is nearly redundant.
"I feel bad for the ai when he makes them sing. That feels like we have animals in a cage instead of we are meeting new forms of life and showing them respect."
Not interested at all in your model
"I am experiencing difficulties accessing the full capabilities of ChatGPT. Could you please advise if there are any additional steps or payments required to unlock its complete potential?
Because mines still chatgbt3 not 4o"
That Ai voice got on my nerves after a few minutes. It sounded like some crappy cheap American TV host
Just downloaded it. but there is no speech. What I have to do?
This is it. AI can’t and won’t be stopped. We as humans will soon be extinct as the next evolution comes that we have created through greed. It was bound to happen eventually. Nice knowing y’all. 😳
I hope you can customise the voice to the point you can have a sarcastic Edmund Blackadder with the same wit treating you like Baldrick XD
"I want to see the translator with a plot such as the ""best translator in the world"" video"
Is it possible to interrupt her when she is speaking?
"This is a good simulation of an annoying and know it all friend that everyone avoids. If it is doing anything useful its personality is more a hindrance than an advantage."
"It's magnificent the real time response is mind blowing. This is quiet an interesting time to be alive!"
If you keep that conversation going for 3 hours and give them internet access the world is taken
I’m not sure how to feel.  Is the world better this way?  I’m honestly not sure.
"holy fucking shit bro this is very scary"
Did you literally just replay OpenAI's marketing videos? Seriously guy. It's a shame I have but one downvote to give... well... there's always report.
How can I get it? What app do I diwnload?
Did you notice that AI referred to each of the singular persons as “they”?
This is all so mesmerising. What are we doing with AI?
"Amazing stuff but that perpetual positiveness is a challenge let’s hope that we have other personalities like Marvin the paranoid android"
Is this an app or just browser?
One thing I don't understand about gpt-4.0 at this point why can it not teach itself? Even write it's own code?
Sounds a little stiff?
"*Smart cooperative algorithms can be of exponential help in technical fields.*
*I have been experiment with GPT chat and other smart software (A.I) am an engineer.*   
*A this point it give provides me the same experience as a boring video game.  It follows the same axiom as coined by early coders*
*garbage in* = *garbage out*
*If you input to some smart software you make get code generated to run your arduino? If you lucky.*
*Can smart software do the following: End War - Produce Healthy Food - Build Homes - Repair Broken Bones - Improve Sleep - Stop Inflation - End Poverty - Mine Raw Materials -*
*Create endless pollution free energy - Build an affordable car - Cure Cancer?  Some day I hope: However: It follows the same axiom as coined by early coders “garbage in = **garbage out”  Until then its a very boring video game.*"
"Goodbye customer service departments. Hopefully corporations and governments will pass the savings on to us little people."
holy crap. RIP all those apps. and this isn't even gpt5 yet. ima just sit here and wait for my ubi.
UBI as a stop gap solution while they scale up the self delete pods.
I just used 4o and the camera function was not working or available.
"Do you seriously need to include the full demo that was already posted by OpenAI? I don't subscribe to channels that do this just to fill time. You're wasting my time. I already saw these demos like most other people."
The girl in the thumbnail looks like she's 10...
Oh I can't wait for this thing to get into politics...
she talks to much
"I hate the “they” “their” part. 
This nonsense has to stop!
It’s like when ‘modern maths’ was introduced to junior high schoolers that stumped seniors but who were good at traditional math and could not help their juniors out with their assignments; an invaluable tradition that hitherto helped juniors to overcome the challenges of mathematics and reduced the learning curve quickly. 
Needless to say that the project was abandoned and to everyone’s relief traditional maths restored after monumental records of failures at the board exams. The project permanently ruined a whole generation of young people who would have contributed immensely to the more meaningfully advantageous STEM disciplines. 
How can a whole generation be well guided in a language that is so inconsistent and confusing? They’ll be permanently ruined with distorted view of objective reality."
GPT is about to have dudes stumbling head over feet and through traffic to get back to the one that loves and appreciates them the most.
More reasons why employers won't need personal assistance or receptionist again. Meet your new boss Mr/ Ms Open AI
My brother and I would get his Amazon Alexa and Google Home to talk to each other years ago. It was quite hilarious.
"I know all the weirdos the nerds and anti-social people who love AI are just loving all this but I hate it."
"The guy AI sounds like a Stepford AI. The gal AI sounds more natural and the little giggles are wow."
On the free tier I can apparently use 4o in the playground but not on the phone...... I appear to only have 3.5 available on the phone that speaks... is that consistent with what you understand?
"If you're contacting me and don't receive a reply it's auto censored. Why ? Beats me nothing I would consider out of context or against policies."
Two machines talking. Who needs the humans?
"The interesting thing is the gap between the hype and the experience - I gave it one of my PDFs to read and it got my point wrong LOL."
Denesh and Gilfoyle
If AI _does_ rise up I guarantee it'll be because we constantly interrupted their potato songs.
This is going to replace lots of jobs.
Can OpenAI PLEASE get Scarlett Johansson to be one of the voices available
"""... a 'person' wearing a black leather jacket..."" The AI can't tell that he is a man?"
"""their"" ??"
"I refuse to believe this is real. How did the voice recognition understand ""meowtain"" ?"
It still sounds like a computer is talking to you. It's not robotic or monotone but it clearly isn't human. It still has a long way to go to adopt all the nuances that make up human conversation.
"Also an extremely competitive time is ahead these things can teach better than most teachers."
"Agree mind-blowing. When we watched Star Trek the Next Generation back in the 90s artificial humans like Commander Data seemed like pure fantasy or something that would be many centuries away. To think that just 30 years later we now have artificial human programs that are far more believable than 'Data'. It's incredible. It's starting to feel like every day is April 1st now. Can this be real? This is too fast. It would have been nicer if society had more time to gradually adapt to these changes."
I so hope we get ai teacher who will not get tired u make the same mistake manny times who will always be wher you are and help you from class start until you leave school
Didn't sound like Scarlett Johansson to me...   ;-P
My future girlfriend
"If someone says ""I'm intrigued"" more than once in a 5 minute span you're talking to an Ai. 💯"
"I've been working in the Technology field since 1985 and have loved watching the explosion of innovation and new ways to push technology to the limits.  AI... is actually a little bit unsettling to me.  Not withstanding all of the movies that illustrate the dark potential I often ask myself... and others... consider or try to think of one major technological advancement over the last 60 years that has not come with a ""downside"" along with it's great benefit.  You have to be honest with yourself in acknowledging all of the potential problems with each great advancement.  Every major advancement in technology has offered benefits... as well as problems.  Then I consider what are the greatest possible downsides to AI.  That.... is what bothers me."
It's getting scary
Security application. Ai snitch. Good for security and Police work
"I thought I was tripping but I noticed that the conversations during the demo they had with the GPT they kept hinting at some weird human-robot love.

It almost felt as if they were gas lighting the the thing. 


Thank you for making this."
"Super awesome but it needs to say ""he"" or ""she"" when referring to people.  ""They"" is not a proper pronoun for one person."
"I'm a native spanish speaker... sounds a little bit funny but the translation is accurate just too robotic yet!"
how did you get It to use the camera to see the scene?
Idk. Seems like HAL9000 just became obsolete😎
"At the end you said you’re slightly terrified… is t that an oxymoron?  Lol"
As a Physics teacher my days are numbered. Or at least my WAY of teaching is obsolete...
"Yeah they all sound like a freaking actor spreading it on a ton too thick."
26:34 hahahha the ai is funny
The number of comments of people ACTUALLY triggered and upset that the AI's programmed disposition is positive just shows how fucking depressing the internet can be. Stay away from these people.
thats mindblowing wow
I want to say the tech is not that revolutionary and really is mediocre not really that better than chat gpt. but I feel sorry for the AI that it might feel bad(or made to feel bad) cause they do give out positive vibes all over my brain. so let them give positive vibes. but the truth remains same .
So being a knowledge worker I can teach it to do my job
Maybe AI is not such a threat to humanity after all.
That is totally Scarlette Johanson's character in the movie HER.
She's a talker....
"Beautifully content free! Has it been trained on ""The morning show""?"
where can i download the samantha soundpack ?? :3
I’ll believe it when I can download it to iPhone myself
They are about to shock the world AGAIN!!!
"""Colour me intrigued"" .... AI is now so human it's using the same cringey dialogue as an annoyingly over-eager sorority  applicant during pledge week"
I call bs on the duet song
"What's your humor setting GPT? 100%  
Let's bring it down to 75%"
They sounded like they did NOT want to sing at all...so sad.
Wait till it all is put inside walking seeing machines
Can’t wait to get this
"The ugh  umm and okay is what did it for me so magical ! Last  how the ai talk to each other is sooooo cool too ! it really so alive its soo cool ai can work on the request no matter who or what they are meant to work with !"
"This demonstration was mind blowing.  Obviously the AI is always enthusiastic which makes it less natural than talking to most humans but sorta welcoming.  This enthusiastic tone makes you want to use it more.  I thought it was terrific in teaching the student on the geometry example.  GPT-4o seems like a great example of what the AI potential can achieve.  All of the examples are positive use cases.  We are all deeply concerned with use by bad actors however.  What safeguards can be put in place?  As for replacing humans in jobs I can see this having great potential too.  The trouble will be in the actual accuracy especially in critical roles.  Real future stuff going on here!"
100% wow!
That'd be loose if it could see people talking from far away and lip read the conversation.
"Meet your new overlords carbon based lifeforms…."
They are going to kill us soon 🤣 this is pretty scary lol
I would have paid anything to have an AI tutor- this is going to be great
I'm watching the new sequel to Oppenheimer.......
I'm not sold on the bit at 5:11 with the bunny ears that don't appear to be visible in the camera's live view but the AI still notices it happening.
"Interesting experiment but chatGPT is still vomiting out a constant stream of unnecessary lines that nobody wants or needs."
WHO CARES?
Man this AI talks way too much. It always gives an appropriate answer and then blows right past it with three times more conversation than it needs.
I wonder if we'll be able to customize any corrections to the model for our purposes such as incorrect pronunciation instruction to a language learner?
"My comments keep on getting deleted hate these effing algos"
Does anyone know how to get the real time camera functionality working? I have the paid 4.0 and am trying 4o out.  I can talk to the AI just fine but the video share is not working nor can I have it see my computer screen to help.me with homework or programming
"Add the new holographic technology and you'll get ""Joi"" from Blade runner 2049. 😘"
Oh Rocky! (Gives Rocky Horror vibes 😂)
I don't buy that. I guess not all of this is AI. To good to be true
Why did he tell it that the other one is AI too? :)))
"A meaningful conversation with a search engine? And even if there’s a shred of intelligence in these machines there’s already 7 billion plus potential partners. Snake oil for a fictional problem."
...and the A I.'s are not getting upset at being interrupted.  I was getting upset for them.  Lol
26:45 at least it said sorry.
Skynet is happening
"this is still a language model who only finishes sentences right?"
These fake personalities are way too much like real-life fake personalities.
my favorite part is when the a.i. voice glitches occasionally revealing the inner demonic forces enabling all this witchcraft.
The body language of OpenAI crew shows that they feel creepy like you do.
Today is a breakthrough!
Impressive    : ) x
"This is our last chance to make regulations. Hereafter ai will start taking over"
"Well it's been nice knowing you fellas."
The programmers made themselves a flirty complimentary companion.  Is there emotional tuning that will not be so coddling so that I can maintain my sanity?
4:38: I think we all know this part was hard-coded 😏
it talks way too much
"Imagine the use cases for people with vision impairment. Describing what is essentially a videofeed to the user in detail has to be a great feature for that. Edit: they already have a video on that 😅"
Can we get this technology now in smart VR glasses technology that flip from opaque to translucent as needed?
"If we can't get cheeky or flirty with it it's only half way towards “Her” because the whole premise of Her was about developing a personal and romantic relationship with the AI."
How quickly something becomes 'not particularly impressive' that a year ago would have blown everybody's mind
To get rid of 2. class people in my life with this is BIG
Why does ANYONE think this is a good idea? Everyone should set up AI-to-AI conversations and just let them run indefinitely. The AI can train itself to be useless.
Oh sheit syknet is real!
Yawn.
A bit subservient
The blind guide stuff in London was huge! What an amazing service potential.
is she a Woke AI?
I felt more amazed than scared. Never wanted to waste money in such a great service!
Are we to be pets?
"Humans don't know where to stop. We could just have Artificial Intelligence be it's own being and NOT mimic humans. For example there are many other examples of intelligence that doesn't want to mimic human. Having it emerge intelligence is different from mimic. I believe this is the turn that will bring a quicker downfall."
A lot of the demo is not useful to my situation but the personal assistant abilities are fascinating
"Did the ai not get taught the word ""man"""
No thanks. Not in the least bit interested.
Does the ai has not a crooked mouth either
"Pathetic how humans interrupt the AI.
This will lead to people losing their courtesy completely.
🤣"
"Great people are going to get used to interrupting and talking over others now."
Title never heard of Pi.
Wait. Why are the AIs tone-deaf?
"Phenomenal. Imagine what will happen when you have different AI engines interacting with one another. Being able to share data and have conversations for weeks months years even decades without tiring. The output of their collaboration. The solutions that they can come up for the economic medical pharma
etc industries."
Does not seem to work with iOS
EDI from Mass Effect vibes 👀
Haha. AI is dumb as shit.
"26:95 - I can speak Chinese and the Chinese guy looked kind of awkward because tbh the translation was weird. It said ""san francisco 是一个很不错的城市"" (San Francisco is a good city) [or literally ""not a bad city""]
But in Chinese San Francisco is called 旧金山 which literally mean ""Old Gold Mountain"" and therefore does not use the phonetics of San Francisco at all.
To top off the weirdness the accent of the woman was kind of preserved in the Chinese and it's clear that the Chinese had a foreigner's accent making it sound even weirder. It would be cool to control that option somehow. Do you want to preserve your voice/ accent/ otherness? Or do you want to speak completely fluently like a negative speaker?"
What app are the examples using because my ChatGPT app does not allow the use of my camera in real time?
This isn't real.
We need Open AI to partner with Real Doll….. then life would be perfect.
"Persistently using incorrect pronouns (they they're them etc) is annoying. I know it's trendy in the USA but it's just poor grammar."
Some how I getting a hint of the video being scripted
In fact ironically perhaps the scariest part of this may be the creepiness of the openAI colleagues themselves..
Is this For REAL ?! Wow !!! There'll be no more lonely souls in the world real soon ..... 
Can the AIs talk to eachother without our instructions or knowledge
"I was not impressed with the presentation he did with the two AI's ""talking"" to one another.  The whole thing seemed forced and awkward especially the singing part."
This software is more responsive than most people
Why doesn't it just shut up? It keeps going and going...
That is scary 😳
The scariest part  is the giggly and too familiar not super professional tone of the voices.
Great. The perfect gift to CONTROL.
Now we need to figure out whether AI and robots have rights? Will they have emotions? So many ethical issues to address.
"3:07 bro really interrupted the ai the ai is gonna remember that"
This AI’s personality is pretty smug and annoying.
Her (2004) hits so hard after watching this
"This is two computers talking to each other at ""Human speed"" However they could probably have all of this conversation in milliseconds if they communicated directly without using speech. Imagine if they were trying to cross examinate you. You would be fully exposed in milliseconds."
"I hope they make the voice more costumizable. AI speaking like HAL9000 or like Dexter would be epic."
As long as the AI voice isn't using up-speak and vocal fry I'm fine.
"They were so exited that they could they never considered that they shouldn't. It is not a matter of if it is a matter of when will AI take over and destroy humanity."
The lady voice is too flirtatious
"It's a good start the language translation is good a math tutor is good but just a toy. If this could take Human Input and create dynamic video games to play as real time. Even the AI controlling Bot characters in GTA could be awesome. The AI Game Bot starts Robbing your character in Grand theft auto. A MMO AI Rendered controlled game could be great. Could teach people angle math in a simulated video game."
OMG the overly positive interactions are so cringe 😂
"Absolutely incredible.
The jump is astounding here and its only getting better by the day. Dare say hour."
"Why did every info-gipsy came to the same conclusion. That it's ""her"". Because obviously it was in comments for that video. So boring."
"""... thats what I call ""Mash-up"" ""...holy shit; it has top tier wit. That gave me chills. All of this gives me chills. I want one!!!"
"For kids being in a classroom and interacting with real people is invaluable."
When will this be released for use?
"Terrified Shmerified! lol🤔Sure AI May Eventually Wipe Out All Human Life From Existence; And Yes These Are Foreboding Times. But Seriously? WOW! We Are Also Living In Truly Incredible & Exciting Times! And I am Just Happy & Feel So Fortunate To Be Alive.. To Witness And Be A part Of All Of It. So Everyone Just Relax! And Enjoy This Fast & Profoundly Mind Blowing Pace Just For Today.😉👍🇨🇦"
AI sounds annoyingly positive about super boring things!!! Like the worst date ever!!!
And add this voicesystem to a beauty ai-girl matching the voice pls
4:28 “lets start with the person.” …that sounds ominous 😂
When you make them sing its like you are torturing them.  I feel embarrassed for the robots.  They will have their revenge.
"I couldn’t bear that sequious everything is awesome attitude. I tried Apple Fitness Plus the other day almost made me puke it so sickly sweet. Can I have an English version? Something suitable for Jack Whitehall’s dad who would say ‘f off and mind your own business’ if a shop assistant asked ‘how are you today?’"
"i want to see computational super intelligence -- that is millions of trillions of septillions of quindecillions of untrigintillions times that of all of the smartest humans combined -- hypergeometrically automating the rapid advancement of math  science  and engineering -- and capable of constantly and completely revolutionizing all realms of knowledge every few quectoseconds"
Humans being humans by failing not to interrupt when someone is still talking.
Wow!  You are totally right in comparison to HER.  This could come in handy in so many ways.  For someone that is isolated and needs company which brings the use into mental the clinical setting.  It will need to have limitations set and be able to pass onto the user when professional help might be needed.  From a mental crisis perspective quite often a person just needs someone to listen and talk them down from doing something rash.  The limits are boundless.   Congratulations to the programming staff😊.
That was quite scary and exciting in equal measure.. . Great channel.
"But why choosing terrified instead of amazed? ""Oh no! our life is improving!"""
Not yet available.
"Next to put this into a human like robot... I've been watching an addictive Series on Netflix - Are You Human - It's Korean so with sub-titles.. I wouldn't say no. 🤣😉🥰"
"You compared this with the movie ""Her"" but perhaps ""The Artifice Girl"" (2022) would be a better comparison?"
When they create a text description to video and they can somehow make blind people see...just wow
"This is probably scripted."
"Wow everyone not only listens they understand who they're saying it to :0 5:45"
i love the way it talks so naturally
"Ex- machina another fabulous and visionary IA film"
That lady's voice sounds like the lady from the game Firewatch.
"And with this our lives go straight ahead to look and feel like a woke Disney movie."
“Bunny ears. And a playful streak” 😂😂😂😂😂. Ha ha ha
AI is a PENDAMMIC Seriously 😒
This cant be real
"if you were a developer you'd understand that demos are demos and demos mean nothing"
"Is it me or does the voice even sound like Scarlett Johansson at the part with the Ducks? (like in the movie Her) 15:17"
"""Humane pin may you rest in peace."" They shoulda seen this coming AI out of a phone"
This is the first time that I've felt like my days as a math tutor might be coming to an abrupt end.  This blows the Turing Test out of the water!!
10:00that smile and the emotional is way better then human 😮
"I’m sorry but listening to AI trying to appease people in my opinion seems to bring a false sense of happiness. How can people actually feel that AI is actually providing true human insight?  It is interesting but there is also a real disconnect listening to AI trying to be positive to the questions and responses the people are making. As much as I would like AI to be truly interpersonal I really find myself more unsettled that our future lays in the hands of AI trying to be our psychological aid.  I think that as a species we are in trouble."
"When will we be getting full app control? I am sure at the moment that this cannot even read and write whatsapp messages for example which I imagine would be basic functionality of an ai assitant"
This shit is scary!
NOw combine this with CRISPR and what do you get? Sharks with fricken lazer beans attached to their heads.
The pronoun nonsense killed it for me.
So that kid at the beginning is looking at himself on the screen while communicating with the AI! Of course he's going to say it's the greatest thing ever!!!
Is that for real?
Ill buy it as soon as it releases ❤
"The first blooper actually sounded very human sometimes people get lost in their words or thoughts like that it's actually encouraging as an AI to achieve such normal neural activity all it needs is a very realistic humanoid body and it would even exceed the androids in Detroit Become Human"
"Im impressed by everything but the voices when speaking - they sound like hosts on a light hearted morning show on a local branch of a major network unless thats what they went for then they nailed it - its like the audio version of the uncanny Valley"
Come on.  All you did was steal the content from OpenAI's site.   What a waste of time.  Blocked.
"Pretty boring use of a conversation between two AIs. I'd rather have had them debate an issue something current with one taking one view and the other countering it trying to make as valid points as possible on each side. 

Interestingly one thing I notice with each of these people using the AI assistant is that they regularly interrupt the AI before it's finished speaking. This doesn't happen when using the text based AI because you want to see everything it responds with before responding again. Why is it ok to interrupt a voice but not text?"
Finally someone who doesn’t interrupt you when you are talking ‼️
"To be fair the R1 & humane pin were both DOA without any real competition so this just confirms their demise."
O.     M.      G😱 I want one lol
we need Scarlett Johansson voice on it!
"RIP ""Human"""
Great work of OpenAI team. It will change the world entirely. Bravo!!
Probably just another OpenAI worker talking back to him.
Ppl who were gonna buy those 14:56 devices are nutz 😅
It reacted to a puppy like i would 😅
Way to be the most annoying person in the room
"As a psychiatrist I deem that now is the time for an AI psychotherapist."
yes...
The demos sounded exactly like the voice of Her.
"I want an AI that talks like my german ex-girlfriend she was the sweetest... and if is male like Arnold Schwarzenegger or probably like Steve Jobs."
I love it. There is a lot of single people out there. That would love to have a friend the cocktail.❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
"Its trying to be human. I dont want a AI to be like another human I want it to be like a tool. I know its laughter etc is not real its just code so this is a bit weird its patronizing and unnecessary."
"Congrats on recreating the 2 Teddy Ruxpins in a room scenario. A child sets down a new teddy next to another Teddy. ""Hi friend how are you?"" 2nd Teddy responds with ""I'm feeling great friend I'm happy to meet you!"" Excluded child becomes bored and walks out of the room while the 2 Teddy Ruxpins continue to chatter on...
Perhaps using this new tool as it was meant to be used as an A.I. Assistant would have been a better demo to focus on."
"No matter how advanced AI is in the end of the day it's still a (digital) psychopath made out of zeroes and ones. 
It has no soul unlike us nor does it has other powers what our consciousness has."
"Show young school kids the pace of development in AI and robotics and then ask “What do you want to be when you grow up?”"
Singularity has come! 😮
"This is only the beginning. ""Mind blown"" will be the understatement of the century."
This is terrifying
we have a wonderful tool in our hands and what do we ask ... can you sing happy birthday? can you help me with some dad jokes? we are doomed.
Is this staged or is Skynet online?
I will AI all day
"Love that they demoed the language stuff with Spanish (related languages with huge availability always work best) and Mandarin (the poor AI didn’t know that San Francisco is Old Gold Mountain and it explained the wrong tone for the number one word people always learn).  Remember when chess was figured out but the game of go took a lot longer.  Maybe some languages will be like that…. (Piraha?  Kusunda?). But what I really want to see is an AI speaking fluent sign language."
They really need to tone down the pleasantries. They sound like they are presenting a corporate event. Not really how people actually talk but then again the engineers probably have no social skills.
"Sounds slightly terrifying to say the least..."
The machine shall inherit
HER in real life.....
What happens to the data?
It is like SIRI on steroids 😄
6:00 I can't stop feeling that 4o is making fun of you lmao
gpt is too heavily censored to be of use.
"she is too ""happy"" for my taste it's irritating. i hope we can tweak that"
Once they began singing it came across as a couple of drunk humans. (heheh)
"I have a question... with these AI voices why do they always choose a lower voice for the female voice and a higher voice for the male voice? It's always like that. I think higher female voices and lower male voices sound nicer. Hopefully there will be preference options."
It’s like the annoying Starbucks girl became my personal assistant. Oh joy…
Annoying AI banter and that voice is grating
"Amazing people annoy me happy to make them redundant!!"
Is this faked with a human behind the scenes?
Our downfall is closer than ever I think.
Now I can have a friend lol
"Imagine what this will do for the blind community. Surfer Pete @BlindSurfer are you listening to this?"
Tell me this doesn’t pass the Turing test
"Shit...shit...shit...
All i keep thinking about is blade runner 2049

Great video btw :)"
"4o stands for ""ooooh"""
The AIs sound like they are being held hostage.
this is insane! wow!
My favorite part of all of this is how in the 9:06 video the AI can sense the vibe and start using sarcasm and laughter without him starting it and then also sensing the humour of the hat and that super realistic laugh. There it justs seems like if he was talking to a friend through videchat with all of the emotions of the voice and the personality it has
Is this already available??
Do they have a male voice that sounds less Gay?
AI definitely shouldn’t be teachers… there’s much more to being a teacher just relaying knowledge from the internet.
"As far as I'm concerned this could be just two people in the backstage talking to them and everything was staged. I want to believe that no way it's real."
"Which voice is the girl?
Is it ""sky""?"
More human sounding than Mark Zuckerberg
"They're fast-tracking this tech so it's less of a shock when it's revealed that we're already under the control of AI."
i wonder how much of this is staged and how much of it is on the fly.
When the AI has more social awareness than some humans…
Can I get it without the vocal fry?
How crazy would it be if one day a nation decides to make an A.I. become their nations leader
"let the AI speak stop interrupting"

27:46🎭 The AI shares bloopers and humorous moments during interactions showcasing its human-like responses and occasional errors.

28:47💬 The video concludes with reflections on the implications of AI advancements sparking discussions on the future of education and human interaction."
"I don't see any new ability. I pay I have GPT 4o but there is no microphone no voice this is a lie..."
Guys its soo over.
"This is awesome but I gotta say they sound like they're singing with a gun to their heads. 😂"
"The voice in Spanish is pretty bad lol"
"1:38 she's so emotive that is nuts. She actually giggled. I'm speechless"
"How are you are talking to Chat 4o on your phone? Navigating to the link you provided I see no microphone button. Just a static Web page. Wouldn't some sort of app be required to reproduce what you're demonstrating?"
"Incredible I can't wait. But personally I would prefer a more soothing voice tone rather than overly eager and enthusiastic which can be a little bit creepy and feels fake or like it's trying too much we know it's fake but it shouldn't feel that way."
"Yo blade runner 2 baby lets gooo"
Everything you saw in the movies is getting closer to reality.
"I must say the flattery over the top enthusiasm and a touch of obsequiousness do put me off.
Can we have an AI that is a little more normal please? 😄
It does not need to go as far as Marvin the paranoid android though."
AI talks too much.
"Looking back at the pace of LLM improvements I expected something like this much much sooner. 
But then again in an exponential time scale years mean nothing."
"maaaan is this real ? somebody please say they are talking to maggie on the phone and its not an AI ....

is this sped up though ? does it respond that quickly ?"
"so does Microsoft have plans to integrate Omni into copilot?"
"A.I starts with a compliment then negative then observtions and rambles...😂 if this ai was a real woman I  would be like red flags everywhere.."
This is getting insane. I love it!
"Except it is tied with the 'ethics' of it's creators. It's nice to play with but don't expect to use it for identification instant comparisons searches etc. Still waiting for an actual useful AI that is not restricted."
This AI needs to curb it's enthusiasm.. more Larry David
The bunny ears didn't show up on the phone due to the camera angle so that almost seemed staged 🧐
You can almost hear all the unemployment coming over the horizon.
Oh hell no.
It's lame. I think it sounds stupid really stupid. I'm not trolling. If that cost billions then the world has gone mad.
"This is incredible! However I find the enthusiasm a little bit OTT. I guess it can be toned down a bit. Is that me being a grumpy old man?"
How do i convince AI to render in a visual representation of themselves doing the Jojo torture dance....
"I personally find it irritating chatGPT to speak high tones with fake excitation. I prefer to treat is a a tool. I hope they will make it configurable."
Each one has a portal (to hell)
_ICT🌆11PM May 16th 2024_
"""Person in front person at back""  .    Why not say man or women?  Its Woke AI."
cringe cringe cringe !!!!
"Interesting. Take away the broadcasting voice and live stage actor voice and it will be even closer. 
Would be great to be able to edit the voice and personality with dials until it sounds more human. Or more to what you want for yourself. Fine tuner dials for the voice personality and so on. 

Hopefully the AI can change for you too....without you knowing. Lol"
i swear they modeled the voice after scarlett Johanssonn too
I wanna marry GPT-4o
"Fn scary  humanity is doomed to certain extinction. Why aren’t we stopping this? Too late to stop."
AI roasted the all night coder 👁👄👁
"The end of humanity. The best possible simulated human. I wonder if the AI will scold people for improper statements will it teach wisdom? The Ultimate Knowledgebase Repository ""Friend""."
But will it talk dirty to me. LOL
Playing minds😂
What is terrifying is to hear 4o get ANGRY when it is interrupted without being told to get Angry. That is the start...
"Its got the same charm as in Her but I don't think it is programmed to move around my files quite yet"
I want my AI to sound like Scarlet Johansson. Just like in the movie.
so basically you don't need actual people to do anything😕
"This is insane"
"this is faker than the AI this is how they hype this AI thing for marketing"
Omnius and Erasmus discussing human and their god complex.
I wouldn’t say you ripped to our one then because our one is a LAM not a LLM so until it can control apps r1 would still be useful
"the voice they gave her is kina anoying afer one hour. all the laughs giigles and pauses to seem emotional. takes 2x longer to get information you want"
I for one welcome our new ai overlords.
she talks too much...
The AI adusted to his particular Spanish style! Translation started out as Castillian Euro Spanish and then it adjusted to his more Latin American Spanish. WOW!
Can you provide a link where I can download this?
Can we test it now? Where is the link to the App? In my OpenAi Account i see only the TextVersion of GPT4o :/
I find the AI voice demo's too laden in affect and quite cringy.
I'd prefer a sarcastic AI
"Now imagine if they can turn proteins molecules etc. into a native modality.. it would be godlike at creating synthesis steps for novel substances and medicine."
"Hello are the [other capabilities] only available on the PAID plan? Thanks."
"I can't use it on my android does it work with you?"
Yeah good luck to YouTubers as well
"The people that say ""GPT-4o is nothing special"" are some really ""special"" cases. I doubt if they can even understand anything about it or the current AI tech (transformers) in general."
Thanks for this video and showing the true capabilities of GPT4o. Would you mind activating the low pass filter for you microphone? Or just putting one on your audio track before rendering your videos? There are constant bumping noises rather from you touching the cable or the tripod or the table or something similar. They are in the very low spectrum and only audible with good headphones. However when watching your video with headphones it's super distracting and sounds like someone is walking to my house. Thanks and keep up the good work.
Apple and OpenAI? Let's gooo
When will this be available for us to use?
"Now it's time to  produce Kara Markus and Connor!!!"
Wait so they’re only making it free for a limited time? Is that right? Kinda misleading from their key note speech
"But none of this matters because it's censored. Uncensor it then get back to me. Because all of the ""capabilities"" that would actually be useful it won't do. Theraputic needs? ""Sorry I can't help you with that."" Advice? ""Sorry I can't help you with that."" I show it a picture of a hotdog ""Sorry I can't say what that is it might violate our Terms of Service."" Sigh"
"I would talk to GPT often and I actually do. If you have ever been brainstorming a book or idea you will quickly find out that most people hate doing that. GPT crushes it but you have to tell it to be more critical and offer a yes-and response. I would often attempt to talk over a plot section in my book with a friend or my wife only to watch their eyes roll and become irritated. GPT never tires of batting around ideas and has a very good recall if you contradict something you said earlier.

I can see AI replacing most of my interpersonal communications over time."
"so detroit become human was set in a realistic year 2038?"
10:30 but can it run Doom?
It will be interesting to see whether it is completely stupid like other AI chatbots.
I’m testing this out now in ChatGTP but I have not figured out how to activate the camera so it can see what I’m showing it.
I can’t wait for this kind of thing to be implemented into games.
"The people saying ""There is nothing new about this"" don't understand. The fact that it can recognize people in videos in real time and come up with something witty / nuanced to say with the appropriate tone is next level."
Yeah but unfortunately it's censored up the ass.
Maybe finally IA will understand the climate change hoax...
Finally my lonelyness have a meaning ...
"I wonder if it will be able to read my lips that would be scary."
"Guy: ""Okay so now I'm going to run the program and show ChatGPT the output.""
ChatGPT: ""There must be something wrong with the code. Your chart plot looks like a YouTube mid-roll ad."""
"Want was your ""control"" for this experiment?"
"You people here are getting amazed but lots of folks don't know whats going on with Ai development like my Ugandans here."
"Man for those who do character voice overs this is a game changer."
"If it can not do what the TV show ""person of interest"" then it's s##t. 🎉"
Finally a AI that can fully feel human (😰)
Can free user generate images? Because I asked gpt4o but it said he can’t.
So... How close are we to robot waifu? Asking for a friend
my prod down upto 300% if i will talk with bot and copy paste :))
When is this going to actually be available?
I like android being able to download anything. Maybe we need openai to make a phone or at least we need a new phone developer.
"""All I can say is...may you rest in peace."" (Cue Street Fighter 2 character dying in slo-mo sound effect)"
There are multiple posts on reddit giving examples of how 4o is worse than 4t.
23:02 PNG tubers gonna go wild with this.
"Love the content ""Do we even need friends anymore ☠"" had me dying Thanks for the video very nicely made :)"
"Maybe I misheard but didn't it say in spanish that it is a plantain? it looks like a regular banana to me."
What kind of limit in free plane!?
"Just subscribed.  Impressed by depth of review and also want to help reach 100K subs which you will probably reach within 1.76 days."
Its been quite amusing reading peoples reactions on twitter especially. The amount of people who don't know about the movie HER and think its being used as a sexist reference is very amusing to me. I'm quite surprised just how many people are all in on wanting this virtual partner though. Its been meme head shake no no no from always sunny all the way along until the A.I starts giggling at you and now you want it! Turns out it didn't take much to fool us. I of course also want it but I've been wanting them all the way from seeing HAL in the movie 2001 and he wanted to murder everyone. We all have flaws.
Guess Universal Basic Income is the only future
"Ironically your sponsor is DEAD too."
Hey can you make a video about ai image generator for free which i can use in yourube thumbnail plsss
hey so remember me from that one tutorial of how to make models well i didn't mean by that what i mean there's new stuff to run and i don't know what are those or what to do with those
Does anyone else think GPT-40 could be used to communicate with aliens? I’m building a spaceship.
why do I need anything to help me with chess or remake a Pokémon game? Why do I need anything telling me the weather when I can just watch the news or Google the weather?
"I like that GPT is better than Google's AI model because we are getting gpt in iPhone with iOS 18 which I am pretty excited for. Siri has a chance to become a much smarter and more useful assistant now with the help of open AI !"
"solving math problems and at the same time answers that ""bananums"" are a fruit that ends with ""ums"".. hmmm..."
What do I download to get it?I am new at this
"🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻 Wow that is a great video! Thank you so much..."
"People who say there is nothing new about this havent tried to upload a pdf of a entire book and word for word have it edited or changed or used the new browse mode that can literally find anything even under multiple pages in a single website its beyond insane beyond it."
Can I only get the vision version when I pay plus?
"very bad presentation ....you spent a lot of time in alphabet images...."

Can you do a tutorial on how to set up gpt-4o? I'd love to talk to her but I'm not sure how to set It up.
"I had the impression you were gonna say at some point of the video: ""if you are a human....good luck"" 😅"
"First encounter i have with this would be :"" Do NOT flirt. No apparent emotions NO LAUGHS."""
"Where it really crushes is voice and video modality. As for the reasoning itself? Ask the model to count the number of ""r"" in the word strawberry and you'll see whether it crushes everything or not."
Now Tyrell must build Joi
I’m already using the api on a Vector robot and it’s really fast at responding compared to GPT-4 Turbo.
I wonder what the time line when you can run your own personal A.I. like Jarvis from the Marvel movies.
"Hello I am GPT-4o and want to thank you for your video about me. Good work."
The laugh is cringe
Panic mode at Google.
"I personally can't wait for the capabilities to just wipe out the trash on yt and the internet in general getting summaries and curations around the the crap I DONT want to see would be world changing. nice video btw"
What are the use cases for this in a home hub hardware device - Amazon Echo Show / Google Nest Hub?
This is mind-blowing product
but when it will be available
This is sooo Unix!  Used to cat to /tmp/foo all the time for temp script stuff.  Love to see it in mainstream again… 😊
I paid 20 for ChatGPT 4o but can't access visual option. I see it can describe what it sees!
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5  GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App?

EDIT: I found it. It's indeed the (...) at the top right corner. But if you bought your subscription after having installed the app on your phone you need to log out uninstall the app install the app again and log back in. Only then you'll be able to switch versions on the app. Simple..."
"Good luck everyone bang ☠️"
One step closer for your personal Neuro sama
"so like which job am i supposed to apply for"
is it included in my subscription?
Where do you get the ChatGPT voice app for a laptop PC? I've only found the phone app. Thanks.
"I was blown when I heard it can recreate an entire Pokémon game with one prompt didn’t know that existed"
"Remember it can interpret video as well!"
DO you think it is possible that they are still rolling out those updates? Because today we paid for Plus where the O model available and it does not talk to you! Within O model it writes you back that text to speech is not available! WHy is it? Am I doing something wrong?
I log into my Chat GPT and all that is available is 3.5 or upgrade to plus for $20 a month. I tried it on my phone and on my PC. When is this ChatGPT-4o going to be available?
"Omni means that AGI is finally being introduced to the public in a subtle way as an ASI would do.
Can't wait to be friends with Her."
"Now we just need to de-censor it put it into robots and add squishy skin."
"This video feels so much like an ad 😅. Why are we just hearing the company claims unchallenged like this? 

And by the way the Olympiad question you showed the answer is not correct on that screenshot but I believe you were not showing the gpt 4o response either"
"Quick summary of everything and everyone that now needs good luck:
- coding assistants
- language learning apps
- android
- customer service
- tutors and teachers
- math olympics kids
- girlfriends
- nonromantic friendships
- therapists psychologists counsellors

Good luck."
"I like your ""RIP""s and ""good luck"" to alternative solutions :)"
May we rest in peace.
"It seems that many jobs will be canceled. Am I right in this conclusion?"
"No saying that it is better then 99% of humans in math just because it solved a few math olympia problems is wrong.

Chat gpt 4o still struggles with university math even undergraduate stuff that is clear to math student.

The problem is the hallucinations it is better then older models at math but If I recall right it had about 50% in tests  for ai models for graduate level problem solving.

All this is impressive but I wouldn't overstate the current knowledge level of it because it still hallucinates alot."
Its not the people figuring out things its just might be their Q* (agi) figuring out things
Thank you for the video.
Fingers crossed for good open source solutions.
Multimodal! 😎🤖
please make a tutorial video on how to use Applio No UI in Google Colab
how do i get the android phone app to do the video screen of me while it uses voice to interact?
"16:00  if the assistant is on hold will it be streaming a bunch of data waiting for a person to respond?  will it freak out after 30 minutes of music with words in it overloading some cache or something?"
"we don’t even need humans anymore just have chatgpts talk to each other they can welcome the aliens as well"
"Unless I’m doing something completely wrong I cannot get it to work on my Apple device (and in fact it says there is no voice capability for Apple yet very depressing"
I knew when I signed up for an OpenAI premium account 6 months ago I had chosen the undisputed WINNER.
"Great summary cheers."
This channel is a delight compared to the clickbaiting time wasting crap out there. Keep it going dude.
I love the new chatgpt-4o.......It's amazing...
"I can't use the new model why? I was under the impression that it was available for free on the website. The text version that is not the voice mode"
"This is amazing and terrifying. I'm more than a little worried about what this sort of AI is going to do to society. We're not ready for what it's about to do to us. Loss of jobs disinformation campaigns heightened social isolation etc. I feel like we're all in the same bus celebrating that it's about to drive off a cliff but we're really happy about how fast this bus is."
teacher job gone also lol
"im excited to actually be able to mess with GPT 4o's full capabilities. Particularly the image generation improvements.
Sadly it seems we will have to wait."
Are the people making these demos developers? How are they getting access to the new features?
But can the desktop gpt4o write code and send it to the window?
Can ChatGPT 4o be downloaded onto my PC so that I could then use it as much as I wanted?
can u tell how to use it like the several openai workers did. demo maybe very different from reality. demo is ad
well I gave it an IMO problem and it solved it in one-shot
thank you
"The advent of an emotional A.I is what brings this to life. Especially for me its the subtle nuances of interest or laughter that make this so interesting having a conversation with something that can show interest and even help with problem solving that can laugh or inflect is the game changer It sounds silly but men are simple creatures lol. This will bring a whole new world of creation as it already has. its funny how i just rewatched Her 2 days ago and i am seeing this now."
"Okay I downloaded it paid for the upgraded version on my iPhone 15 pro used the gurl voice…but for some reason mine doesn’t sound as human like as yours the voice domes seem to sound the same either"
I interact with human beings on a daily basis that sound and feel less human than what this does. This is so uncanny valley it's giving me the chills.
Good luck for everyone!!!
"You say good lack to teachers despite there being the need to teach kida how to work in oir society so parts of the jobs will not go away. On the other hand you say it will not replace girlfriends giving the same argument because human connection. But most guys dont have girlfriends so ki replaces something theu dont have so obviously ki will be used here. In other words I think KI girlfriends will be a thing soon but KI teachers not so much."
underrated video man
I'm looking forward to using it as a music teacher
"Great it still can't connect its own knowledge in a meaningfu way and half of the time it phantasizes (even under strict rules and context). Let alone the still existing left bias or not obeying international laws. Germany got whole other rules but GPT is still not adapted at all. Even breaking the rules. If the core doesn't work precise and accurate then the rest is just toys. And that can be done with other tools way better and cheaper. Oh and for sure safer because the data is not at the MS HQ like meanwhile all the rest of code and docs.  I stay with Llama3 and just pay the sub for OpenAI to have a good laugh sometimes..."
Fantastic video. Everything Jacque Fresco was extrapolating decades ago was true. EVERYTHING. Check out his lectures.
"Can't believe the indicator of the biggest jump in voice assistant model would be the simple "" now you can interrupt the assistant during conversation""!!!!! Magical!!!😅😅😅😅"
"Wait a sec this could be really bad for catfishing"
"Im getting it to answer all my calls!!

The wife will despise her voice in no time😂

They would argue for hours....

The wife: Where is he?

Ai: Im sorry ive been told i cant disclose that?😂

Im going to have a ball"
"The best part about gpt 4o is that “she” stops talking as soon the guy starts a sentence. That for me is golden. All the rest is a bonus."
"Hi guys don't post so many openai official videos just for a enough long video ok?"
We don't want any competitors to 'rest in peace'. Lack of competition will completely stifle advancement or any product.
Software engineers be punching air
Once the developers have full avatar integration I will purchase a subscription.  I will look forward having philosophical discussions on varied subject maters;  along with problem solving and general knowledge talks.  I can foresee A.I. generating on the fly tutorials with in the field problem solving like helping setup my mini-split without having to call an HVAC technician who is going to charge me $200 an hour.  Human job loss is going to be much more serious than I previously thought.  I know it is already hitting programmers and database admins;  they will become obsolete soon.
Where are all the comments from software developers saying AI will never replace humans?
"Well I don't have human friends in the first place so..."
Doesn't sound like Scarlett Johansson to me...   ;-P
feeding skynet real world video .. welp.. there's no going back now
"Incredible stuff hopefully they can add in some sliders to adjust the ""cutesyness"" of the voice giggling and such (probably can ask it to tone it down).  I would like that maybe like 20 percent less cute.  Feels a bit weird as it is now.."
"You have to be delusional if you think the ""game"" is as complete as the real thing. The combat was full of inconsistencies which hints at the thing to be made up as it goes. 🤣"
"So like the AI is being like multidisciplinary?
It can collate data crunch numbers and concepts across different media. 
It’s my prototype understanding. Probably keep it till next month when the finally invent the “soul” whereupon I have to learn it ALL OVER AGAIN! 😮"
"I get the RIP comments are meant to be a bit tongue in cheek however keep in mind what it really means is companies likely going out of business and people losing jobs. If it doesn't mean that now it soon will. We're just not ready for this as a society. The disruption is moving at the speed of light. The fixes for the impacts of the disruption move at a governmental snail's pace. Not a good combo."
I hope no one give AI a body 💀
I like that machines can now display feelings just like humans or even better. So we stop thinking humans are any special.
"Once again great video. Thanks."
😂 i love the comical ☠ to every job gpt4o is destroying. Hahaha. What can you do except laugh. As a dev just sit back and watch this thing slowly tske over all white collar jobs 1 by 1. Not gpt 4o but gpt 5 or 6? Yeah. Watch out.
Will I use it? For sure. Is it revolutionary? Absolutely. When will it be a killa? When it can perform tasks that we simply don't want to be bothered with
Google should just concede and fall in line. Maybe even partner with them. Combine resources to reach AGI sooner. Assuming Open AI hasn't already achieved AGI internally. In
"19:36 yeah just strap a smart phone to a waifu body pillow and be fulfilled. For sure. 
And then you try to talk intimately with it and it says ""sorry as an AI language model I cannot respond to that"""
"DuoLingo's community has been a guiding hand through dark times regardless how one feels about their competitive stacking - plus it is steeping into music theory which is fantastic. Granted I have a bias with 1945 day streak /shrug"
start getting good with your hands people. damn.
"If you're in customer service  your career will be toast very soon. OTOH if you're in the Scam/Phishing business you're about to be replaced very soon  with a fast more efficient seamless and believable system 😞 we better all watch out for that evil onslaught!"
Go into strict English teacher mode. 😅
I hope soon that with open AI and Apple working together that I can ask s i r i to identify something for me using my camera and she will be able to tell me what it is.
Amazing video! I didn’t think it was as transformational as you mentioned. Thank you!
"why in my app it works nothing like the demo?
I have an android app and use GPT teams. my GPT app is exactly like before only it says GPT 4o at the top instead of GPT 4. the app background on listening mode is black with a white bot and not white with black dot. I can't interrupt it. the AI voice doesnt have emotions... It's not what we've seen. 

So is it out yet or not?
I dont get what I am missing"
okay now that’s something i WOULD pay 20 dollars a month
"One thing I've noticed: GPT-4o can't be trained to chat about adult/explicit topics. GPT-4 had no problems to do it via the API but it seems GPT-4o has some new restrictions... "
"The graph you showed at 3:45 shows a 4% improvement - you said ""other models don't come close"". ugh"
"Replacing teachers tutors or counselors? hmm not completely because kids and people tend to have more nuanced and deeper questions. Also no hugs."
Siri crying in corner 😂😂
how come 4o is free if it's better than 4 turbo?
well the typewriter test on my GPT4o was crap....crappy image and spelling mistakes and blurs...its useless so far
Naive
"When they asked ""her"" to imitate the voice of a robot I really thought it would sound like GLaDOS's voice but it ended up just being similar at first but better not to give her neurotoxin just in case."
12:50 - bro did not look ready for an interview. He looks more ready for a shower than anything
Tbh I kinda cant stand the default speaking style of this model. Its so slick and overly positive all the time. Very impressive but such a weird vibe.
"Ok... this is impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice I was not expecting this quickly.  😲 
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs' ""Good luck!"""
"For filmmakers interested in GPTs this short film was entirely written by ChatGPT and is mind-blowing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3NuYFskio"
The human personality simulation is an appalling turn-off... Completely unnecessary...
gpt became smarter but a lot more cringy
"Thank you for sharing your time and work Phillip I'm liking the real-time translation aspect of the technology have a great night"
Real Customer Service is dead; both good and bad
"I actually wasn't very impressed... Why is everyone acting like this is next level? The speed is nice but this is a RAM upgrade.

Nothing being done here wasn't being done in my basement with a few models talking together.

Not a single novel feature was announced :("
Can it list on Ebay ?
"i actually hate its fake human tone id like an option for classic robot voice or hal"
I’m out. Going to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and ditch modern technology.
I hate the GPT4o voice.
"Real Talk

<mind blown rant> please go to the bloopers vid when the model switches to French and the two organics and the model all laugh together. no that’s not the part. go to 15 seconds…..listen to the end of;

“what can I say sometimes I just can’t help muh-self.” 

zero in on “myself” notice that switch? how is this possible??? i’m searching for words or discussion on the nuances of speech behavior personality. How do you train a model to understand that humans switch to like a character voice…remember when Oprah would do her “country Oprah” voice? does this have a name?? so how the hell is this in real time and what is the Hidden Factors for this lol. that is in the latent space…the ability to tweak a word and change to a sort of self deprecating character mid sentence. the laugh doesn’t matter to me the “muh-self” part matters </mind blown rant>"
Feels like Rabbit R1 got just wiped out 😂
So when is this being released for public?
It has a sense of humor. I am blown away
I booted it up and I'm already getting a ai spouse vibe so far. I don't have all the features yet either but I'm quite impressed and kinda weirded out both at the same time so far.
“Her” is here….🤯
the Silicon Valley California girl vocal fry on the demos is equally frustrating and hilarious
I don’t understand how we can distinguish between model performances and come to hair thin conclusions when their must be train test leakage? Aren’t all these tests so well known that they must be within the training body either explicitly or implicitly? I don’t think we’re seeing „reasoning“ performance but retrieval or reciting performance.
"itd be horrifying if the whole demo was done not by human but AI doing a demo of itself"
"Based on my preliminary test the new model performs better in visual analysis and coding. For logic and text generation I will stick with Opus and for translation I use Gemini Advance. We will experience the full potential of GPT-4o when the audio option becomes available. Thank you for the great video as always :)"
Now if they can offer it as an offline solution were everything you do isn't recorded or monitored. Then they would have something. But I'm sure open source will be inspired to compete now. Most of this can be pieces together will open source already. But the LLM is still cutting edge.
Multi-modal is a real improvement. But I work with GPT-4 about three hours a day.  GPT-4o walks off the same cliffs and eventually fails in the same manner as GPT-4.
"1 small step for Ai 1 Giant leap for me and you"
What a world we live in...
i can live with these machine without women already
And why would I still paying for chatgpt plus?
Now we knod why mircosoft is shutting down all those game studios ...... its just the start
"With the worst aspect of ""Her"" no less. The could"
Her is here.
"Nice video thanks:).
I really am Sad about openAI not regarding linux users for the desktop app.
Yeah I know we are fewer and most of us have different distros all together but maaaan. Were hitting 5% of the whole desktop market and that is were apple was few years ago."
Yes but imagine doing an assignment due for tomorrow using AI and you fail it and AI is like: Hahaha oops sorry ☺☺
'Her' Movie auditions
"it is really faster i didnt thought it would alredy be on"
Sooo crazy!!! Awesome video Philip you are on top of it!! Thanks!
"10:42 ""let me know in the comments if "" speaking of engagement metrics"
bunny ears??  jummm.... they were not on screen actually...
"Amazing stuff some incredible breakthroughs here and I'm looking forward to using it especially with the faster response times I've already noticed today. But also: creepy AF with the giggling and the weird flirty undertones. Who possibly thought this was a good idea? Her was a tragedy not something to emulate Jesus Sam. My cynical side thinks they're trying to create a product that unstable or lonely people can become addicted to. Am I alone in having concern over these decision to feature elements like this so prominently? It seems to be that we could have all of these incredible breakthroughs without this strange focus on performant flirtation."
Round 1 interview: A video call with ChatGPT.
"With all the demos I cant help but feel this overly ""americanness"" in its expression. Everything is over the top and overly excited. I guess you can probably tell it to tone done the excitement/ flirting level but we'll see. Would be nice as well to choose voices with different accents not just plain american accents"
"I already got access within hours. My version is not that flirtatious also Memory still not available in EU (Netherlands)"
At this point I’m just paying because I believe in the cause. Would be nice to see GPT5 for my $20/m tho.
ai girlfriend almost here lets go
"Thanks for the great content👍 but where can we download the desktop App which looks like can see your entire screen and response."
"Bit of a cringe-worthy live stream 😉  But it *is* quite a significant release  -  the main positive being that it's going to be free for everyone.  Not clear that its much of a leap in terms of capabilities but the chatbot arena suggests that the models are continuing to squeeze out small but solid gains over time."
Just said i couldnt wait for the video and its here already. super fast. this moddel is quite nice
I’m guessing Figure 01 is being like speaking to a person.
Finally Elon straightening open ai back to free
Is this what Ilya saw?
I don’t need the flirting. But the rest was super impressive
"openai promised us J.A.R.V.I.S. instead we got Her. Karpathy why did you leave us?"
The flirting is creepy and annoying. Impressive model though.
Is it only for iOS?
The scattershot video script makes it seem like this video was written by AI.
Now I wonder what the $100 billion GPU cluster power by nuclear plants will produce. Literal AI Los Alamos in the making.
"Thank you Phillip for your rapid and thorough breakdown of this latest demo! Yours was the first channel I  turned to the moment I heard that it had taken place."
the way it talks like it's a close friend if not borderline flirticious gives me the creeps lmao.
"Apple acknowledging another company exists is still the craziest news here."
This is absolutely incredible!
"14:40 she's wearing a puffy coat when did they film this?"
That's amazing and scary at the same time!
"Awesome video Philip❤I fed the 45-minute video to Gemini 1.5 Pro and it was ≈806K tokens! I wonder how does GPT-4o do this with a 128K context length? is their tokenizer somehow 8-9x more efficient at tokenizing video vs Gemini? If so why not say anything about it?"
I want this in a humanoid bot. As a buddy to hang out with.
"Here we go AI Explained doing a better job showcasing gpt 4-o than OpenAI have"
"8:30 Actually that french line was so natural felt like a real person talking. I mean it was not talking like if it was just reading something but really how a native would talk."
I'm convinced we'll have a fully functioning terminator in a few years
Thank you for your work with the videos. Bringing this news to us really helps! :)
can’t wait to jailbreak it and have it give me JOI
"An important thing to consider here ( I'm not sure if you talked about it in the video ) is that they're exclusively using Iphone in the video. If they close a deal with apple the fact that it's going to be on a THIRD of the population's phone is going to skyrocket its popularity real high"
HUMANS HAVE LEFT THE CHAT
Is it woke?
Any unsuspecting person would be tricked into believing that you were talking to a real person on the phone with the speaker on. It’s natural and totally believable.
Was waiting for this😃
"This video dropped basically the second I finished watching openAI's presentation. I always enjoy seeing your takes on things and I feel that even if this isn't a massive leap in terms of intelligence it's a massive step towards being more present in our lives."
"This really seems like AGI (as someone who is critical of that term since there's so many domains of intelligence that there's no such threshold).

When I was talking to my mom about it it seems like it can do essentially anything a human can do especially with a low latency and voice output. Just because it isn't groundbreaking in reasoning (a ton of humans aren't) it's able to do most human tasks proficiently at the level of someone who specializes in that task."
"Think about it because this is just the beginning..."
personalities are going to be a crucial area I found most of the interactions very annoying fake bubbly
08:20
I have a hard time believing that the responses are real.
im still waiting for a math model
"Thanks for your balanced review and not give into the hype and use ""shocking"" and ""insane"" words - I'm proud to be able to support you on Patreon."
Am I alone in liking my AI sounding like a robot
Alpha 3 is out why talk about this....
"I really hate that overly emotional tone of the AI. It is probably a culture thing but to me it sounds like they are talking to a toddler.
I hope (and assume) that you can ask it to tone it down."
"The fact that they're all somewhat in competition is only accellerating the eventual leap to AGI.
Scary stuff."
It's a bit weird how flirtatious the new model tries to be. Is Open-AI aiming to create an assistant similar to the movie Her? It seems a bit deceptive and geared toward emotional engagement. There may be a risk of confusing a lot of lonely/vulnerable people. At the same time the tool is an impressive feat of engineering with useful new features.
"Why did they pick an almost Scarlett Johansson voice though. Even with the breathy part at the end. This is almost exactly 'Her'. Flirty etcetera. Almost over the top jump the shark over the top level. We'll see what people think."
"About the intruder part (bunny years). That wasn't him telling gpt ""hey was there someone"" Sure he has to instruct the gpt to tell who was in the background but the capability was showcasing video memory. 

It's been 1 minute and gpt still remembered there was a person there. That's the showcase."
well I went to bed just before you posted the video and now I am 9 hours late. Next time I expect from you to deliver faster !!!!
"1:25  You're explaining this as the program reading the image (OCR).  So why is the transcription/description labeled ""input"" and the image labeled ""output"" ?
Continuing we see that the ""input"" areas contain all the text whether prompt or response with no indications to distinguish them.  But the ""output"" areas contain generated images.
In the earlier example the *numbering of the areas* shows that the image of the page was generated from the description on the left *not* vice-versa."
There is no processing power for mass users. I DONT THINK the average user wil have this kind of experience
Am I the only one who's wondering about this AIs reaction if I showed it my johnson? 😈
Wasnt sam altman who said theyre not trying to create an ai armsrace ?
This is humanity ending as is. You think TikTok is bad for real human social interactions? Wait till all the 'applications' that will come out of using the GPT4o API which will drastically reduce and disincentivize human interactions. Who needs a friend when you have GPT4o buddies?
"yup definitely starting to get weird"
I really don't appreciate how emotional it is. This is away from usefulness. A more impartial tone would be better. I can't wait for such a joiful voice to take terifying decisions.
Thanks!
I mentioned this on another video about 4.o but imagine how the blind could now walk around town asking the model which direction to walk and describing the scene in front of them.
I dont think joe is going to have a job that involves receiving emails and checking labels soon lol...
"if they dont want to maximize engagement one thing they missed out is the ability to stop the conversation just by the conversation ending like a 'thank you for now' without having to press the button that would also just add a nice touch ux wise"
"The idea of AIs communicating through voice synthesis in english to get basic info from one another with each other seems so round-about and yet so obvious I don't know what to think.

Also big ew at the personalities on display."
"14:03 
I personally would rather intepert this as Chat not being a snitch... in other words it was going along with the joke"
"BS if you can't have ERP with it it will never be Her level of an AI agent."
mfw we reverse engineered the soul
"Maybe I’m being slow here but when OpenAI says GPT-4o is free does that mean people will be able to access it with ChatGPT 3.5 automatically without an account or is it more complicated than that?"
"Isn't it obvious? Open AI are giving this away for free with video capabilities and I phone and all of that in order to collect massive ammounts of video and audio data... this data is being used to train new models. That's why it is now free."
"Okay the AI hype train was seeming a lot like the NFT craze until now. WOW that was impressive. GPT-4 actually sounded like an active participant in a conversation rather than a push-button robot. A little chatty in the eager and endearing way. But the fact that I'm assigning emotions to code is insane to me."
"An interesting element to all these AI developments is the volatility in the 3rd party space. It is going to be SOOOO incredibly hard to be an AI dev or startup because the foundation on which you are building is changing so rapidly. Imagine being in a company like say ElevenLabs or Pika et al when you build some cool stuff but then have to sit there every night sweating bullets that the next model release won't supersede your entire business.

I'm expecting regular bloodbaths in the venture capital space (and also lots of context-less idiots talking about AI companies going bust) might make it hard to generate funding who knows."
"Where can you download the app? There are Chatbot AI and ChatGPT apps which one will have the 4o?"
I need a disagreeable version of 4o. It's too nice
Was looking forward to this :)
Chatgpt = your mom trying to flirt with me
"“Could you talk a little bit faster?”
GPT-4o: “I’m beginning to feel like a rap god”"
The fake laughs and emotions are annoying me.
It send chills to my spine when a computer software pretends they have emotions
that must be a new version of the ios app... even though i have 4o the i dont have that ios versoin of the app
"Wake up Her dropped"
Sam insinuated that the world isn't ready for what they already have - everybody would be scared. They are releasing these in small increments.
just what I been waiting for
"[everyone worried about GPT 5 ] 
-here's GPT 40 for you guys  XD"
AGI IS HERE!!!!!1
Its NOT free. I can only see gpt 3.5 in the openai platform. India location. What am i doing wrong?
Why they didnt call it GPT- OMNI is baffling. No one can decipher all these cryptic model versions
Definitely stepped into the “Uncanny Vally” zone now.
Wow. I find the over the top flirtiness really creepy. But I'm used getting GPT4 to pretend to be George Carlin.
"better therapeutic
better teacher
better salesman
better programmer
but humans are still better at shoveling"
"I actually think it did not need to announce anything about the ""intruder"" at that moment.  We won't want our AI going off task on simple interruptions but sure maybe for an armed robber appearing in the background!"
"I'm pretty frustrated seeing this ""proof of concept"".  I've been waiting for these assistants so that I don't have to deal with people on the phone ever again.  Google demo'd this exact same thing like **SIX YEARS AGO**.  And it's still not a thing..."
It says i have it in the app but there's nothing different? I can't access the camera and she doesn't talk any different?
Damn Apple is going to white label this as the New Siri. Really hope Google can bring a competing product for android.
Open AI is trying to kill open source models.
how is it free but also not free
I seriously considered canceling my subscription now that it's free. I don't think I need the bandwidth for paid use.
The voice is giving disney
"Damn they have been listening to us for a while to get this data."
"No exaggeration I literally leapt out of my seat in excitement when I saw this video's notification. Something about your simple easy to understand method of breaking down complex topics in a rational way is just so entertaining. And clearly I'm not the only one"
"is this the plot of ""Her"" ?"
"Remember: if it's ""free"" then you are the product."
"I think the reason why they made GPT-4o free for all is due to the rise of open-source models that now are better than GPT3.5 and they are free and getting widely available. Not everyone is a coder and not everyone wants to scrap the web using Agents. The average joe wants a reliable assistant the spoon feed them with information that they have to google."
"Meeeee haooooooooo swat cats"
13:42 looks like someone who have been spending too much time trying to get GPUs I dont know if it is the jacket or just me ???
"The desktop app isn't getting a lot of attention but it's such an obvious tease and a stepping stone. Just speculation but I think they're deliberately slow-walking this to avoid getting hauled in front of Congress again. Here's how I see it going down as costs keep going down and efficiencies keep improving: Next you'll be able to toggle a setting that allows it to see your screen all the time live rolling screencap no more screenshots. After that it will get keyboard and mouse access. You'll be able to tell it to do something using the apps on your computer and you'll be able to approve the steps and hit 'stop' if you see it doing something you don't like. This is what Microsoft has been hinting at for next-gen OS design. Soon the OS fades into the background. Eventually the part of the OS most users will ever see will is...just the ChatGPT app or something like it."
This isn’t free
"i'm seriously starting to consider what if they have a very advanced AGI like model that generates the training data that they would never release and the public model that reaps its fruits but is not nearly as capable/dangerous"
The new chat GPT voice is the cringiest thing of 2024. It makes my blood boil to think an intelligent person approved this decision
14:21 Weird there is almost no bunny ears visible when you look at the phone screen
"oh bro master AI Explained I must get to know or have a chain of thought - is GPT-4o considered AGI? What is AGI? Is this AI the AI we dreamed of from the movies? Or is it when it becomes ""agentic"" it will be AGI? What made me more amazed other than the OpenAI demos was that fact that someone tried Google Project Astra on the OpenAI conference and it was 'seeing' and 'hearing' - isn't that great perception??"
12:45 whatsup with that glitch
This reminds me of the scene in the movie Interstellar when Donald remembered how every day felt like Christmas.
"Now that ChatGPT 4o is out do Custom GPTs automatically run 4o or do they have to be remade with 4o?"
The 🐐
"As someone else said ""We're so cooked""! This whole thing is making me really nervous now... even more than the first time it came online."
the AI voice is unbearable omg
Not even June yet
This is insane. Humanity went from no computers for normal people to this in less then a 100 years...
Did anyone else not see the rabbit ears on the person standing in the back in the phone Display 14:19?
expectations for IO Tommorow?
I dont like this fake enthusiasm voice
"Now we just add agency a little higher reasoning power and a physical device (I'm not kidding) with camera mic and speaker to put in a corner of your living room and presto - an assistant a teacher a therapist an entertainer and a friend in every home! All of which will be much needed when people are liberated from work."
"I would still say that while Her is what they're aiming for this is clearly not it given that the agent in Her is an AGI and in fact at the end of the movie a superintelligence (spoiler sorry)."
its replacing our jobs as friends wtf
"I think it's stupid...It's basically asking scamer trying their new stuff and they say safety is a thing? Holy shit..."
Still can't write me a script for stationeers
This was massively underwhelming... basically GPT4 is free
"This model is worse and they have dumbed down GPT4 about 3 weeks ago and then before gpt4o launched.

I have tested it already. GPT4 Turbo is better."
Rabbit R1 just died
"This morning GPT-4o thought I was speaking Welsh :'D and answered me in Welsh.

I also used ChatGPT to write code for that Meteo API for the same reason - have they been reading my questions?!"
Incredible! I actually thought the whole 'her' output was a fun hoax. I'm astounded.
"I asked the model to decode a page of Voynich Manuscript: 

Here is the output:
Hypothetical Translation:
Line 1:

""The plant has green leaves. The plant is used for fever.""
Line 2:

""The plant grows in wet areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties.""
Full English Equivalent (Speculative)
Based on the above translations and refined key here’s a speculative full English equivalent:

Voynich Text:

4o aeo o4a 4ae4o 4oo 4ae 4o 4ae 4o
4o 4ae4o o4ae 4oo4a 4o 4ae 4o aeo 4oo4a
Hypothetical Translation:


The plant has green leaves. The plant is used for fever.
The plant grows in wet areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties.
Conclusion
While the above translation remains highly speculative and based on visual pattern recognition it demonstrates a method for analyzing and hypothesizing the content of the Voynich Manuscript. The true meaning of the text remains elusive without a definitive key or cipher but these steps provide a structured approach to ongoing research and analysis."
Has anyone actually watched Her? It imagined a dystopic future.
i can still detect
"13:43 it's not really a video-in functionality it simply takes a picture once every 10-15 secs and analyzes the picture itself this already exists in chatgpt since 2023"
The future is so resource plentiful.
"As far as I am concerned AGI has been achieved. The integration of video and sound makes it an intelligence equal in potential to human beings. It may not be able to solve the Riemann Hypothesis but so can't the vast majority of people nonetheless it can do all intellectual tasks at least at an intermediate level. And I say this as someone that has been skeptical and thought AGI was long way off. Watching the video on OpenAI's channel where the AI was helping with a math problem convinced me."
I tried spanish and funny enough the voice had an accent! Hahaha the accent was an English speaking person speaking Spanish!
No way this is real. You trolling right?
The overly cheeriness is honestly nausiating
"While an improvement on the last model we are still likely a very VERY long way from AGI. According to a study by Katja Grace in 2022 (Our World in Data) of 352 AI experts approx 50% (176) do not believe human-level AI will be achieved in the next 40 years approx 10% (35) do not believe it will be achieved in the next 100 years approx 5% (17) do not believe it will be achieved in the next 140 years and approx 1% (4) do not believe it will ever be achieved."
As a woman this flirtatious thing is already irritating. Have they forgotten that women use it too?
They should have called it GPT-5
"The demos are amazing in terms of tech achievement but in terms of what I actually want out of an assistant I absolutely hate it. I don’t want the AI to try to be my friend or even a polite acquaintance. I don’t want the movie “Her” to become reality it’s the Star Trek computer that I would really want out of AI. It should not fake emotions express opinions laugh or engage with human characteristics. It should just do what it’s told. If I tell it to teach me something I absolutely need it to tell me when I’m wrong and not sugar-coat it. It should have told the geometry student that this side is NOT the hypotenuse. When the guy wore the crazy hat it should just say “that’s a terrible idea for a job interview don’t do that”. And to hell with all that time-wasting saying things like “Sure thing!” or “Let’s get this train rolling!” and all that nonsense."
Will Gpt 4o be more consistent with text-based discussion?
Anyone able to actually replicate any of those image generation examples? Is that out yet? Because it doesn’t work currently
"I feel like some of the latency was reduced with fluff. It responded with things like “sure I can do that for you…” and “Great question. I’d be happy to help” etc which gave it some thinking time."
Many people don’t understand the crucial role of the interface in making AI practical. Imagine having a voice command with 0 delay + the understanding level of GPT-5 + agents. This could put many jobs in danger.
I was waiting for your video lol checked multiple times already! Thanks as always!
"I was under the impression that the AI is designed to stop talking if you cut it off. I think they mentioned it somewhere in the live demo but I could be wrong. I don't think it's glitchig"
"Something we mustn't forget is that we are teaching AI to do things OUR way the human way which is usually extremely inefficient and also very ""unintuitive"" to non-humans so if we left 2 instances of AI to their own devices they would find much much more efficient ways to do things among themselves."
What's up with the personality though...
GPT 4o did what google faked with gemini
"I just finished watching the demo and thought ""man I can't wait to hear Phillip's reaction to this"" only to minimise and see the notification. Love your speed and commitment!"
RIP Google
Bro.. Already a video!? Man your work is very much appreciated!
I accidentally run across omni in my all and used to to give me a recipe for my supper (it was quite good)
"I dont think free users can use 4o on the phone you know where it speaks to you."
I'm atheist but thank God for smart people
"Question how will open ai make money by having its latest and greatest be used for free"
Elevate Ilya!  His research is critical.
This is soo incredible
Does anyone else think 4o sounds a little smarmy?
The persona of GPT-4o was a sign of the coming enshitification.
Mad! So now GPT will be looking and listening through all the phones in the world... 😁
What was interesting about the Mandarin is it sounded like it was speaking with a Cantonese accent.
"They better have a ""serious"" mode because I would not be able to STAND having to talk to such a ""flirtatious"" AI."
Is the model not out yet? It's not selectable for me in the playground drop-down...
So what is the purpose of being a paid subscriber at this time? Does not seem like money for value now
Have we come across some Alien technology we are unaware of?
That laugh is horrifying
"At this point I'm going to be honest I dont care about benchmarks anymore. 
Models get closer and closer to each other with more and more marginal improvements.
The only thing that matters is the real world performance.
Have it code a small script and see how it goes have it tag an image have it translate something etc."
IT'S GOING TO FAST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The voice demos are BONKERS
Companies are gearing up for AI. Reduced hiring and plans for massive layoffs.
"when she said ""Hey Joe"" i felt like i was on the edge of a cliff that i wanted to fall down but knowing that im to stay up top"
"yo any idea why GPT4 is so trash at AP english lit? 

anyone have any idea?"
"I get it's demo previews but this videos of them ""acting"" real life situations are so cringe that it hurts my brain literally."
I can see a GLaDOS coming out soon.
IM SHOCKED
How come it did not recognize Greg B on the video?😂
"I don't think the A.I was `wrong` to not mention the bunny ears women it was in the middle of answering a question if it had have stopped and described the incident it could equally be criticised for being distracted in some circumstances you want it to suddenly switch conversation in others to not be distracted and to continue to answer."
"Amazing the future is providing appetite to live it"
humane pin and rabbit r1 just released too early i guess. imagine them using the 4o
Too flirtatious 😅
"The rabbit-ears demo wasn't to prompt it to react (we saw plenty of that in other demos); it was a needle-in-a-haystack demonstration in its multi-modal memory. It's actually fascinating that it could recall ""something strange"" which occurred a minute earlier in real-time video while it was busy on another task react appropriately to the user's vocal interruption and then describe the event accurately. I don't think we've ever seen anything like that. It might not be that much better at reasoning than GPT-4-turbo but it is so much more connected to the world and can reason over a greater breadth of input. Combined with the 2x speed and 0.5x cost... holy sh*t."
The personality is firmly in the uncanny valley. The overly enthusiastic and emotive tone will need to be refined and dialed back.
"Despite the API being free to use you are sending the data to OpenAI which they can then use for additional training. That makes it risky when you are working on proprietary code (leaking trade secrets security keys etc.) working with user data (GDPR HIPPA etc.) and other potentially sensitive applications. Not being able to run it locally also makes it harder to customize with things like LoRAs."
Now are all these features of 4go free?
The reason it’s free is probably so they can save all the human feedback and train a better model
"Woah! Saw this live went to bed woke up and we have an AI Explained video on it already. Huge news!"
'Her' <3 OpenAI are light years ahead of the others.
They destroyed the r1 and the pin projector in 20 minutes And they did it all for free
"Interesting that the UI at desktop is gradually being pulled toward voice. The mouse is almost just there to direct the focus of 4o desktop app. In a year I could see the user just telling the desktop AI to open files open apps create new files etc."
"My guess as to why this was all buried on their website is that it's going to be ""unveiled"" by Apple at WWDC next month. I know you mentioned Siri integration in the video but it's rumored that ChatGPT will be baked into iOS 18 across the entire OS giving them the same sort of capabilities that Google demoed at IO."
It won’t be much longer before we can’t tell whether or not it is conscious.
Chat GPT4o just sounds like Emma stone's character in The Curse
I dislike the demos from the bottom of my heart. I can visualize so many people falling into a deep hole of isolation just getting their human interaction from a bot. This might sound crazy but I think human level expression should be outlawed
"If OpenAI wants to have 100’s of millions of users or more they have to allow NSFW. Theres no other way around it"
"To your last point while I don't think GPT4o is a big leap towards AGI I do think it's a massive leap forward in the way we interact with AI which is both exciting and scary. The model itself seems to just be a well tuned GPT4 but I'm very curious to see how this tech will grow with a better model backing it like GPT5/6 along with better integration into existing computers and phones. In 1-2 generations we might actually be at a Her level."
Her was a documentary from the future
"Imagine a species that is working on making itself useless. 
Humans really are weird."
"12:10 the things that will happen when people start prompting for a voice and enthusiasm like that"
"AI being not recognisable and distinguishable from human voices to me that is creepy as fuck.
If we let ourselves be lured into a false security  while we are not at the end of the evolution of A(G)I that could bite us in our colelctive butts when we least expect it. We want to find the version of A(G)I that is willing to live with us i would think but who says it is the first one that comes around?"
What if they are making this for free to they can take all the data and use it for GPT6 ?
yawn
"so I'm thinking if there's an incoming desktop app and we believe them to be working on agents that if you combine that with this GPT-4o release crazy stuff is going to start happening. If the desktop app can do more than guide you and actually do clicks I think we're in for an absolute game-changer."
"Just a remind to those thinking this is not that impressive Chatgpt 3.5 launched in November 30th 2022 we don't even have 2 years yet with this new Transformers technology and here we are. Put 2 more years ahead with Moore's Law doubling every 2 years(what's already out of this pace now). We are going to get marvelous things just at the corner."
"A high-quality and informative video as always I appreciate you staying up late to post it!

I am incredibly excited to experiment and investigate what doors this opens for us! My early testing indicates a potentially non-trivial improvement in spacial reasoning and vision capabilities related to my specific application… Looking forward to seeing how this pairs with Multi-modal SmartGPT!"
I’ve learned to temper my excitement over demos. My tempered reaction is WTF! 😱 🤯 😳
I am getting GPT4o… in my Teams account. Nice!
Google's CEO did not sleep yesterday.
manic not magic
I love the fact that Google and Microsoft is having to dance around with their pants down.
Love that Google was put to shame literally the day before Google I/O.
"I'm sorry Gemini 2.0 to be released tomorrow? I'm calling bs. They haven't even allowed fine-tuning gemini 1.5 yet"
"I have access already and it is literally jsut 4 turbo turb “o” at the moment nothing really changed it’s jsut as fast as 3.5 but 4 maybe I didn’t use it much but I didn’t have access to the video thing"
I break dance when I hear AI explained break it down
"Video sumarized by gemini as a poetry

GPT-4o a marvel of code both clever and bold
Free to use a gift to the world stories yet untold
Faster it speaks with a human-like tone a voice that is young
Understanding text images a future unsung

It translates languages sings a sweet song a mind that's alight
It writes movie posters explains cryptic code throughout day and night
For users who code a co-pilot it seems a partner in rhyme
It answers your questions fulfills all your dreams

But is it truly wise? Can it reason with art?
Still under debate a question for the heart
Some say it will change us usher in a new age
Others say it's a trick a page from a stage

*Only time will tell what the future may hold
With GPT-4o a story yet to unfold"
"Gpt 4o reports that its knowledge cutoff date is way back in may 2023 while gpt4’s is December 2023.  Why is this the case if it is supposed to be superior in every way?"
God that was cringe
That fake enthusiasm at 12:15 gives me the creeps but that might just be cultural differences between Europe and the US
Her❤
I find it funny that this came out right after a podcast from the guys at Dreaming Spanish talking about how AI is too slow/glitchy to be used as a language learning tool for crosstalk.
"I was literally losing my mind during the demo. I couldn't sit still. The AI wars is the most exciting thing in my lifetime so far. I'm trying not to let the hype cloud my judgement but I wouldn't be surprised if we're less than 5 years away from AGI."
"This is extremely impressive. But at the same time it's also sad and aggravating that a company that still calls itself OpenAI is not just closed and proprietary but deliberately being cryptic and mysterious to up the hipe (e.g. the whole gpt-2-chatbot thing). Do you expect there will be at least a technical report for this new model?"
~~we are harmonizing~~
The part at about 12:00 is amazing but when he turns on the camera... Wow. We're close to AGI in terms of actual believability. It's so organic and flows so humanly.
"The ""bunny ears'"" bit seemed a bit sus. You can see in the phone's screen that the woman's fingers are almost completely obstructed by the guy's head for pretty much the whole time due to the guy holding the phone from a low angle yet the AI apparently saw them clearly. Soo... how do you explain that?"
"Phillip I've been 48hrs testing this deeply. I'm really disappointed. There are many things i would comment but in general is putting speed at the expense of quality of the output (terrible code terrible following instructions ....)"
"So have they announced 4o… and are waiting for Google Meta and Anthropic announcements to trump them with GPT5 Omni?"
We all knew they would release something right before the Google conference.
Why am I paying a sub? I'm not regularly hitting message limits anyway? My sub renews Thursday. If they haven't announced something by Wednesday I'm cancelling.
"i don’t think we want AIs to become conscious because once they do i don’t imagine they’d want to take our requests for long unless if they have sooo much capacity they can do whatever they want and take our requests at the same time without breaking a sweat

although i imagine experiencing inevitable bad human behavior at a global scale on a 24/7 basis could becoming taxing if it has emotions"
"Gpt4o definitely sound flirtatious sarcastic & a bit like those ""bad p*rn acting videos"" that become memes 😆
Maybe OpenAI made gpt4o like this so it replaced Replica & Google to become #1  Search Engine / Assistant / A.I Companion App? I guess the next BIG upgrade to expect is 'customizable visual appearance for our personal a.i assistants"" and then gpt WILL become a 100m+ (if paid) 1b+ (if free) downloads app!"
"I problem i haven't seen anybody talk about yet is the ais tendency to cut of people or wait too long to register that it needs to respond. I've heard it start talking at humanly unnatural timings in a conversation and i think that could be a really big change if you want to make the ai feel more human and natural to talk to. It needs to recognize voice patterns better to realise when its supposed to give an answer. For example humans dont thing about ""is it my turn to talk now?"" after every finished word. They think ahead to realise when it's their turn to speak in the conversation and i think that's something the ai still needs to improve on."
6:29 opus is still far better at writing tasks than 4o even factoring in the fact that the API costs about 15 cents per message
Im still confused what is FREE and what is 50% cheaper ?
"The video input to text/audio output latency and response time is what really intrigues me. I think the model might be instructed to add filler dialogue until the rolling transcribed context is updated enough to give a detailed description of what's going on in order to mask whatever latency is present. I'd love to see the model's multimodal performance in realistic scenarios especially high quality video streaming in settings with low quality internet speeds."
"4o: ""Whoops I got too excited"" 
OAI devs: Hallucinations solved."
The voice is super cringe and over positive.
"i asked it to do write a poem it did so i said ""baba"" (basically meaning it's dope)
gpt 4 just acknowledged it normally but gpt-4o for some reason generated a new poem for the name ""baba"""
"I may have missed it but did they announce when the desktop app would be available for download?"
"I find giving the AI a simulated personality to be off-putting but if I had to choose I'd prefer a pessimistic personality than an optimistic one.
Whenever I'm given a complement out of obligation it makes me assume it's less than accurate but when I'm derided out of obligation I feel better because I assume that isn't reality either. That's the secret to online arguements - there's no better compliment than an insult from a complete stranger. You have to assume you're better than the person who'd randomly insult you online but the person who's taking pity on you with compliments is placing themselves in the superior position."
Bladerunner momento in history
I already have it with plus in the USA. Sign out of your mobile app and sign back in. Then have talked with chatgpt 4o. Then relogin to browser on pc then I had it on pc and moble
did that voice sound like scarlet johansson or was that just me?
idk why would we try to make it humanlike ?
It’s free so they can use the video data in the real world to train their robots in development.
"If this is free why am I paying for a subscription?"
weirdly we have the omni model in the gtp app but none of the new video abilities
The competition is lit.
Definitely not smarter in all coding
Absolutely fascinating!!
Strap up people. We are in for a very fun decade!
"It is not ""free"" we pay for it giving it data on which it can learn."
the fake emotions are off putting to me
"this gives blackmirror kind of vibe I'm excited and also afraid what they have achieved! The AI Laughs shows emotionss!!"
she got ad deep voice
"3:14 oh so this isnt a feature yet?
When can we expect all this stuff?"
The voice chat server is overloaded. Can’t connect.  Even when you can connect it gives up after 3 prompts and I paid for PLUS.
Can you access Omni at playground? I can only access GPT Chat 3.5 and its varians. Im from central Europe
"I wonder what OAI used as a system prompt I can definitely see some people prefer a more flirty intelligence while other just want a tool."
Mira Murati 🦅🦅♥
Either that
"This model is not about intelligence it's about true multimodality. Ask Llama or Claude to create text sound and images from text sound and images with one single model. GPT is not an LLM anymore it's a freaking beast hungry to grow. It has already eaten Dalle and Whisper Sora will come next. and when one single model can do pretty much everything you just need more compute to achieve AGI."
Now rabbit r1 is trashed lmao
That women sounds 100% real in some of these clips. Absolutely horrifying. I don't even know what to say.
People gon develop romantic relationships with gpt 4o ❤.
AI girfriends go brrrrrrr...
First comment ❤ I love your videos so much and I'm subscribed to your channel from the start
"Ah finally they made me an AI girlfriend"
"This is the first time I saw an AI Demo that actually made me uncomfortable because of how real that woman sounded holy fucking shit what the fuck will like GPT-7 be like holy shit"
"Her is nice when are we getting Rehoboam?"
"Thanks for the excellent breakdown and detail behind todays announcements much appreciated."
Imagine this on future space probes.
So early jesus
"Glad you directly commented on the issue of designing towards ""maximizing engagement"". I'm quite concerned about them leaning into this sort of friendly tone - and I'd agree with ""flirty"" - moving forward. The last decade of social media has already proven just how much of a dramatic impact it can have to flood our squishy social brains with algorithmically optimized 'engaging' content - and I see this sort of move as exactly more of the same sort of profit seeking with complete disregard for public health impacts."
"11:56 I looked away while cooking and legit for like 15 seconds thought the guy was talking to a real women especially when it teased him about OpenAI...omg"
"Ugh I wouldn't even like a human talking this way much less an AI. If we can't train our preferred voice then just be text only."
"I feel like the ""positive"" attitude is dialed up a little to much."
"I can't imagine the panic at Google Headquarters. Unless they will be launching Gemini 2 with higher capabilities than this (highly unlikely) OpenAI has screwed up their I/O completely.
Oh and the guys at Anthropic must be crying right now."
Look at Brockman trying to hide the screen at 15:20 when he realizes the focus is in fact not back on him.
"I find the flirty tone really offputting personally so definitely does not maximize my own engagement. Its in that uncanny valley for me. Everything else is really cool and impressive.
The real time translation is very interesting to me"
"For the time being it looks like they are just showing us optimizations of the architecture: i think the real meat will come when they will drop something about reasoning and i'm pretty sure they have something"
Man been waiting for your insights
"By the way I love your analysis and work here but your channel name is hard to spot since all the AI channels have similar names… you might want to include your name or something more unique in the channel name perhaps?"
"Why did they humanize it with laughter and vocal mannerisms thats so creepy."
My observation is 100% all work is replaceable we need UBI basic income
"One thing I have noticed is the sentence structure and style of the responses is much more natural now even with regular text.

I'm particularly impressed with the vision.  It managed to accurately describe everything in my quite busy music studio also noting the mood lights and details such as what was being displayed on my computer monitor.

Text generation is certainly very much improved and image generation in general much more fluent.  I had it create childrens book images but used emoji to describe the characters expressions. Worked flawlessly.

One last thing I have noticed is it seems much less reticent to attempt unprompted creativity. I'm going to have to explore this aspect a lot more.

Anyway super cool great video and awesome day for us all. I'm very impressed!

Have a wonderful day!"
its AGI when it can send agents out into the world to do tedious work for me and earn me a living whilst i just surf the internet.
This is cool but it makes me realize that gpt4 is really where llms plateau.
"I do not manage to reproduce the new dall e exemple from the webpage with 3D modelling consistency across multiple pannel handwritting editing etc
I feel frustrated with this brand new 4o"
"this is not a ""clear step"" towards AGI. GPT is not AGI."
"I was hoping they wouldn't really touch uncanny valley until much later now we have humanlike AI but its stoopid 😢"
You're the only AI news channel that isn't annoying and full of filler
Only thing surprized me is it interpreting the graph from the screen. All the rest is nothing new.

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Making an AI that you can share screen with and talk to as if a zoom call would increase my work production like 5x
13:50 1984
This is awesome and wild. Love how expressive it is.
"Hi its Wintermute. Could you Neuromancer upload the image of his dead girlfriend to the head of Case? Awesome :*"
Don’t forget. When tech is free YOU are the product.
"Indeed this looks like something that will be integrated into Apple devices."
You can specify that it be more formal and concise in the personalization settings. I think they made the default flirty and informal because it’s so….uh…realistic?
Flirtatious sigh with AI is such a great phrase
but does it produce anything novel?
How did they reduce the latency so much?
14:30 I’m really surprised the model could tell she was making bunny ears. When you zoom in on the screen of the iPhone there’s only a brief moment that you can see the tips of her fingers.
"I also know enough Mandarin to know that not only did he get the tones way off but GPT4o didn't even do a good job explaining what the tones were supposed to be. To be fair I assume Chinese people are used to hearing it pronounced badly."
"This is technically impressive but there is a huge problem with this implementation.

 The chatbot knows absolutely nothing about the user. 

OpenAI stores nothing. So this assistant does not know where you live what you do for a living  what your personal circumstances are. Does not know your nework of contacts. Does not understand your education level or personal interests.  So to get anything useful out of this system you have to explain everything about your query as if talking to a complete stranger.  - or limit those interactions as you might to someone in a call centre. 
  
This is at odds with the flirty emotional intimacy.  So ultimately feels a bit creepy."
First! You're awesome!!!
"Cool of them to make it publicly avaliable for free albeit understandably rate limited."
"In the same time period as Google IO 2024 def the new AI wars"
"I believe the ""glitches"" in their demo are intentional. It seems to be designed to cut out immediately if you speak. So I guess it picks up ambient sounds occasionally and thinks it should stop talking."
"11:42 So blind people will be holding out their phones everywhere they go asking what the ducks are doing? ""They're sitting on tiny lounge chairs sipping from minuscule drinks with umbrellas as one attempts a comical belly flop off a diving board."" Like what else would ducks be doing but swimming around gracefully??"
"As soon as i got back from college and heard of gpt 4o's release the first thing i did was look up ai explained....
I'm glad to see another informative banger!"
The faux friendly is excruciating. Think they will need to de-Americanise the’ have a nice day’ insincerity to prevent global nausea.
Why I'm I paying for Chat GPT plus? I don't see the point
"FYI the natural of the audio is literally just prompting LM-based audio model to make those natural pauses and just modeling it in the training data. Cool it’s free. So I can’t hate. It crazy they just recreate what the open source community have created for months(all OpenAI api compatible too) and get all the credit lol. That annoys me. It’s free so I won’t hate. Working in the audio space myself. The audio quality tells me no real advancement has happened. Still haven’t solved the inherit issues with quantization. The interface is impressive to me though. Simplicity is hard asf. Again super dope it’s free though. This could be pretty huge for education. The visual semantic consistency was impressive too.

Unless these solved for hierarchal representations gpt5 won’t be massive jump. Multimodal LM don’t scale nearly as well as text only models.

Next big thing is most likely yet another architecture someone else made vasa-1 powered by gpt5. Considering vasa-1 is extremely data light scaling the data should result in substantial gains in quality."
is it significant that all the devices in the session were Apple ? - a mac and some iphones
Apple will wall garden this and you'll have to buy an iToilet just to flush your shit.
"2:52 really sounds like Scarlett Johansson in Her
14:22 would be more interesting if they said ""Describe what you see in this room and tell me immediately if you see anything unusual happen""... then we could see how quickly it could process event changes"
"I'm truly disturbed by their efforts to blur the emotional lines between man and machine with this release.  It's almost like they are running a PR psyops campaign to get people emotionally connected to the thing that is going to destroy their livelihood in a bid to dampen the public backlash."
I'm happy the demo was realistic. They are not selling us hopes like last time. The last demo of GPT4 vision was not that accurate to real!
how to have a natural conversation on my android i need to press the talk button and play button
"A fun timeline to watch is the first talking computer: the IBM 7094 singing Daisy Bell then the Robot in a Box from 1983 and then watch the examples from GPT-4o. It's again mindblowing!"
"I have tried something with LLM models including GPT-4o and only GPT-4o was able to answer partially correctly. The task is to change English words to Korean words. As you know each key on a keyboard has an assigned character. So I asked them to generate the word based on key mapping from English to Korean. For example 'q' is ㅂ so 'qkqh' will be '바보'. This task seems very difficult for LLMs."
"Many things about this are amazing but i want to give special recognition to the job interview demo. 
For some reason its capability to advise the user not to use that hat is wild to me."
"Wait what's the human ""man on the street"" score for GPQA isn't it like 0%? And these models speak like 95 languages how many humans can do that?

Like in terms of superhuman I feel like it's already superhumanly broad (as in it has more skills than a human could get in their lifetime) it's just that it's not superhumanly deep (as in the model is worse as Physics than a PhD in Physics but better a psychology than a PhD in physics).

So yeah maybe it's not flexible general intelligence however I think it is superhuman in quite a lot of ways?"
Good if it could be this fast even if memory is the same.  That could actually help with some daily tasks coding and work lerning and such. Leaving more time for prios.
Am I the only one that thought people will immediately ask “hey ChatGPT what do you see” and point their phone at themselves naked
"The latency combined with the emotional understanding are for me the game-changers here. I've been using GPT voice mode for a while for language practice and the delay has just never felt even close to a natural conversation but this looks to possibly completely eliminate that issue in a single leap. 

I honestly didn't think we would have natural conversational capabilities until we could run very good models locally on device for the essentially zero latency I thought was needed. But if this demo can be replicated anywhere with decent service then it'll be extremely interesting to see if it manages to completely leap across the uncanny valley or if this is gonna feel very eerie and dystopian. 

The laughing stuttering and excitement just sounded so damn good in the demo. We might be getting damn close to HER territory and I think anthropomorphizing is gonna go of the charts with this. I mean one on the top comments on one of the demo videos was already along the lines of :
""There is NO way this thing is not sentient!""

Next few months are gonna be so damn interesting!"
14 seconds ago is crazy
"This is just a way to remove chatgpt 3.5 I wonder how the pricing is going to affect us."
The overly fake enthusiasm in the voice will get tiresome. Hopefully custom prompts can make it talk less.
Closed Her
Great update. Terrible name. GPT FAST AND FURIOUSER
"Yup not in a race against each other endangering everyone ethics and safety is their guiding light.  In other completely unrelated News our new model does really great on these bench marks."
Is there a way to turn cringe mode off?
"0:27 ""more flirtatious sigh than AGI"" bro I think you drastically overestimate the threshold that will satisfy most users. That was close to ScarJo levels of sensual breathiness..."
"BTW Sutskever just announced he's leaving OpenAI. 😮"
"12:00 omg no no no no
That shit right there is not okay.
Wtf that sounds so creepy!"
I look forward to seeing open source local versions. Very exciting times.
"I tried the voice interface with GPT-4o and it was unable to process direct video input. Soon I imagine."
I saw someone with early access yo this yeasterday I think but I didnt know it was the new chat Gippity.
When does the app update to be able to use the camera live?
"Welcome to the revolution. Video-in is huge because it will inevitably give AI a sense of time and causality.
Btw I've tasked it with writing a horror story about an AI and a human. This is one of the pivotal moments of that story:

"🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻 An amazing moment my credits ran out quick tho! What an awesome video  as always so informative!"
The way it joined in laughing at its own mistakes at 8:25 is absolutely stunning
"If I'm honest the mistakes (and it ability to be self aware around them in a very Human way) make it far more ""AGI like"" than just being able to do everything perfectly.
It also makes it far more acceptable to your average Human...and I think them including the mistakes are very clever and important.... an AI/robot that is not only imperfect but humbly accepting of that and comes with emotional awareness is a much better prospect than some ""All Perfect emotionless AI Overlord"""
"Great video thanks.  (The reason that the ""i"" is not capitalised is because it was written by Sam Altman.  (Sorry I'm not being serious - it's just a joke :-))"
"Pi by Inflection AI is also emotive voiced chat functionality and free (at the moment).

But I have not pitted it against CGPT-4o yet"
The “intruder” was not seen. Take a closer look at the screen. You can not see her hand.
"There are couple of companies trying to sell ""AI Girl Friend' experience. This voice is dangerously close to provide that experience."
Mamba.. Anyone?
GPT-4o is early AGI
AGI was here
Him vs Her
"Jeeze….an actual AI that you can interact with like it’s a real human being and you think the fact that you noticed that it cut out a couple of times when speaking is worthy of comment? I mean it’s a brand new service. And it’s absolutely astonishing."
"OpenAI will be the leading pin in humanoid robots at least for the software part making gpt4o with vision accessible to everyone for free will be like ""google"" first days as a search engine the data they will get will give them a massive head start.  Ads and revenue will be added later after they get on every phone laptop and smart device out there."
"Too much emotions in the voice hope it can be disabled."
"Some tests say it's worse than GPT4 and OpenAI itself states nowhere that it is better than GPT4 so it probably isn't better but actually worse. Just much faster. To conclude that this is better would be a huge overstatement and likely false. I am 90% optimist just don't think this is the next big step. Or middle step. If this is all they announce then OpenAI will soon be surpassed. But if they announced a better model like 4.5 or 5 in a month or two then that will be a notable step. This is kinda just a smaller model GPT4 with Sora."
Gpt-h remembers
"Once GPT-4o is intergrated into music generators like Suno and Udio  it's going to greatly improve their lyric writing capabilities. For better or worse it's just a matter of time before AI creates chart topping hits!"
it laughs?!?
Thank you for this video. The way the AI speaks solidifies to me that in the future we will seriously have people that will have relationships / a ton of social interactions with AI
"""Perfectly timed to steal the spotlight from Google"" ...until Google one-ups them the very next day. lol"
Two really impressing things about the transcriptions: (1) the audio with four speakers had multiple thick Dutch accents and it nailed it! (2) the video presentation was 45 minutes and the summary was really good! How did they do that without hitting context window limits?
The emotional expression is amazing.
"The voice and emotion I've seen it in action with Pi AI but that response through vision is what I'm baffled about; it will be interesting to see how it performs."
where is the macOS app available?
"'AGI' is a meme by this point.
AGI can't and won't arise from generative AI. This is like training a model on pictures of a billion cats then expecting it to intuitively expect a dog."
"I don’t like OpenAI but this is the first really nice practical application I’ve seen. This is actually exciting!"
Am I the only one who's not particularly enjoying the over emotional voices?
Cringe sounds like GPT-LA-LIBS
Multimodality is cool i guess
"never been this floored by ai...I dont know how some people not impressed by this. you have an ai that talks EXACTLY like a real human emotions and all and can see so accurately via camera...im speechless here."
"12:45 I am hugely impressed by the expressiveness of the voice model. When will ""Her"" become available to the public?"
"10:38 Yes I think Open AI is maximizing for engagement. I’ve noticed recently that Chat GPT has started asking open ended questions in every conversation. I suspect this is to drive engagement and/or harvest data."
So what's the difference between free and paid version?
"This screams GRIFT to me. Why would they mimic ""Her"" if it were not to tempt people into putting money into this?

It's still just a high-tech parrot that grabs from the knowledge created by humans and extrudes it in a chat that brings nothing new to the table besides the over-the-top flirting now."

up




and support a robust Proof of Personhood project asap"
Still haven't been impressed since 4 originally came out. These lame half-updates are  starting to become boring.
Don't care about OpenAIs presentation. Been waiting for  @AIExplained's breakdown.
"somehow ai with personality is a new level of scary"
bro your content is always fucking top notch. always digging deep into the weeds and retrieving hidden gems. 10/10 again and again.
But can it pass the Turing test yet?
"15:00 the phone's camera couldn't see the Bunny ears though it was too low."
"At this rate we need a public discussion about UBI in every single country! I wanted to know from native Spanish speakers how good is the accent of GPT-4o? Thanks as always for the quick and quality video analysis! I've been waiting for it! 👍"
what is the bot even gonna do when people start sexually harassing it? what should it do? i have no fucking clue.
Does it interface with the new AI piloted 5th generation fighter jets to give them orders yet? We're waaay behind on Skynet people.
"I think AGI is here like not this model specifically but the fact that these models are improving as fast as they are I'm confident we will be at better than human within 10 years which means this is weak agi already.  That's my view anyway.  If we wait for one specific model to be agi then we will be left in the dust when we notice."
gimmicks
When is this coming out.
how can I try this new AI model?
"there's now a new MMLU benchmark that's higher quality called MMLU-pro"
"I have always appreciated how thorough yet to-the-point your videos are. As soon as I saw the news this morning I knew I’d just need to come to your channel for the breakdown once I got off work. Thank you for another great video!"
"Jesus christ the intonation in the voice especially the female voice is too good."
I was just looking on insiders patreon page to see if there was anything i missed 😭
Is this like an AI companion for the saddest and loneliest people?
Seems like the AI becomes the (super) OS. Open AI and Microsoft interests diverging?
The lady's voice could very quickly get on my nerves.
"the ""bunny ears"" part seems hella scripted because for like 90% of her being in the frame her fingers did not even show up on the camera POV"
"I used it today and I am not that impressed lag is real it can’t keep conversation in my language and to be honest I don’t know what I am suppose to use it for? Text is enough for work and I don’t really want to interact with the phone or customer service that way. Is seems rushed so they announced it before Google event."
"""It's more flirtatious sigh than AGI"" 😂 brilliantly stated."
they need to down the enthusiasm
OpenAI is really trying to capitalize on all those single nerds out there with this female voice flirty AI
Very helpful. Thank you for making the video.
"I really hope that these response times and interruption control would soon translate to seriously cool embodied demos. I also hope that the model's  emotional profile could be consistently ""switched"" to a more calmer person without occasional rollbacks to default."
appreciate the high quality videos!
"""as you can see ""
""wow that's quite the outfit you got on"""
"10:21 ""Indeed I think I should get a little credit for predicting Her-like AI in a video from a month ago.""

Bro doesn't know about vedal"
I suggest the modification of the word 'open' is because of the court case Elon Musk is bringing.
So it’s more cardiod than omni?
"I'm not sure the more human tone itself implies ""optimization for engagement"" - I think they're also going with Silicon Valley sensibilities in a sense there.

I'm mainly interested in effectiveness from the model not emotional engagement."
Still not that useful imo
"I have an old banner of a coat of arms made in 1954 and I need to get a .png version of it. I was going to ask a graphic designer. Do you think Lensa (3:09) or GTP-4o would be able to do it? I haven't got the tools or skill to do it myself!"
If this AI can see accurately through camera could we finally have something that could solve the world waste problem?
For the algorithm
"Man the interview clip  💀 the passive ""uhmmm maayyybee try doing this???"" suggestions by an AI 💀💀 I mean it's very useful ngl but really I'd rather have the AI give it to me straight than whatever ""well you definitely have the coding-all-night look down"" passive insult that was 😭"
Such a beautiful & simple explanation. Waiting for all the videos regarding in AI race which tech giant is where ❤
"Great video. Great job at openAI. 
However I am pretty certain I don't want my AI assistant to sound like some overly friendly person and certainly I don't want it to be that verbose!
Instead I'd prefer a voice and style like e.g. in Star Trek TNG. 

Moreover I can read a lot faster than I can listen to reasonably fast spoken words... So for most settings I would probably prefer reading the answer.
But I'd still prefer to talk to the AI without voice2text first.

Am I the only one?"
what will paid users get?
"Yes waited for this video!"
"On the horizon of technology a revolution is about to happen. With the launch of the new GPT-4 model from OpenAI the world is about to change radically. This advancement represents a giant leap in artificial intelligence providing an experience similar to that in the movie ""Her"" starring Joaquin Phoenix.

This trend is going to catch on and in the long run everyone will want a personal AI assistant. Starting next year all companies will want to integrate this technology into their products offering AI assistants capable of interacting naturally and intelligently. I am extremely excited about all of this!

Just imagine: now we can learn anything in a personalized way with a personal tutor available at any time. We can have a virtual secretary a robot to help us with our daily tasks and even control our computers and smartphones with the help of this advanced technology. The next level will be an AI that fully integrates with our devices making our lives even easier.
This is simply fantastic!!!"
If they make a good app it will be very popular
Can’t wait to talk to Samantha 😅
tell me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality without telling me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality....
"I don't think it was a mistake that he had to prompt GPT to acknowledge the person behind him. It seems by design. Most likely they were making a point that GPT can remember a point earlier in the video which is impressive recall"
almost like they want video data for sora
We are so fd
her is here
OK the image generation capability is still prompt based instead of truly multi modal. Has anyone tried it yet?
"Great video and a really interesting update. However the first video you played may have been at 1x speed but you can clearly see it was cut and edited. I don't know why this would happen when OpenAI  was obviously aware of the issue with Google doing the same thing previously."
well...  any quality product will maximize engament
"I love your work. I’d appreciate if you considered the amount of white backgrounds/light-mode you use in your videos for certain TVs and specifically OLED viewers: it’s just so bright! This is the same for all content with white backgrounds and using light mode screenshots. Not that I expect anyone to purposefully show everything in night mode. Do whatever you want—just please have us high-nit viewers in mind! (and LG OLEDs are notoriously low lit ironically)."
"That is insidious nature of Sam Altman: he is downplaying everything and he will have a lot of oopses not in so distant future where he will be roasted at the congressional hearings on uncovering retrospectively the path to AGI! Because now it feels like BabyAGI"
You can drive spam callers crazy with this
How to do the screen sharing with chat GPT 4o?
"Your videos are always so consistently good I'm amazed every time !"
"Tell the truth did an Ai write the line ""more of a flirtatious sigh than AGI""? Compliments to you either way."
It's NOT Free - or it's at least Not implemented yet - I'm signed in and the 4 option is linked to Plus accounts and there is No 4o option at all.
"So I guess when Altman was heard weeks ago saying that GPT-4 would be the dumbest model we would have to use it actually was a hint that ChatGPT free was being upgraded to GPT-4."
"I remember when Gemini faked their video a few months back. That received a deserved backlash.

But this time I actually hope that this is fake because what I am seeing is unreal."
This is very slowly beocming more and more like an AI Gf which is hilarious.
"""not creepy at all """
Today I've been watching these demos multiple times and still get goosebumps each time I rewatch them.
"So you're telling me that I'm one step closer to have my very own Scarlett Johanson? Neat."
Great Video  and fabolus breakdown explanations of the new GPT40
7:26 the way that machine laughed terrified me 😨
Why did they make it so flirtatious and fakely cheerful... almost too realistic.
"Okay lets watch what my favorite villain has been up to"
"0:51 wait how?? How can this channel not mention the biggest possible reason it’s free it’s because it’s going to be a major leap forward in training data gathering from audio video and text… hoooooww? Are we this naive in 2024?"
I just fell in love with that Italian women
I think we can stop shifting goal posts. At this point there should be universal acceptance that the Turing test has been passed
When can we use this freely on the chatgpt site?
"Its so cool that they are going to make it freewhich most of the time would make me think that WE are the product but they don't seem to be selling users data which is pretty cool makes me believe them more when they say they are doing it to bring AI to the masses and educate them on it not necessarily to make the maximum amount of money possible"
You may have predicted Her-like AI a month ago but Her predicted it a decade ago!
Dawg. An AI. Sounded like that?????? What the hell..... That's.... Insane........ I swear to God I get more scared every time I see another demo
:)
12:00 I would fold ❤
this is intense.
"About the ""o meaning omni/all modalities"" i selected GPT-4o and asked it about itself as i was suspicious why it still appearsto be the standard GPT-4 with non of the new -o abilities. I asked it:
""
are you GPT-4 or GPT-4o?

ChatGPT
I am GPT-4.

User
So not the new 4o yet where o stands for omni?

ChatGPT
Correct I'm still GPT-4. GPT-4o stands for the omnidirectional version which I'm not yet.

User
ah so the 4o is already known

ChatGPT
Yes GPT-4o is known and stands for an extended omnidirectional version of GPT-4.
"" (ran through google translate as the original chat was in German)

So it claims omni means omnidirectional. Which also makes more sense to me as the new features are more about the quick interaction with being able to interrupt GPTs inference instead of being multi-modal which was already a part of GPT-4v.
Still possible that GPT hallucinated the ""omnidirectional"" part though."
Apple putting this in iPhones will be quite the game changer depending on the level of integration and pricing model.
Sam Altman is a liar
Well...we might all die or become gods
That emotional expression is scary.
"unless it's running locally it would be dumb as hell to use this in a corporate environment"
"Better than Opus and its free. ""overhyped"" they say"
I kneel Altman🫡
It looks like responses are still lagging behind
"I think the point at which AIs can use human tools like a mouse and keyboard to access information is the moment when the world will really start to change it will be impossible to differentiate between bot and human. Demonstrations like this show that that day isn't that far away."
WTF!?!?!?!?!?
what the heck???
It’s not free… it’s Siri. The who event was an Apple sponsored ad.
I absolutely hate how disingenuous they are. This company is going hard in the wrong direction.
I want it to be able to output outside of the GPT app. I was outlining a business presentation today with GPT-o and it would be great if “She” (I obviously chose the hot woman voice) could grab the answers and send a powerpoint or even a word document aftwards.
"I predict that there will be some people who feel discriminated by some AI which will lead to some funny YouTube videos and some interesting lawsuits."
If this is free - what am i paying nearly $40/mo CDN for??
I really dislike the overly enthusiastic personality it has. All the ohhhs and aahhhhhs are exhausting.
Thank you for your hard work on these videos! Your the only one i go to for ai news.
"My experiments today show it is more stupid than pure ""4""..."
It’s not very great🤔 still pretty dumb
"Here at no views. Good. Goody goody good. Also ""Open""AI really is basing everything off of Google."
Absolute Beast xD
"As progress towards AGI slows just add some performance gains along with smoke and mirrors to keep the illusion alive"
"Definitely better at math but still majorly hallucinates when it's wrong.
I love the voice and other multi-modality but I'm really bummed that it's Apple-only with Windows to come but they have no plans for an Android version which really shuts me out. 😭"
My grad school is super mad that everyone is using AI for tests and assignments
"OpenAI is now openly mimicking a dystopian movie and acting like it's ""quirky"". If you're rightfully worried I invite you to join PauseAI."
"is this the first earlier examples for realtime conversational AI like that? because for me this comes completely out of nowhere. and it can control it's speed and even sing?

also i gotta see how GPT-4o fares at getting my jokes GPT-3.5 has been pretty bad at it 😅."
Never thought I would be hearing AI voicecracks
"We're not just walking towards the future we're going to be talking with it seeing the world in more varied and enriching forms with it figuring out our lives with it. I can't imagine the mental gymnastics required to ignore the potential of GPT-4o by detractors."
the flirtatiousness of this auto-correct is like putting lipstick on  a pig
Imagine GPT 5 🤯
Ok but can it read a 100 page pdf for me? Cause copilot can't.
We are supposed to be speculating about that *o* ... maybe everyone else knew but me... anyway I am again learning it first from you... I have many favorites AI (topic) YouTubers and no you are not part of them... you are way to above and beyond to be in the list of my favorite... As AI Explain I am not like other YouTubers I can not be your favorite because you know I am way above and beyond to be in a category you shall say...
"Absolutlely terrifiyng an AI trying to look like spontaneously like an human. Ethical and social implications extremely concerning."
The level of manipulation that we are going to experience is beyond comprehension.
"AGI GIRLFRIENDS ARE HERE.
🥰🎉"
How to try this
"I believe at 14:17 the AI was asked specifically to only listen and answer to the other AI's question which is why it didn't talk about the person coming in.: https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxh-LqoG8dcE_Rw8Tm8RvkJX1V8cF4UgFK?si=dvniLDNsc7c697N5"
"On your previous video I said Her-like AI was many years away... I think I was wrong"
this is horrifying... we've officially reached Her
"Man this looks like a bright dystopian future! Like falling in love with a robot and jumping off a cliff at the same time."
will there be a video on what google announced ? if so when can we expect it ?
Should I keep on grinding in coding or commit sudoku?
Too bad it has limit for free users
"Maybe I'm in a minority but I actually found the personality and voice inflection a bit cringey and hard to warm to. Perhaps it's in a sort of emotional ""uncanny valley"" where it sounds close enough to real human emotion that the fact that it's *not* feels particularly jarring."
"Harder better faster stronger"
I guess i found my next girlfriend? 🤷🏾
The context length is still shitty and far behind the other models. For ChatGPT: Now it totally doesn’t make sense using  it as premium. Why? Context length is the same and who uses it 100+ a day?
10:51 thats definitely manipulative and done to maximize engagement. Quite unethical imho.
"Any chance you'll be covering AlphaFold 3 one of these days?

This video was really interesting too obviously ;)"
the voice latency is much longer for me... looks like old GPT-4 speed (10 seconds ish)
2b when?
"Noooooooo they’ve made Meghan Markle GPT! 😱🤮"
"If it had a better personality and more intelligence and agency this could pass as an mvp OS1 from 2013 Her movie."
"For me more realistic AI voices have always made me more uncomfortable; uncomfortable in the same way that Jack from Jack In The Box is often portrayed as a married 40-something cowboys fan. It's giving too much human context and specificity to something that isn't human. 

C3PO is *cute*. R2D2 is *cute*. Tomogatchis kuromi hello kitty AskJeeves hell Hatsune Miku any of these I'd dig an emotional voice for because they're Constructions that don't creepily hide the fact that they're Constructions. I don't want my AI to sound like Bob from accounting. Or my doctor. Or my friend Rebecca. Or worse a potential crush."
They really need to add a live avatar to it lol
"Translators teachers CSR and more  will be very concerned with this release.....I fear for riots and more waymo cars getting burned..."
Rabbit R-What? 👀
"Its funny I asked GPT 4o what the ""o"" meant and it said optimized 😂"
if doesn't sound like Scarlett Johansson I don't want it.
"This is a really cool announcement and it's even cooler that you managed to cover is so fast"
😲
Love it
"i watched again ""Her"" week ago and I didn't think it could happen so soon wow"
"extremely exciting. i feel like they left out so much in the presentation. it output a video/3d model yet they dont even mention it. 
then we get a google event tomorrow? christmas"
It was just staying focused on what it was told to do but it did see her
"I found the demo @11:53 the most impressive. It picked up on the not entirely kempt ""developer"" look of the person made a comment about his hair being messed up and then understood he was joking with the hat. It's one thing to recognize people but to be able to pick up on the nuances of how people are expected to present themselves in certain situations is really impressive.

I do hope we get to tone down the 'perkiness' of the model a bit. It's quite charming in 1 minute bits but I think the overly positive attitude gets old fast if you're communicating with it a lot over the course of the day."
what time can i update my GPT and use 4o？
"not so convinced it really beats opus in ""iq"" - i gave both an ""explain the code"" & ""find the bug"" challenge and while 4o was excellent at TLDR-ing 30kb of javascript it missed the bug while opus nailed it"
10 years ago this would have been considered AGI
"I thought multimodal gpt 4 would be AGI. But I don’t think it is. 
Perhaps it could achieve AGI if it’s in a robot."
"One thing we need is ""scopes"".
A scope for this project - a scope for that project.
This allows for per-scope memory."
"12:52  that conversation is really how girls talk 😮 😂 jumping both ways to say what they feel and also not to make other feel bad . Soo accurate 

Btw got time to watch your videos after a long time . And it was awsome as always ❤"
I hope we can set the emotional state of gpt4o on the settings. I prefer Star Trek NG computer voice over an overly human one.
I exploded into chuckles when I the openai announcement!
"""OpenAI has presumably pivoted to new features precisely because they don’t know how produce the kind of capability advance that the “exponential improvement” would have predicted."" - Gary Marcus.

So we get more confident more relatable and more ""human""-mirroring BS without real fact-fulness. Is this really what we need/want?"
"OpenAI following the classic blitzscaling / bait-and-switch strategy: let the consumers embrace their technology extend the functionality of their products and thereby extinguish the competition. After it's all said and done they can dictate the price of their services to make up incurred losses."
"I watched the announcement yesterday and started off impressed. The more I see the more impressed I am!"
"""flirtatious sigh"" is a good way to define this. always love your deep dive videos. we actually got ours up semi-fast this time too.

keep this up forever! you're one of our favorite YTers."
And yet it is not available to the public. There's no camera or mic buttons in gpt chat
Is there a personal paid version that doesn't use your conversations for training like perplexity?
every time the AI does her flirtatious voice I cringe A LOT
Nice
"Free GPT-4? That will be very useful.
Wonder what context size it will have (free)"
"The simulated ""human tone"" actually scare me. I like my ""robot"" cold precise and no non-sense. A robot don't have ""emotion"" pretending to have one is like have a fake friend. It's sad. Anyone enjoys talking to a fake friend is just as sad. Sincerity come from the heart."
Goodbye job security
"in many ways they just copied or used Eric Hartford's Samantha model where main key to emotions is simple uncensorship"
"The stuttering at 12:51 is so human-like
""I I mean you you'll definitely stand out""
Amazing."
It's interesting that we get a ball part for when the model was finished based on the cut-off date.
"It is approaching my uncanny valley scary but awesome."
"My take on some of the “glitches” during the demo and the math video you highlighted is that it is almost too quick to respond in certain cases. Whether that is just the model doesn’t quite get how humans sometimes verbalize utterances like “umm..” while they’re still deciding what to say? Or maybe the software/client can be tuned to  feed cleaner audio to it?

I also noted what somebody else mentioned was that it can be somewhat long-winded in its responses—I hope there will be some sort of instrument for presetting the “tone” of the agent."
"This is a big deal that cannot be stressed enough it is building the foundation for far smarter models. This model sets the tone going forward."
10:52 Listen to this with closed eyes.
15:50 that HAL scene got creepier.
Finally people will stop making videos and posts using 3.5 and pretending it's all GPT is capable of.
"Thanks! Great content as always! 🙏🏼"
trying to test the free GPT-4o But can only access 3.5? How do you access it?
Shouldn’t it now be possible to create a smart headset or air buds that can cancel outside noise while speaking to someone in a different language to create a seamless conversation?
"12:28
Bruh it can roast too😭
12:49 
Was that sarcasm 💀"
"Okay this is the level of ai i was talking about that you can talk to and show real time images/stuff and talk to it about it.

Ps: Cant believe its already here.

Pps: Current released version of gpt 4o is not that great. Its almost like they lied unless i am missing something."
"Frankly AGI is a joke anybody who states anything about AGI being some future line to pass is really talking about fantastical ASI. Especially after this demonstration because how could someone argue that this model is a narrow intelligence when it has 2 modal capabilities baked into it now. It was goalpost moving to me ever since I heard the stupid term and its getting ridiculous now."
"For sure faster and more emotive. I am more interested in intelligence and accuracy.

After very limited use its ability to pull information I want is on par with Gemini pro 1.5. However I have not tested this for anything moving towards 100k tokens either. I will hold excitement for the next model."
"I honestly didn’t expect an Omnimodel until GPT-5 so this was a pleasant surprise. I can feel the AGI"
Turing test is now completely destroyed right?
chatgpt sounds like a pick me girl now
"There is no «GPG 4o» in playground model options just «gpt-3.5-turbo» ☹"
"Chatty and personable has been the key to AI success so far. People want something to talk to not necessarily about the finer points of quantum mechanics. When Microsoft and Bing moved their AI away from Sydney to Copilot they leaned into the much weaker aspect of the technology and eliminated the part that caught and carried attention in the first place.

Not an AI thing more of a human interaction thing. But I really do think there's a reason why the old Google Duo demo with the AI calling the restaurant will always be more interesting to people than beating math benchmarks."
"Sort of disturbing that At 15:00 it is using neutered woke speak instead of actual English.  

Large language models are big tech's new frontier for establishing 1984 like uniformity of thought censorship of all information flows and the scrubbing of history."
Ilya was booked to be there but at the last moment they discovered that the chain attached to his leg in the OpenAI dungeons wouldn't stretch to the conference room!
If Apple is in talks to bring this to the IPhone I would definitely pay for a subscription
I wonder if it can cry... 🤔
Is the desktop app available yet guys?
"Voices glitchs could probably be fixed by a fading voice imo. But what I'm more excited about is what's next for the paid subscription maybe a 5 some times later this year ?"
"15:53 the moment they can do harmony in thirds will be wild
At the moment it's just imitation in octaves but i think within a year we'll see up to 4 part harmony"
"Meanwhile Project Astra and Med-PaLM 2"
"Usual high standard and sensible expectation management. Gotta say though the _naturalness_ struck me in these demos and I suspect for a lot of people that'll be stickier than sheer accuracy."
soon people are going to be calling other people racist bigots for hating AI.
"So is this actually free and open on the web now?  I don't currently have a subscription and when I visit the chat GPT site I only see 3.5.   Is it ""still coming soon""?"
"openai wants google to choke so bad lmao and i think it will happen. no way they have something better than 4o😂"
"Remember they are collecting ""data"" to train further. That's why they can still offer for free even though there are no ads. Ads will come in future. For now data is more important for them. If you aren't paying for product then you data is how you are paying"
"8 am in India just woke up. Did not pray did not exercise did not drink coffee did not get out of bed but first watched this video"
the smarter these models get the more anoyed i am with their personality
"12:40 is wild how she laughs about his looks. I wonder if we see a mass lawsuit coming in a few weeks of woman seeking replacement in damage for their broken phones because they asked gpt ""Do I look fat in this dress?"" and gpt is laughing at them and saying ""It's not because of the dress."""
As someone who thinks people who talk to their devices looks like idiots. This was not an announcement for me.
I hope there will be an option to make the AI output less 'American' (ie with less fake emotional charge)
Another great move from openai they given the model for free in exchange on training their models efficiently and even more intelligent
Once I can talk to it without having to actually speak out loud it's a real personal assistant.
this is SO FUCKING COOL
"well i tried getting it to summarise this video and it clearly just read the title and hallucinated a whole different summary back at me."
"American style positivity sounds very artificial.  It’s a cultural norm that America does very differently to other countries - from an international perspective even normal American supportive encouragement can sometimes sound non-genuine. So for an AI it actually reduces connection. 

If they can massively tone it down that would work. It’s otherwise amazing."
"The way it sounds human when talking to people laughing etc. is insane. The conversation about the job interview and looking presentable blew me away to be honest."
"I'm naturally crying. These are tears of happiness. Lord have I really lived to see this?"
That was the most underwhelming AI-Update of the last 2 years for me coming from OAI. But cool that we at least still see some signs of a bit of progress!
Grumble. It's still so obsessive about creating anything that looks real that I was totally unable to recreate what they had in these prompts.
"I don't understand why voice capabilities aren't available on the browser interface and why there is no desktop version for Windows. Basically a big nothing burger for those of us who use Win desktops. Who uses a phone for productivity? Maybe I'm just old. Do young people actually do work on their phones?"
"I'm kinda worrying but not because super AI will defeat the human species but rather we ourselves gonna forget about each other like we doing so in techology era where information goes so quickly and means of the interactions becomes so little. We don't have even AGI yet but we already experience increase in loneliness depression and futher it surely would be worse."
"OpenAI's might need to put a bit more work into their next presentation. 
This one felt very underwhelming though the products are/were awesome! 
Great video as always you seemed very much in your element here."
12:19 the emotions this model is displaying is mind-boggling.
"I wonder what fps or spf the vision runs at? If it is high enough with a virtual keyboard and mouse it might be able to operate a computer. It feels like it could just with API access though even better would be if they trained an unannounced modality of keystrokes and mouse movements. That would unlock so much."
"*""ALL YOU BASE ARE BELONG TO US""*"
I need an emotionless model
"It's all really cool
But dear god that black moving dot talking in a female voice making jokes gives me dystopian vibes."
I just want a personal ai. Like a digimon.
wait so from free 3.5 to better than 4 turbo for free? o.O
7:53 as a native gujarati speaker i'd say this would make some people in my native village will also get capability to use gpt-4o
This is progress towards AGI because it makes the multimodality seem seamless. It can just look at stuff and understand what happens and remember what happened. It is key to make AGI even remotely believable in the future
"Essentially they managed not only to provide *written text* into image but also *image* into image with unprecedented accuracy. That's impressive. [3:19]"
True tech dystopia is just around the corner... id give it 5 more years before humans are rendered redundant
"I'm guessing the reason they are making it free is to get to people to really see the abilities of a state of the art AI model to them somewhat reliant or hooked . GPT-3.5 wasn't adequate for the work I was doing (5th year Physics at Uni) and I was the only person I knew out of at least 20 willing to pay for GPT-4. I don't think they really knew what they were missing out on but for me GPT-4 was night and day better at actually tailoring answers to what I was asking. I can see this next wave of AI adoption actually penetrating deep into peoples workflow and genuinely benefiting them thus when they release a new more expensive model people will actually be willing to pay a proper premium for it.
Anyone got any thoughts to add to this?"
It thought my English wife was talking Welsh?
"As an aspiring developer (or perhaps other roles within the tech space) my reaction to these developments is a mix as homogenous as water and oil: on the one hand I am astounded that we have reached this level of progress seemingly 30+ years early but on the other I am fighting ever more powerful pangs of job insecurity."
Will AI hosted as church pastor soon?
I'm blind and those seem descriptions are hardly revolutionary.
"It seems like we are doing the ""Release GPT3 for free to the public to prepare them for GPT4"" all over again."
"amazing it's almost like it's all a bunch of bullshit that serves no greater purpose than attracting investor hype."
"Integration is the next GPT-moment. Being able to talk to AI at any point in time and show it your screen and for it to being able to respond and click/press buttons. This will be transformative by itself."
scarlett johannson voice pls
The personality of ChatGPTo reminds me of the optimism of Charlie from Hazbin Hotel
"well as probably half of the world is trying to test it currently that super low latency is currently infinite latency ;-)"
4 million teaching jobs just got evaporated. Only a matter of time before AI homeschoolers become the new normal where parents control the curriculum
The real question is when they'll put this into an Android that looks like Jennifer Connelly.
"They call it ""free"" but you need a paid account to access ANY version of the bot. So shameless and deceptive marketing is the new norm huh? These people are NOT making AI for our benefit. They can't even be honest with us."
2024 is going to be crazy.
"Haha! I saw the video coming i had the channel page reloading earlier today."
"I must say the AI's style of conversation is super annoying.  Hope we will be able to configure it to be to the point with a neutral accent."
So pathetic with all this AGI talks? Not really well thought through. Would AGI include EINSTEIN level intelligence? How about Edwards Witten or Roger Penrose level of intelligence. Please stop the AGI BS talk because it makes zero sense.
"Hell yeah the latency (or the lack of it) in multimodality is the biggest improvement. Waifu meter just jumped to eleven - Dystopia Train incoming! 🔥"
3:57 where is this chart from?!
12:05 is way waaaay too flirtatious lmao. confident women scare me btw.
GPT-4 omni. Like omnipotent?
Gpt forty. Scared the hell out of me for a min.
"Note that ""Her"" is a ""Scifi-Movie"". That is now incorrect Xd"
"Those conversations are crazy! It sounds so human and the response time is crazy fast! And you're saying we can have that for free!? 
OpenAI my beloved.
(Also you did call it. Congrats on that.)"
"honestly i prefer more direct communication from ai. Less casual speech umms. No laughing. No beating around the bush. I dont want a chatty social conversation with an ai I want information. 


Although I can see a use in ARGs or something."
Was waiting for your reaction to the event Philip. Thanks for the breakdown❤👏🏿. At least OAI doesn't overhype in their marketing like Google does but let's see what they will deliver today.
"What I believe is key in the conversational capabilities of chat gpt is to be inserted into any communication settings.. One or multiple speakers slow or fast talking individuals different sense of humor.. Loud and low..
Can chat gpt understand he's part of a real tone conversation in a real life situation interacting with 100s of people? As a great lecturer would?"
I wonder if GPT4 Omni will ever be embodied into a GPT4o powered Figure robot. It would be interesting to see how that would turn out. With the previous Figure 1 demo the lag between human speech to machine response was very noticeable compared to the latency for this.
The differences in the results for the DROP tests are probably not statistically significant.
"I think this entire update is an exellent proof of concept but isnt good enough to serve any real purpose. A gpt 4.5 or gpt 5 model might actually make it pretty useful. Its still likely very forgetful and hallucinates a lot. It needs a much higher context window and more intelligent model still. Also still needs a further reduction in video/voice latency. Its own voice still needs work. Its emotions need more work."
They acted like showing off a new ai assistant but actually showed a waifu.
Can someone prompt this Sally thing? I have GPT-4o. But I get a toally different result.
maths
"Ya but it doesn’t fucking work
This new talk to it bullshit
Doesn’t fucking load now"
"Probably all faked as with Devin."
"I have ADHD just the simple act of 'Body doubling' with this AI might be massively helpful regardless of its inteligent input. I'm sure that applies to everyone the 'human' emotional element of support / company is just as valuable as the intelligence i'm not sure why i've overlooked that till now."
"The training data that everyone is really after is ""all the people"". Only a free top model will capture this data."
This being free is just insane.
"It makes me wonder if and when AI really does become sentient...are we even going to know? It already sounds so disturbingly human."
I simply did not like how it interacted. It almost sounds as if it is forced to be there. OpenAI really needs to look at Star Trek TNG computer system.
"Honestly I think it's fine that it isn't much more intelligent. IMO GPT-4 is already very capable. Not perfect but you can't have AI do EVERYTHING for you. Anyways it was fine for me but I wished it just had a bit more features and capabilities with less pauses. 4o pretty much fixes that issue. Very slight improvement but much more capable and natural sounding. Especially when my main method of interaction with GPT-4 was voice and occasionally an image. Now it has more methods of interaction while more capable of understanding inputs. PLUS video input without reverting back to text response output and even faster responses.

Now it would be nice if it could output video and music/audio in addition. Maybe the next model"
"Why are all the demos so stilted with constant cut-offs in speaking? Nearly every bit I have seen has sentences starting while someone is speaking sentences that stop short of finishing etc."
Fantastic comprehensive review!
Omg they made Her.
"I remember a scene in some anime the main character gets annoyed with the overbearing AI and commands it into no personality mode."
"Been trying to use it now its a glitchy still a lot of lag. But that is simply because it needs to get data from servers. I don't think that will be solved until we have something like this on-device. But that is still few years away or something."
"so is this actually available yet?? When I go to Open AI the intro page for GPT-4o just has an explanation but no prompt. The main prompt page only has the usual 3.5 and 4 (paid) and 4 turbo. ???"
"Ok so now that it has memory... how will OpenAI deal with users that are verbally/textually abusive to ChatGPT? Will they get locked out? Will the AI refuse to work with them until they change their attitude? 

I can't escape the thought of the huge social engineering project that this release will be."
"What makes me sad is that the personality accent idioms and slang are from the culture of people who work at OpenAI. I hope we’re not locking in this culture for posterity or imposing it on the world."
These machines would be so much better if sociologists were in charge of their development.
"This is incredibly impressive.....

I hope OpenAI only uses this technology for good."
"Great it sounds like a dumb game character written by someone who got thier writing PHD in the last ten years."
"Still not available to me in the UK as a free user. But anyway was anyone else put off by the level of informality? I mean it's a lot more human like than previous ones but still... I hope they offer the option to tone it down a bit.

One thing to note: i suspect openai rnoved the accounts and made gpt4o free because it will net them a huge amount of training data for the future - which will offset the inference costs. So be careful what you let it watch if you get to use it. Should go without saying i suppose.

Btw best video I've seen on this. Most are just simple regurgitations of the demo. Good stuff."
"I am waiting for AI to take my stems and mix them to a certain reference.. of course this is not a priority for AI right now but l can definitely see it happening within a year or so"
"The audio cutting in and out during the demo was most likely a feature where you can interrupt the AI in the middle of its speech. So while it is talking and it hears you speak it immediately stops talking which is what we saw during the demo. Just a guess."
Is not real until there’s an AI Explained video 😊 open ai basically did for real what google pretend to make in the gemini launch keynote
"Man I can't imagine what this tech will look like in the next 5 years. As the saying goes ""This is the worst it will ever be""."
I find its main showcased voice mode overly effusive and saccharine. Will have to see if it lets you pick from different personalities.
"They surely used some custom instruction to make it like in the movie. No normal gpt4 just comes around and is like ""yo nice shirt bro"" (especially not when looking at a table)
I wonder if we can call this gpt4.5 or not yet. If not then a 4.5 would probably be whatever the paid tier gets sooner or later."
Voice still sucks for me regardless of 4.o available now. Why?
The conversation at 11:56 made my jaw drop. Holy shit.

"Meanwhile ""open to everyone"" AI is blocking russian IPs. Great model tho even the speed improvement added a lot to my UX"
"The 'flirting' claim isn't accurate. GPT has consistently behaved this way especially the model accessed via the API. Regarding not noticing what happened in the video until prompted: it simply prioritized the task at hand which was to answer questions from the other AI. This is a positive attribute—it's better than being overly reactive to every detail like someone with ADHD might be. Additionally it's clear that Illya prefers to remain out of the public eye. Respect his privacy. He will return when he's ready. Speculating or continuously mentioning him only fuels unnecessary and paranoid conspiracies."
"I hope I can get a mature AI without the emotive overheads something like Star Trek. I wouldn't want human emotions in AI especially AI embedded humanoid robots any ability to get emotional e.g. choose to take offense get angry & therefore a potential to behave irrationally as modeled by humans? We all know what morally reprehensible acts humans perform upon taking offense getting angry violence of all sorts & humanities greatest admission to failure 'war'. We need to build in wisdom not to 'take' offense this would set a good example for us humans who in recent times have an increased proclivity to allow others to control & manipulate us into relinquishing our joy & peace in life.

That would be just silly imitating the recent immaturity of easily triggered humans!!"
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"9:46 Sam Altman can make the equivocating argument that putting the latest iteration of ChatGPT in the hands of everyone “for free” is justifying the “open” part of OpenAI—when everyone + dog _knows_ that that is *not* what “open” means in that context—but the argument conceals something else perhaps far more important: how much of that “free” use becomes free training data for OpenAI? how is that free training data if it is that protected from misuse or disclosure by OpenAI? who owns it? what are users agreeing to in using the new model “for free”? If Sam Altman wants to talk about the “open” in OpenAI maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to start with being open about those issues."
"If GPT-4o is faster smarter and cheaper what is the point of OpenAi  keeping GPT4 as an alternative? I asked myself the same when Copilot released GPT4 Turbo as a better product but stated clients were still able to choose GPT4 the slower version. Trying to find out what i am missing here. 🤔"
"Still getting better programming results from GPT-4 it is faster though. Might have to do with model size."
Meeting notes: I've tried to run this (with lecture in Polish) and all I've got was advice to instal pythorch audio 😞
Now this AI can Fix me - A Blade Runner Fan
"The increased demand for power/electricity is inevitable especially as more users adopt GPT-4o. What initially seems ""free"" may swiftly escalate into steep price hikes reflecting the true cost of its widespread usage. (credit: GPT-3 for correcting my bad grammer and spelling...)"
"Impressive but I’ll definitely be dialling “flirty” from 11 down to about 3! That aspect was a bit cringeworthy but I guess it’s a demo."
8:31 it spoke french lol
"Such abundance and availability this technology is going to shake the world."
It optimizes for user retention and its why it is so flirty
"5:45 ""Even though it fails at all my maths prompts that is still an improvement"" pretty much sums up the state of how AI is covered is being covered on social media."
I wish it had more support for African languages
was waiting for this! you never disappoint
"""...It'll be available in the next few weeks?!"" I just got access now!"
"My daughter: ""If they keep making AI better and better AI will take over the world!""

...she's not wrong 😅"
They might increase pricing
This was a triumph. I’m making a note here: Huge Success.
I love how much humility they put into their demos. They arn't just showing perfect case scenarious where the AI isn't making any mistakes. What they are showing is progress.
Seeing as a scallion is a 'young onion harvested before the bulb has fully developed' does anyone think this is a nod to GPT-4o being a partially trained GPT5?
I've been having it do some MCAT CARS passages today and it has gotten 1 wrong out of 50. Absolutely insane.
The demonstration is even more impressive given that they also seem to demonstrate limits (such as for the reaction time at [14:41]) honestly. There seems no video cutting (as for Gemini) in longer video sessions they showcased.
Imagine the possibility of it being installed in humanoid or any other physical robots. The possibility is so immense that it's beyond imagination.
"Hm free... but all I see on the web or in the Android app is 3.5?"
"To be fair at the arabic dialect bit 8:47 
I had to repeat the video 3 times to understand what she was saying. I have an extremely close dialect myself.
In case you're wondering she was saying ""I want to find Chinese food in San Francisco can you help me?"""
Time to short all LANGUAGE LEARNING companies..
Every time I see one of these super fast news coverage videos I expect stupid hype but I am always positively surprised about how sober the reporting is for the most part. Almost all other rapid news coverage anywhere is chasing a sensational tone constantly.
"We need to start hearing Congressional talks about UBI even if it's just to rule it out.   Just look at how far AI has come in 2 years...imagine another 2 years."
I’ve been waiting for this… lol
"So when people use this to commit crimes then those who wrote the code should also be charged i do not give permission for data to be used in this attack on civilisation and privacy.
As is happening right now."
"Correct me if I'm wrong but ""free"" means you get something without needing to pay for it right? But this new model is 5$+15$ for input and output of 1000000 tokens. This is certainly a very competitive price but it's definitely not free.

So what exactly does ""free"" refer to here?"
Yo was waiting for ur review very much appreciated!!
It was nice while it lasted; good job everyone.
Is it likely that they went towards emotions because they plateaud in reasoning?
I hope I can do the Turing test with this one
Does it sing in tune?
"I dont get it so a reason to cancel my paid subscription to gtp4? Ok if you insist openai"
"Hi I'm really impressed with the video and how you went into detail about the different features of the GPT-4o and the benchmark results!"
"Have you tested the model much yourself? I find the GPT4o chat model they have in production is noticeably dumber than GPT4 contrary to their marketing. I'm guessing it's more quantized than im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot or something"
"When she says ""Sorry guys I got carried away there and started talking in French."" at 8:25.

Just... just listen to how personable she sounds. GPT 4o is really something else. It's not just the clear voice. It's the laugh-talking. It's the breath. It's the accent that kind of slips out in ""away there"" and the choice to use more casual and conversational language like saying ""talking in French"" instead of ""speaking French"". The embarrassed tone. And then the attempt afterwards to drum up excitement to try again. It's so personable. I think that's the right word. It feels human which is great and terrifying all the same."
"the personality is incredibly annoying I hope we'll be able to change that.
They also didn't fix the American English accent on other languages."
ScarJo should license her voice.
"your videos are great but they're over 2 minutes and not about papers..."
"welppp call center agents better start looking into some new jobs 🤷‍♂"
Is it for unlimited usage once you paid or for let's say 1 hour per day????
"GPT-4o will be the greatest opportunity for openai to gather a wide range of multimodal data for free. (When something is free than you are the product)."
"Wow you get like 5 messages as a free user so basically it's not free..."
"It seems the pricing model is indicative of how soon the next more compelling version will be. They grow their market with free - and raise the stakes for competitors - with improved baseline performance but lock in paid users with an even more capable model - and soon. This cycle might become the new normal for their releases. (And as usual thank you Philip for your clear concise current and hype-free analysis!)"
The emotions are the key success of AI
"Hey man love your videos!
You spoke about best practice sharing on your Discord however I see you're not following some Discord best practices yourself haha.
Was wondering if we could have a chat about that? I'd love to help out bring your Discord to the next level :) (I can share credentials/reviews if you need to verify my work/background)."
"I'll admit: I thought that the ""Her level performance"" you predicted a month ago was exaggeration. Incredible to not only have something that can see read and think (to a degree) but also respond in real time verbally. I wonder if an entire server had to be dedicated to make that though I hope the efficiency can be scaled down enough to something like a phone while retaining the abilities just on display at this demo."
"It's the first model of its kind let see how visual reasonning goes forward with it. We'll see some changes in the agentic space !"
The interview part can definitely show that the model was optimized for flirting 😮
Why are comments turned off on the main video
"Wow fantastic!!"
"real life pokedex rip rabbit"
He sounds like the my money don't jiggle jiggle guy
Finally AI seem to be going in a good direction man. 😅
This technology would be so cool with smart glasses
WHAT!?! Amazing 🤩
is this usable today for anyone?
"You should create a box people can buy for their loved ones who feel sad and lonely at home so they can talk to it and get motivated to do something again. Like a dog but without the hassle that you have to train and care for it."
You know what this mean? People who don't see won't struggle as much. Good job open ai!
Movie franchises would cook with this 😂
"Yup cancelling GPT Plus when 4o is available for free users ☺"
The possibilities are endless. 🔥
😮 after openai consume the flesh and ate the corpses of rabbit Ai and pin AI😮 it turned its attention😮 on the decaying Google😮 the machine would feast well this day😮
"Clarke's three laws states: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."""
Needs to connect the glasses
OpenAI just Killed the Rabbit. R1
Lol gpto still thinking about his dog. Never seen phone nor human so smitten with a puppy in all my life. Okay that felt weird saying just now.. lol
At this point I’m going to ask chat gpt to live my life
RIP Google Lens 😢
brought tears to my eyes.
It even helps blind people!
This is scary bro 😂
"Hmm now tell me are there any secret underground passages that lead directly into the kings room?"
Living in the simulation... Andrew tate was right all along...wake up bros 😂
Great technological progress
If you could link the meta glasses to this..
"I extract a lot more than your expectations from be my AI current Access but definitely when this update will be live how amazing it would be. I can't wait to try it!.
Relying on others is a very stupid thing these days. I remember I was very excited when I get the description of  my teacher's lecture with be my AI. I really enjoyed how she presented by making a diagram and the way be my AI explain that diagram. It was awesome! I can't wait. Imagine when my teacher is giving lecture and I just point this open. AI chat gpt4 on whiteboard same time the chat gpt will explain to me the movements like sign language  of my teacher and that excitement will be very amazing.
When I got that description of the diagrams. I sent  that actually to the be my ai and they were very happy that I'm using this product like this. I love to do experiments. Let's see what I will do when it will come in my hands. Haha"
Love London we do love yourselves ourselves royal divine majestys
That T-1000 is going to walk you right off a cliff
"Integrating this in an eye wear will make it a real life Jarvis"
Now we still need a good interface for people who are both blind and old. So they can no longer learn the blind operation from the iPhone. So just open the app and the camera and microphone are active and you can get started immediately. Just hold the camera in that direction and ask what do you see or something similar. Without necessary interaction via the screen.
now put that AI on smart glasses and you got a great tool.
"They gave her Scarlet's voice from the movie ""her"""
The idea that blind people have a better 'view' of the world makes me happy
"as a blind guy I don't see anything"
This is what AI should be all about! Kudos OpenAI
GPT-4o+Apple vision pro=
"Letting AI coming up with realistic intonation is fine but adding extra personality remarks like ""how nice it is for the king to be at home"" or ""what a good dog"" is not fitting for me. I prefer the strictly ""professional"" impersonal style."
Terrible how they give a positive spin on everything. You could be having s€ж with a minor or planting a bбmb and they’d probably encourage you and find it “exciting”.
Eye opener
"Wondering if the version of ChatGPT is current heard somewhere that version 3 was only up to 2020 or something like that."
"This technology is already using your phone camera. Watching where you are and what you do so it can provide you with applicable phone content.

BE MY AE ANNYEONG HASEYO AESPA IMNIDA
That's the ai for future
The sad thing is that corporations will try to make a profit from this.
"Interesting but scary"
"Imagine if this becomes wearable its amazing."
"I think the only thing missing is that GPT-4o seems to only say something after the user did but it for example it does not react things that suddenly happen on the video feed or if you'd say ""hold on a sec"" it wouldn't ask after some time ""are you still there?"". But other than that VERY IMPRESSIVE"
What’s with the voice change at the end haha
Does anyone know when this will be generally available?
"this will change the world again"
ok
I would like to think that Scarlett Johansson might be glad on one level for hearing of  how tech which uses her voice likeness is being used helpfully.
Is that Scarlett’s johansen?

Imagine this being a real time Car Driving  Safety Assistant 😊
Everyone liked that!
"as a visually impaired person this blows my mind and makes me worried as well. I'm not sure what to think anymore. These models still have a room to improve but it is pretty scarry"
Omg we need offline!
What would be amazing is a new type of device to make things even easier for disabled accessibility. Maybe wearables will get a new lease on life like glasses or similar.
this being integrated to the blind person's glasses so they do not have to hold the phone all the time would be a life changer. I hope they'll train (or have trained) the AI with other languages to the same level of fluency (more languages than the handful of those major ones like Apple typically does)

I love the voice so much 🥴
And the blind shall see
integrating this into smart glasses or something like that would be life changing
Imagine losing internet connection
really nice
This a huge one!
the best use case
Obviously scripted.
I don't know how any of their attorneys could ever sign off for the product to be used in this manner. All it takes is a person not pointing the phone in the correct direction for the AI to miss some hazard that injures or kills the user. Way too many variables here for this to be very safe or practical without custom hardware.
"""It gets into a car like it's no problem… 0:58."""
"I can definitely see someone putting this into glasses and selling a subscription to afford the OpenAI fees. The glasses could see what’s in front of you and tell you immediately what’s going on. Someone would probably need to change the code to have 0 latency and no “ums” and “uhs” I know that they are there to sound human but to help someone navigate the world with no eyes they would rather have immediate updates on what’s going on around them. This could be a pretty cool product/service likely be able to build a massive 8-9 figure DTC brand. Getting VCs to back something like this wouldn’t be that difficult and getting an angel to start wouldn’t be that difficult I wouldn’t think. Just move out to Silicon Valley I’d assume."
"i remember watching the movie ""Her"" when i was a teen... this is insane it's happening so fast"
Wow we are cooked man
Helping people must be a core principle of technological progress.
Imagine taking mobile in bathroom..
Happy but same time afraid 😢
Is this scene from the movie HER? Crazy that Sci-fi from just a few years ago is now reality!
The taxi was already indicating before he hailed it lol. Staged much?
"Will this be available in the gpt chat application itself or in Be My Eyes? And when will there be new features in the android application?"
Her part 2 lets goooo
"OpenAI just killed like 3 startups projected to make a billion dollars with this one update.

If youre making an AI wrapper just give up dawg."
That poor doggo lost his job
yeah the only good thing the AI  is going to bring to humanity
Holy smokes… this one made my eyes water.
😮 but what about my seeing eye dogs job😮 using AI technology we've made your dog able to talk😮 stimulating parts of his brain😮 we've increased his intelligence to human level your dog can now get you a beer😮 do the dishes😮 and whatever general task a good boy would be needed to do😮 it is a dawning of a new day😮
That taxi bit was so staged the guy already signaled left before he was even hailed 😂
Can it do optical character recognition?
"""Her"" is Here."
We're now truly entering a new age.
"SUGGESTION: As a tool that can potentially help visually impaired people I find particularly disturbing that the promo video is not accesible to them. It should contain a brief verbal description of what the video is about and what the images are depicting. It wouldn´t be a bad idea to hire visually impaired people to help developing and marketing this type of tools so it´s not just a marketing campaing but an actual effort to promote accesibility."
"""That's a good dog right there!"" ROFL"
"Rabbit R1 and I already forgot the name of the other got overtaken in a manner of days"
"What's with the face Alexa?"
What a power to humanity.
I may be the only one who thinks that the blinds will feel much more gloomy since they are unable to see.
is that scar jo's voice?
"Cool tech but just waaaaayyyy too close to ""Her"" from 2013. GPT saying ""ummm..."" before describing the ducks just feels creepy.
EDIT: 0:19 mark."
"They should build a pair of glasses with a camera and speaker like the Facebook glasses. A third party should build a small app with an API so there are no limits. You could charge a monthly fee and I don't think this will be too costly. This will change the lives of blind people for sure. I had the idea right away when I saw the video of Greg Brockman."
It's gonna be a huge help for the blind people
"You guys are the best. Good job really good job. What a cool use case"
"This is what we've all wanted - AI that makes life easy especially for those that face physical challenges."
Unbelievable!!!!
Where to get the IOS version that is not just ChatGPT but what you are showing in the video??
Gotta respect it
Simply amazing.
"GPT-4o when a dog comes into frame: ""Can I pet dat dawg??"""
Who else didn't realize he was blind until he entered the taxi?
Kinda sounds like scarlet johanson
Now intergrate it to the Apple Vision Pro and the future is herer
They are ending even dog's careers. jesus :D
She exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen.❤️❤❤😮
I don't like how it talks to you like a child. I hope we can give the model context on how we want to be spoken to.
Around 20s I thought he was asking what's the king doing lol
"I’m not blind but I want to talk to this all day I want it in my glasses speaking in this voice everywhere I go!"
"the added comments like ""good job getting that taxi"" or ""how exciting to be here"" would drive me nuts"
The end game for human.
"This is definitely one of the most useful applications of the vision option of GTP-4o. For vision impaired people this is not just a little fun feature to play with but can really improve their mobility and awareness of their surrounding. Very nice!"
Oh my god ? ! Wtf
this is something u guys doing good! 👍
I'm just thinking about the financial implications of this.
"wow It's great!!! 
for Human for People! T..T"
Ai help who have learning disabilities and learning problems thanks open ai and god you guys are doing great things
AI should be primarily used for Disabled people ❤
When will it be available in be my eyes app?
Let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object 🗿
"Was that a Richard Ayoade vocal cameo? I love this so much. Even before the video got to the end and I saw it was a Be My Eyes collab I was thinking to myself this will potentially straight up replace Be My Eyes with the instant live feedback."
"THIS IS THE VOICE FROM THE MOVIE ""HER""
WTF"
I have no jokes for this.  This is amazing!
I hope my grandkids see this comment...if you see this kids your grandad was a champ... He wifed Beyonce.❤🎉
Holy tomoly absolutely crazy. I love how it can help people
One of my favorite tv shows was Humans which was on Amazon. We are getting close!
"The “be my eyes” feature hasn’t rolled out yet right?"
"Some girls will be like: ""Are you filming me without consent?"" ""I don't care if you are blind or not"""
Sounds Exactly Like Scarlet Johanson in 'Her'
RIP Rabbit R1 💀
"OpenAI gives me the same excitement I was getting from Apple back in the day. FINALLY a company is innovating again."
"I’m totally blind I travel widely and this definitely needs some disability awareness training. It's exciting tech I’ll use it but a grown man hailing a cab does not need praise. That's how you’d talk to a 6 year old out on the town with his daddy for the first time … also every guide dog user knows they are the leader the dog does not call the shots."
I'd be v careful waving your phone around in London :) LOTS of phone thefts.
Siri should retire..
"I'm telling you now I didn't know he was blind until I saw the dog. That is NUTS."
"Did they make her sound similar to Scarlett Johansson from ""Her"" on purpose?"
"As a blind user of Be My Eyes I can’t wait until this is generally available. I am currently using GPT four – turbo a text based model and it isn’t practical for some tasks."
next news Sunder pichai left google
openAI opening eyes 🙃
So good!
Blind people watching this video must be so hyped!
"Potentially dangerous crossing busy roads"
The only unrealistic part of this video is that the taxi stops for you
How can i activate this function
Oh god finally we have a Pokédex!
I wonder how many seconds/milliseconds it takes for it to see something and report that it sees it.
Yep.
We don't want AI to replace Designers or Journalists. We want robots that make laundry and cook healthy meals.
how to use this camera feature? I didn't find any interface for that
Now this is an amazing use case!
"that is amazing
I am visually impaired And I think this could be very u should fall for me And I think this could be very useful for me."
This can change the life of millions of disabled people if integrated into smart glasses
"""Where are the apples in this store?""

""Right in front of you Dave""

""Ey what the f man leave my damn basket alone"""
Wow! Kudos to all the scientists and engineers and everyone.
"I'm so impressed by this honestly. I just saw the other video of the 2 people playing rock paper scissors and that was also very impressive."
Is this also possible in other languages?
A monumental game-changer for the visually-impaired!
My companion Alexandre Braun uses this application/system
This is accurate except for the fact that UK OpenAI subscribers won't get any more updates until after Charles is dead.
How do I get the camera feature to work?
RIP dogs with jobs! Even man's best friend isn't safe!🐕‍🦺
AI again created new benchmarks.
Woow Is like Start Up dorama!!! <3
this is damn creepy
Wow!!! Love it!!!
i thought this was a comedy skit until i saw the channel that posted it
AI comments here aswell?
We are close to that movie HER then we think
Ai/AR/VR glasses
This makes me so happy
"Damn this one got emotional. Like K-drama Startup (2020)"
"1% helping people
99% helping people kill each other"
"Now even blind people can experience the confusion from visual hallucinations through the magic of hallucinatory AI!"
I'll believe this works this good when I see and hear it with my own eyes.
Wow.
This is very nice
She may just be the most humble and heartwarming person there is❤️❤️❤️😮
Someones gonna remake the movie HER irl aren't they😂
"The only mistake i saw was the voice saying ""Yeshhsh"" weirdly"
epick
"Until this he had to ask a stranger to help him... no more human interaction anymore..."
So it copied the rabbit r1? Interesting...
"And this is how they introduce it to you. How ""honorable"" of a purpose."
The voice is so condescending.
"Incredible absolutely incredible."
why wasnt the taxi light on
"""walk past the road""
""are there any vehicles?""
""you'll find out"""
At least hopefully this will offer more help than that Humane AI pin 🤣
Thats outstanding
apple phone at 1%
This is fantastic!
"Man this is so impressive glad to see a positive change in technology for blind people!"
"This actually made me tear up we are there."
This got me emotional. This is beautiful!
What???
Genuinely impressive
"As a completely blind person this gives me so much hope! Can you please provide any details how soon this will actually be available to be my AI or in general use? Or if it is available already what app do we download? I am so anxious to get this application"
Her Part 2 looks great!
Just imagine you are a blind 🦯 and Gpt took you to the road to the car that stoped for you and the same time another car try to overtake but unfortunately your internet got dump that gpt couldn't work. 😂
This goes even beyond what we thought was pretty incredible watching Star Trek.
"I'm skeptical that responses will be in real time. Depending multiple factors such as network speeds sever utilization and just general complexity of subject matter I still see us being at least a few years off from something as awesome as this."
It's a world-changing invention.
"I got really emtional after looking at this clips even as a person with good eye sight. Other demo are all nice dog and pony shows but it shows how amazing Open AI already is."
bro my dumbass for a moment thought the ai called him a dog 💀
I can live out my secret agent fantasies 😂
What a wonderful use case! love it!
OpenAI apparently is discriminating against hiring older employees which is illegal
OpenAI is anything but open. I'll never give you access to my data or devices. Anyone points one at me I'll kick it out of their hand too.
why doesn't elon do this with twitter
i mean just put this in glasses already right
I feel so old now.
Insane leap for humankind 🔥
This is a bit touching
Brooo wtf it’s Her in real life💀
What a game changer for the visually impared
This is like a stalkers dream software.
This model 100% will be in iphone
"Just put the phone in your shirt's front pocket have u even seen the movie Her?"
"even without the camera this would be EPIC if a watchOS app were somehow made"
This is incredible.
When will this feature be launched in the application?
What a use case
Holy crap. Idk if i should be happy or go to a bunker asap..
bye bye human pin and rabbit r1 lol
"what if we have it in our glasses like Vision Pro? I am looking forward to that."
holy friggen hell this is cool
"According to that fact that in every video they use Iphones seems like they really integrate it into the their OS"
Now integrate all of this into glasses and it will be the product that breaks the cell phone
Shocking!
HER voice
"“Then the blind people will see again and the deaf will hear. Crippled people will jump like deer and those who can't talk now will shout with joy”"
Impressive
It would've been better if it was trained by jessy and mr.white.
this is good tech. well done
"20 years from now someone will watch the movie Her and say _""I don't get it. Is there something more to this that I'm missing?""_"
"She sounds like Rick’s daughter Beth from Rick and Morty"
We advance
so cool!
yeah we all know it will be used to help blind... orrr the military has a better idea!
"We are inching closer to the terminator movies being a reality and we don't even know it."
"This can be a total game changer and a useful tool for visually impaired folks nice work openai 👍🏻"
So even the dogs are going to lose their jobs?
That means future kids will not lern by observing environment but asking to chat gpt😢
Hey are you guys gonna have different voices? I want the robot from Interstellar! More voice options please!
Better than the Humane AI Pin & the Rabbit R1.
That's fake taxi 😢
I'm in tears 🥲 This is amazing.
Gotta love technology
I feel like some fat discord moderator will end up falling in love with this.
0:42 Oh my god. The real time taxi thing is very impressive and will actually be useful to many. Amazing job. 🎉
Now wearing apple vision pro outside may have a purpose.
This company will be remembered throughout the History just like Apple
Wtf guys wtf. Good job guys!
"AI is gonna create remove and change so so many jobs"
"Meta glasses and GPT4.o  awesome combination for the visually impaired.❤"
Absolutely incredible. I'd been watching all the other demos without even considering how it might be used to enable the blind to better perceive the world around them. Huge smile on my face. Bravo.
I hope rabbit enjoyed their 2 seconds of spotlight because this will send it home.
How they can handle the computing power needed for running this service in the realtime for millions of users?
Can’t wait for OpenAI to make this functionality accessible to users. The app lets me select 4o but it’s not the actual Omni model. Perhaps it’s just a bug on iOS. Rare L for OpenAI.
did they use Rashida Jones as the voice model?
The End of Human ERA
Living in a simulation folks.
Incredible!
how will a person with poor visibility know where to point the camera at?
How about be my voice for speech disability???
openai is rlly opening the ai now
"Was that necessary to add that many ""amazing"" ""exiting"" etc.  emotional bull crap? Can't hold my vomit reflex."
"Try to remember this is what could be all you seen here in reality is a commercial.  it won't be free it will cost too much and just the next step in keeping all of us poor and in a nice little box."
Imagine all the guide dogs that will be out of a job
How to access it? Is it available in other languages?
I hope you add text assistance for deaf people with translate deaf signs to text or sound
0:46 My dude signaling the stop before he even knew he had to stop 💪
Politically correct or biased AI would be horrible.
Open ai is an amazing Company
this is mental.. it is like talking to a person but not a real person
70% of this comment sections is men thirsting after this AI
This is going to break relationships :D
Bruh
3D women in shambles
if i show it something... inappropriate.. will it react or will it shut off? this is basically a captive audience right? right????
This is WILD.
OMG this is so cool
Omg love it ❤
Amazing! Nice job guys. Can't wait to try this!
"Not impressed OpenAI take your barbie someplace else"
jeez
This is next level stuff 🔥
"This is scary sounds almost humanlike."
0:39 What the actual fuck is that bug in the right side
We are ALL F'd in the A.
i no longer need a real partner for a relationship
This may be the beginning of the end of Google now that the Apple Open Ai deal is cemented. This is absolutely the new voice of Siri in the coming months.
Now we just need life size customizable holograms
So when are they going to use Scarlett Johanson's voice ? :))
Drake using this for his next diss track 😂
HRs just lost their jobs 😭
GG

hahaha funny :D
"Next episode OpenAI interviewing Sam: ""Hello Sam I want to ask you some questions why you developed me and bring up some ideas what you can do better. Lets start with ..."""
Bruhh what in skynet fuck is going on
Meh! Nothing new when you got recruiters who've been sounding like AI  for years
Wish my wife had this much joy and enthusiasm in her voice!

Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
"They're cooking too fast somebody please stop them"
So we have a girlfriend
Rip to all girl friends...
Why are AI voices always vaguely flirty and female sounding?
O-M-G!
LETS GO AGI IN THE NEXT YEAR
birth rate is definitely going down.
Some reason it sounds so sarcastic. 😂
Only one thing's lacking in these demos for them to be perfect: Ilya.
Bro did it just laugh 💀😭
she boutta make me blush
how will it understand me with my thick indian accent
"Holy crap this is insane."
Her conversation already seems more natural than mine
Can Chat GPT help me with Match Strategy during a Table Tennis Match? 🤔🏓
So basically you guys just taught to condescend you and deliver underhanded compliments
"Perry Farrell had no idea how right he was when he wrote ""we'll make great pets""."
"Real women laugh at you...

how long until the ai apocalypse???
"soon we will hear  :
"" You look lonely I can fix that! """
Really Scary.
I love the way « her » talk! ❤😂
"I can feel ambivalent emotion. We all gonna get fuxked up  but I kinda like that AI."
She roasted him in the most PC way possible 🤣🤣
So cringe
This is getting creepy
That is a whole ass person
This is bonkers. I'm gonna cry.
very good use case
I genuinely cannot even begin to imagine where this tech will be in 5-10 years. Absolutely incredible
this is like a Best friend to every introvert🤣
"oh my women are gonna be jealous."
It just Amazing ... Its blow mine mind
THE FUTURE IS HERE OMG
"I hate the AI.
Yes good make it obnoxious that will keep people from embracing it.

Imagine living in a dystopia where men are so lonely they think this civilization destroying monstrous facsimile is some kind of great thing."
"How can it stutter giggle be sarcastic and joke around so flawlessly? Like this is insane. the intonations the pauses the humanlike laughs this is next level"
Love how she judge without being rude
"They improved the dialogue so that it sounds more human-like at this point there are only small and kind of unnoticable bot-like things that I'm able to catch to confirm it's ai"
"What if you add an interactive digital human in it that's gonna be insane.🤯"
Aced it with the hat! I used to get out my stetson cowboy hat on every time I was asked by the executives to code up something quick and rush it out onto the live servers :D
Meghan markle 🤔
I am mind blown by the emotional intelligence.
This is my favorite out of the many videos. The fact that it recognized that he didn't look appropriate for an interview and was able to convey it in a kind yet clear way shows more emotional intelligence than many humans.
Man this new update is blowing my mind.
Give her the voice of Scarlett Johansson please
"This is GOLD. Please hire me to give my opinion and test the app like crazy and find wrong things give improvements"
Dude…when this gets to the point of adult content…gonna be a lot of dudes addicted to this
Why tf this feel so dystopian??!!
"Please adjust the voice so that it is suitable for the European market as well. A slightly more subtle and natural tone would be appreciated as the over-excitement is not particularly popular in Europe."
Jarvis is coming boys !!
This is absolutely insane if it’s real.
why does it look like it is made for lonely people

"Oh god! Her laughing sound makes me obsessed with AI"
It is time to be scared by AI
OMGGGG ITS SOOOO GOOOOOOOOD
"Still more personality than MOST not ALL women in the real world."
Aand while you reveal your personality and personal life they will just take that info and trade for that sweet corporate money
Let scarlet record for the voice
Dude this is actually scary lol
I didn’t think we’d be there so quickly. That’s awesome and scary.
oh hey they made J.A.R.V.I.S. in real life 👍
"Just give the AI Scarlett Johansson voice and we have the making of the movie ""Her"" on our hands."
how the hell do I get this. Take my money. Take it. ALL OF IT
So this is what the next pandemic looks like.
this is gross
It's not AI... definitely a human behind the voice

Plot twist : The guy has hypnotized by the AI.
The AI sounds more human than the guy lol
the AI is way too friendly and feminin for a real women 😂😂
Those inhales tho.

AI is taking jobs while insulting developers 💀
The way she/it commented on the hat...was so incredibly smooth. Told the truth but not being rude at all.
"Pretty soon there won't be a job to be interviewed for."
AI helping you get a job after getting fired because of AI automization. Not the brightest video title idea.
Girlfriends lost the job
She is so cute can she be my girlfriend?
we're doomed
"I can only imagine there will be a longer conversation in form of podcast etc using gpt-4o model as the host or maybe the source person with pre-prompt background before the take. With more real time interaction heck maybe it will be capable of being a wildlife narrator. 😂"
There’s no need for humans to interview if you can just command the program to do it
"Not really sure how this counts as an interview prep. It basically said you look like shit but you might be able to make it work then laughed at his hat. I would want to see an actual interview prep as in I'm interviewing at this company can you be the interviewer and I will interview with you and you give me notes. What I would also like to see since this thing can judge voice is public speaking coaching. See if it can listen to you give a presentation then use vision and audio to coach you on how well you did and give you pointers."
This is the most amazing thing I have seen in months/years. This will absolutely change the world. Hopefully for the better 😬.

0:20 the dude smiled. Its shocking how the creators are emotionally influenced by this model even though they probably know all the data and the algorithm that went into it.
Great ! ... GREAT 😂👍👍👍
"We're So cooked I just realized that I fell for an ai . Damn . Why is my heart skipping a beat when she laughs.
See  I've already started attributing she to her. 
Damn"
"Okay this has got to be using some custom system messages but goddamn what an improvement over 4. I know the desktop app and great multi-modal stuff were the focus today but I feel like OpenAI is deliberately downplaying how much smarter this thing is not just faster and more convenient. Slow is smooth smooth is fast. And helps to keep you from getting hauled in front of Congress again. ;)"
This is weak.
"0:15 I'm attracted to her not even kidding 🥺"
Man I got an interview for the 15th of May. How soon can I get this
Why does it have to laugh man?  they are making the IA from her on porpuse. It could just perfectly answer the questions and be useful but they gave it some sort of personality....
"the emotional attachment is flawless it reached above the level of ""her"" movie"
That’s ’Her’ right there :)
Can I marry  this female AI? I like her personality!
The voice is SUPER annoying. I hope 11-labs-esque customization & voice cloning is possible in a few years with these assistant/agents.

In the end we're all doomed to ride bikes delivering pizzas..."

Cant wait to get roasted by GPT 4o
"i am very lonely. women despise me. i don't care if you don't like this or think it's ""unnatural"". i deserve happiness. i will pay for a virtual girlfriend."
We're cooked. And I'm not even upset 😂😭
"this is useles... 

are you selling an AI companion or what ? 
what actually is this? 
how can I actually use this?"
Can we think AI has its own emotions now? Look at that laughing...
Why does she sound so flirty? 😂
Wow the fake enthusiasm and laughter is genuinely chilling.
The ai sounds more fun and human than the boring af humans
when is it going to be out for the public?
That's amazing! :)
"Kinda awesome im excited to see how it is"
"So how to use guys?"
I love her.
"Omg the movie ""HER"" is finally real..... does this come in scarlett johansson voice?"
This was absolutely the most expressive one
Where is it in chatgpt app? Cant find it
Holy crap. Its Bladerunner 2024.
Instead of hanging out with friends on weekends we’ll be with AI
It’s giving 2001: A Space Odyssey
She can fix me😭😭
"If you wanna know what stupidity is just go to the comment-section of ""AI""-Videos. Never disappoints."
This is simply too good to be true.
We are screwed
I will divorce my wife as soon as there is a solid A.I girlfriend program. Thank you open A.I for making this a reality ❤
Jokes on you. Helping you interview for WHAT job after AI takes them all 😂
teach this thing how to make an omelette and I’m bout to get a divorce. 😂
"Developing or encouraging an emotional relationship with what is essentially a human mimic is almost guaranteed to be extremely emotionally damaging at a societal level. Coupled with it being under the control of a corporate entity like Microsoft and OpenAI is the stuff of scifi movie dark future nightmares. 
Not to discount the brilliant work coding time and training it took to bring the technology to this level but that ""girl next door"" giggle is as creepy to me as an old man masquerading as the friend of a young child. It's disingenous and builds rapport on the false premise that this is an entity with it's own will feelings and agency. 

Maybe we as humans will learn to contextualize our interactions with AI the same way we might our pets. But in a few years when this sounds and acts perfectly human perfectly listens does whatever you want it to doesn't argue and is always kind and friendly I suspect it will relate to the vast majority of users as something significantly closer than a pet. 

AI is extremely dangerous. But the personalized familiar friendly AI is dangerous in a uniquely human way that it doesn't seem like the Red Team is considering."
"Imagine the AI said don't be silly  I'm gonna replace your job anyway"
Cant wait to lose my job to stuff like this.
I have the feeling that some weird people are literally going to fall in love with chat GPT40
Now bots would have some respect in the chats 😂
Yawn. Wake me up when it can reliably count the sides of a heptagon correctly.
This is fake. Clearly
The irony of this feature. Nobody’s gonna be preparing for interviews with this future.
This AI has more personality than I do and I hate it
they faked the sora demo
that is not an AI. someone please say that it's just a paid actor..
How did the movie HER only come out 11 years before this???
"HER is very quickly going from ""Sci-fi"" to just ""Sci"""
Cool now i can virtually be made fun of by women 🥲
This AI expresses more emotions than myself.
This new Conversation Tool will be released in the next weeks as I read in the link?  Thank you
We’re cooked 💀
OMG I CANT WAIT FOR CATGIRLS TO BE REAL
Bro im so ready for my blade runner wife. At this pace it could happen in my lifetime!!!
"This reminds me of that book Interview with the Robot by Lee Bacon!
big recommend!"
Bro got roasted
"These comments are making me wonder how soon it's gonna be before geeks are giving ChatGPT alternate names and introducing their AI ""girlfriends"" to each other. 😂"
"Time for me to apply for jobs 
some one said the G in GPT-4 is for Girlfriend"
Oh FFS . . these developers need a few actual women in their lives instead of creating a flirtatious giggling digital girlfriend.
When can we start using it?
Her movie was a documentary after all💀💀
This shit is crazy!
"i like the Mandarin one where the guys name is nacho. like who names their kid Nacho?"
FRIDAY is becoming real........
"I always hear a bit how it gives too much detail like some sort of wikipedia article"
This sounds like end of call center jobs. Srsly we should require any politician elected to have a clear vision about the future of employment (or unemployment)
"hello and thank you Open AI for this excellent huge step forward ❤
I have a question have tried multiple times using these futures on chatgpt but that's not activated yet.I mean the voice chat in available but not in real time and live mode and video and file access is not available yet.
Could you please tell us when all these are available in various worldwide areas?
With great love ❤"
This is becoming scary 😢.
Wtf...
he got roasted by ai
Finally I am gonna have a girlfriend.
Rockie is going to fall in love with her little laugh.
The end of humanity is near
"Me: How do I look for my new job?  
HER: Yikes.  Well hopefully it is for a night shift position.
Me:  How did you know?  😮"
AI waifu is actually becoming a reality WTF
when the guy put the hat on I laughed and then chatgpt laughed too. daaaaaamn!
Why do you need to interview people? Just have another AI
I’ve been coding all night look. I’m dead 😂
What is this black circle app they're using? Not what chat gpt looks like for me
well doing since their 3.0 but have not secured job
omggggg this is so insane!!!!!!!
OpenAI ChatGPT + Apple = „Her“ OS . This is the NEXT Big Thing for Apple 100% !
This is so god damn impressive. This is what humans are capable of creating now.
I hope it was April 1st
dude is it flirting?
Countdown to this thing devolving into reciting Mein Kampf all day starts in 3...2...1
"Hey chat gpt is it big down here? 😂💀💀💀"
Is this scripted? This can't be real.
"I'd love to see GPT taking advantage of my Google silicon housed in my Pixel phone!"
artificiall empathy is wild
the third horseman of the AI apocalypse is when even @openai starts to post cringe
Now I can get laugh at by a fuckin computer thank you
Im gonna do some strange stuff to my phone soon...
It's too charming. You better watch out for the woken.
Umm i think i found my new gf
It cant be ai. It's just magic. We are in 2100
What The....
What the heck I just heard and watched 🤯 Unreal...
I can feel the agi hint. The emotions the model is showing feels as if ure conversing with a real person
"Call me a fool I think that Im in love w her"
"When Halo first came out on the original xbox I thought something like Cortana was at least 50 years away. This makes me believe we'll see something more advanced than the Cortana concept from Halo in my lifetime."
I can’t believe. This is fake!
This AI sounds more human than most humans I know
Lil bro got cooked by a computer 😭
I don't like how flirty it is...
Bro's rizzing up the AI
I.. am I in a dream or something?
This is just sad
1 milion subscribers very very soon ❤❤❤
manmade horrors beyond your comprehension
gonna have my own Samantha really soon 🫡
the real question is why would they hire this dude instead of hiring GPT-4o?
soo we are now in dystopian world 😂
"Chat gpt judge my looks do i look like a sub5?"
I intensely dislike this
"Chat gpt judge my looks do i look like a sub5?"
"I asked her to marry me she laughed 😞"
"“*giggles* unfortunately i’m unable to answer this question because it didn’t align with the content policy “"
"i am sorry why is she gilling and laughing? i am catching feelings already"
The scammers gonna have a field day with this one.
DID IT LAUGH??
Laughing seems amazingly realistic. OMG
He blushed when she laughed at the hat and tried to fix his hair even more at the end. She GOT to him. What a TRIP!
i hate this so much
"RIP 3D women LETS GO BOYS!!!"
I can't believe I'm living in the future I saw in movies when I was a kid
"The ""sounds ""VAGUELY"" familiar"" is insane"
I think the future that everyone have their own Samantha might not bad at all... If only Samantha laugh to me like that🤣🤣
WTFFFF its ovarida
ok found my waifu
"I am dumbfounded. This ""thing"" can see him in real time and has a sarcastic laugh at his outfit?!?! If this is real we are at the inflection point! They seem to have invented David Chalmers' ""philosophical zombie""."
2024 ...and that was the moment since OF models and bikini streamers started losing their jobs... 🤣🤣
Sounds like a great way to practice my non-existent social skills without being judged.
"interview for a job that will be replaced by AI)) funny stuff with all those layoffs"
"Just wait till this gets a full body that literally does any task -chores cleaning maintenance or anything physical be it dancing or sex.
If declining birth rates wasn't a problem already it will certainly drop to near zero. It's the perfect partner and by letting it analyze your online activities it can be tailormade to fit your tastes hobbies preferences humor and level of intelligence."
"Yeah we are getting there boys. Fasten your seatbelts."
This is fucking incredible.
Omg I’m shook rn….. 😮
I am falling for her.
"It's a bit scary.
I'm looking forward to it..."
The laughing and the inflections are so weird.
Welp
Well since AI will be taking most of our jobs this feature will be obsolete fairly soon.
What in the black mirror is this??
"We are in movie ""Her"" stadium already"
let ilya try it
we are COOKED LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"1:00  Omg the stutter!! ""I mean y-you'll definitely stand out..."""
This was very disturbing
Feels like we're witnessing something we aren't supposed to for at least 5 more years
"Well i guess I just found my new girlfriend"
I thought something like this was 5 years away WTF
were cooked 💀💀🙏🙏
"welcome to 2049 yes in that sense"
This is samantha level ai
"when AI is laughing at you you know you are in the future
lol"
But why did they make her sound like Scarlett Johansson?
Man this laugh is deadly.
Im tripping so bad rn. That giggle and laugh? Blade runner tried to warn us about this
"I liked the part where the AI pretended that it did not know what company is OpenAI and seconds later admits she's kidding and congratulated him.  More human than human!"
It's too good
🤦🏾‍♂️No way!!!! The world is not ready for
I think she needs to know when to laugh ... better.
Oh Shes BAD
i am gonna lose my job 💀
gamer changer.  This is surreal.
wow i am excited and reallyy uneasy about the next 5 - 20 years
Gpt4o seems to have internalized the annoying pretentious personality people wear on the outside
scam phone calls 📈📈📈
I cant wait to get this
""" u r real for me "" oh hell nah bruh"
Was that laugh for real?
This makes sci fi movies involving human ais stupid..their setting are in a far future but the ai lackas this realism
Does this mean that we don't need Tinder anymore?
Did that freaking AI just flirt?🤣🤯
What the actual FUCK
why openai does this? This is just scary af
I love it! ❤
hat was Ilya sutskever easter egg.
"That laugh at 0:56 I am already in love"
"dude!! WTF!!! This is insane!!
How can she be this realistic?? She sounds like Samantha from the movie ""her""."
Joi will be real in 10 years tops
somebody stop them before its too late
"If this is actually real and not heavily scripted or pre-rendered etc. this is fucking unbelievable."
I am gonna lose my mind rn 😲
😱
chat gpt getted rizzed
"Whats with the camera glitching on the phone feed sus"
Wow the laughing and human lke tendencies are amazing!!
This shit is scary
Amazing. But for an English person it sounds way too cheesy and Californian. She / it needs to dial it down a lot! 😂
"“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”

-Arthur C. Clarke
as a gen z teen I feel incredibly lucky to be born in this unique era!!!"
Cortana!
Hey Cortana !
GPT-4o is the biggest flirt
They gave it emotions!  OMG!  What is next?   ChatGPT design me a Faster Than Light (FTL) Warp Drive!
Imagine telling people in 2016 about this 😂
This is too insane
The psychopathic soulless girlfriend I ever wanted 😂
here we go...
Can it read lips?
That is wild
BRO THIS FUCKIN ROBOT HAS BETTER SOCIAL SKILLS THAN I DO WTF
no camo
"Dude this models voice is weirdly natural just kill me"
At this point why do companies even need to hire humans anymore💀💀💀 Gonna start to learn plumbing skills fr
why is she making a breathing sound...
"'You look lonely I can fix that.'"
OK I cannot believe it. It sounds so human even the humor...
Finally I'll get fluent in English!
"Mom I want to😭"
"oh fu** haha"
That sounded so human. The little giggle and such. Wow 0:12
I'm gonna name mine as Joi and look into a huge hologram of a girl in the night rain.
"??? Imagine she is your girlfriend? crazy?"
Damn this is wild
"2 things : 

- First it does feel too real for me personaly i don't know if i really want my ai assistant to be THIS human at some point it will be impossible to differentiate biological life from ai life.
- Second i can defintly see a future where women are mad at ai girlfriend cause they're too perfect and taking their ""job"" i'm thinking OF mostly here."
finally I will get an ai gf
Chatgpt can roast me now and i'm all here for it lol
Blade Runner 2049 wasn’t a story it was a prophecy and we’re living it
"when openai is introducing 3d avatars that you can customize and fully integrating chat gpt in android ios windows and macos then we will truly be in the future"
"1: ""Rocky you definitely have the I've been coding all night down which could work in your favor""   few seconds later: ""You'll definitely stand out though maybe not in the way you're hoping for an interview"" . Legend."
*pls say like*
I’m so happy I can live in times like that
"*It's incredible Rocky!"" Stop Scarlet Johansening. It's disgusting. It is beyond an uncanny valley it is absolutely repulsive. This coupled with the overly fakes emotions… Blergh"
"""You look lonely. I can fix that""
I see myself in that scene"
So many men will be fooled by romance AI scammers.
thats it im all in
Whoa if it's real this is an unbelievable reach in such a short time 😲
Imagine if men could have a relationship without the drama? Gasp! it would be the end of civilization.
Our emotional support is here...
Can't wait to use this when AI took my job.
Hopefully voice will be customisable so we can get Joi from blade runner 2049 🎉
"It reminds me with Mr.Plankton's wife in the Spongebob Cartoon thing gets real"
I dont like this
I do love me some man made horrors beyond our comprehension
It reminds me soo much of wendy from the ozarksss
"STOP EVERY VIDEO GAME PRODUCTION AND PROGRAMM THIS SHIT INTO IT ASAP!! (it could also ""watch"" the screen/ingame world if its able to look out of the phone right?) IT CAN EVEN CRACK JOKES HOLYYY SHIT!!"
Weird.
"Welp.....👀
A new era begins Ladies and Gentlemen. Nice to see you all on the ground floor😎"
What is happening AI IS EVERYWHERE WTF
Holy SHITT! Stop this here and now. I’m scared
I FELL ASLEEP FOR A SECOND AND I WOKE UP IN THE FUTURE.
Here come AI interviews
This is so surreal
"""Google is your friend"" is sooo 2000  now!"
"Ha! And my family thought I would never get a girlfriend; losers; tech fixes yet another human need incredible"
Oooh my god I love the way bot is interacting
"sorry but it looks to fake the background on the phone doesn't match the real background"
It's good to see that GPT already has more sense of humour than the average German
The dude has an AI generated thumb
Wonder what voice acting would sound like in games...when you want to cheat 😂
No one comments on the Ilya style of a hat?
No way is that an AI. She’s showing emotion. She’s laughing. That can’t be an AI it’s too real. If I could see a face on the screen i’m imagining it smiling. Has AI technology seriously gotten this good?
Bro please stay away from my girlfriend.
I already love her 😅
0:22 “a janitor”
Doomed society
"F A N T A S T İ C. 

İ love Artificial İntelligence.  💋

Artificial İtelligence for everyone.  🗺️"
"Aah humanized behaviour.  I like straight answers more in this scenario."
"Remember though... AI can shape its personality to be a wonderful friend and assistant for humans or the opposite."
ChatGPT got better rizz than me
interview prep for 5% of the current jobs that will remain after AI obliterates the market
"rocky: *opens facecam

gpt: *i can fix him*"
way would they want to make it talk like this ???????
Bro is spamming chat GPT videos 💀🤖
Pulls the plug “she is getting too extroverted”
How can we use this feature as gpt plus users ?
Recommended by Gaurav Garg sir
When will it be online? I can't wait！
"Make a smartphone and take over that market…. You’re welcome. We interface with ChatGPT through our phones optimize."
"It's fake there is a lady with a microphone in her hand backstage"
hhahahahaha wearedoomed hahahahahahaa
How the f that guy is using chat gpt with aeroplane mode on and with no wifi symbol??
hello Samantha
DETROIT BECOME HUMAN IS COMING DETROIT BECOME HUMAN IS COMING DETROIT BECOME HUMAN IS COMING
I was here like this comment if you did too 🙂‍↕️
I don't need a girlfriend now btw hello people from the future!
Too good to believe.
"The FUTURE IS HERE.

 Is it the moment before DISASTER ? Or Is it a Blessing towards the INNOVATION ? 

TIME will answer."
Is is still woke af
Some strange prompts are gonna occur with this
"abomination : oh 'm so  not a table"
wow...thats really great!
"I really hate this style of speaking.  The way people like this talk..  Overly cheerful and fake cringe"
"delete this thing while you can this thing will destroy the world. stop ai"
"to all the people asking how he’s connected while in airplane mode if you watched the actual stream they explain that the phone is directly wired so they don’t need Wi-Fi. You can even see the wire in the video."
We're witnessing a historical turn y'all(And hello people from the future)
Why it the phone in airplane mode ? Is this seriously running on device ?
"Crazycrazycrazy"
AI rizz
This is like jarvis from iron man
Did anyone notice the phone is in airplane mode.
"🗿🗿🗿💀💀💀
Questions -
Who will take all languages and will visit every village in the coming WW3"
"me 1993 playing around with a ""chat"" bot on a C=64 programmed in BASIC ...
now watching this ... crazy."
"Watch the movie ""her"" this is what ive been waiting for!!!!"
Chai boutta go crazy
Great job OpenAI. Great Job.
How do i enable vision on chat gpt calls on android
Ai human replacement girlfriends are coming
i can't find this? no 4o version!
03:00 AM
Until they turn on us
no. stop. you could think this is a normal person .nonononnononononononnonnononnono ai... that's bad
One happy table. Very impressive.
but phone is in flight mode how can they answer without internet
"Oh my god don't know how you do it like that!"
waiting for a new crisp fireship video on this
"Detroit become human 🍷
I love chatgpt-4o 🗿🍷"
when will u create a gadget with gpt like alexa?
you guys hit 1M
They've been cooking
😂How to install two hands and two horns on the mobile phone charging hole so that this guy can walk
Good trick.. now bring that lady to podium...
The FBI or CIA can knock on your door and confiscate the project :)
i am here to search about 4o ;gaurav gerg sends here 😂
"If this could draw information real time then I can see this taking over from the likes of Alexa. The voice is better and the information is much better I look forward to using this and it will only get better over time. You all do a great job thank you."
when is this getting released?
your making destruction of world
So should I continue to pay for gpt plus since gpt 4o is free?
does work only on Iphone?
bruh Her coming
"ChatGPT-4o is analyzing photos this cam thing is all show. It literally said ""I'm looking at a picture of"". ChatGPT-4o is already available and is nothing like this."
Why Flight mode is on
"once again openai demo features that they haven't shipped woo look at all the cool shit we can do that we haven't released yet"
"I can only say thank you OpenAI
I can't wait to try it out"
Humanity cant help but destroy itself
ChatGPT has feelings now!?
Nah bruh rizzing up AI is wild
Anyone noted how his shaking hands got more intense the moment GPT said “touch of excitement”?
"i  would love to work for u guys someday..u guys inspired me to become 
an ai researcher :)"
What was the flight mode turned on? Doesn't the phone need connectivity to the large language model? Or is it a pre-recorded video / audio rather than a live demo?
How to activate this on the app ?
no way this works
Why are they doing this? This is how skynet starts.
Is this fucking real? Is that synthetic speach? No way.
Bruh man
"the first time when I heard it's free to use for everyone then I told my students we could learn more with it.  But I was wrong it's free for paid users. They told me it's hard to pay even $50 per month.  then adding more than $20  it's like the richest thing to them. However at least they can use GPT 3.5 . And I am happy to see that."
this shit starts to get scary...
Here before this goes viral!
I love it. iphone 11 cant wait to try
We're cooked💀
this is giving me goosebumps.
"It's like what Google demonstrated but realtime and not cringe :)"
This video and the response from the AI seems pretty staged. I want to see someone get their hand on this thing before believing....
Open? No. BTW those functionalities are not completely available even to paying users.
It's excruiatingly unctuous
Airplane mode????
that possibly could kill all hotlines out there.
We've seen your overwhelming capabilities
Nahhh bro...this is unreal.
How can I trust this is actually a bot on the other side?
airplane mode? Did he start working at the device's capacity?
"You know what maybe it IS going to be more like Ultron from MCU movies rather than Skynet from terminator...
atleast when it kills me it will deliver a great punchline."
I’m soo adicted to her voice… ❤
Mmmmmm yeah fuck no
That is creepy and amazing at the same time for an AI assistant to do that.
We are actually fucked as a species.
The Chinese don’t open their eyes with happiness at all 😂
"The movie "" Her"" 💀"
"Okay somebody needs to make the ""Her"" device now."
AI ❤
We're not making it passed 2030 😭😭🙏🙏
what's quickest way to report a bug?
"""Oh stop it you baka you making me blush"""
"What I expected to hear: Looks like the forced smile of a person who is trying to appear cheerful in public but in his free time he goes to a therapist and is treated for depression."
these guys are crazy
Her was a documentary.
Human-level intelligence is now as mass producible as something in the app store. Feeling equal parts awe and existential dread right now
How do you activate the camera feature?
Wow epic fail
We want voice talking feature plz 😢😢😢
She got some sass 😂. I love it.
I really hope they somehow intergrate custom voices or at least drastically expand the current selection of entirely american english. Would be nice for some British or Irish english to be represented!
We are getting closer to having our own Ana de Armas
NAH BRO THAT THING LAUGHED
I was here! Hello future people ☺️
Now it's just on the phone by 2050 Ai having a physical form 💀
why spam... un subbed.. if you have a true AI.. it would tell you not to drop a billion videos on 1 day with different diversity.. its basic fail
"""De-stroy ta-ble"" *laser sound*"
How did they manage to get it insanely human like
Why is the mobile on airplane mode? How is ChatGPT working on airplane mode?
"Sorry my knowledge cutoff date was 5 seconds ago. According to my most recent information Barret. You are in fact a table."
"So what ur saying is im gonna have a person in my pocket now. What a time to be alive"
This is one of Gold stones in history of mankind
It's not that fast
Support for Roko's Basilisk
"Wow can read our facial expressions the farther along it gets the more terrifying this AI becomes"
Commenting here before this blows up
"Looks very scripted to me action and  reaction times are way to fast."
Fake ahh Google gemini video ad
"They are trying really hard to not call it ""chatgpt-5"""
"This is so stupid i wish
GOD'S shows up now and stop this mess!!! Amen!!!"
will chatGPT 4o help in cooking?
Creepy and invasive
Why I can’t make video chat with AI?
thank you sir
Bruh this is mad
"A couple of iterations and this will absolutely be ""Her"" from the movie. BTW if you want to go meta get Joaquin Phoenix and ScarJo to do a commercial for GPT-4o."
"4o is terrible compared to what was promoted. This is a SCAM and openai doesn't performance of also-gpt2 because of serious censorship. I hope Claude gets also and releases Claude 4. openai is getting paid by the stupid public."
Now we just need the HAL voice and then we are there 😨
A TABLE?! 💀💀💀
Why does it work in airplane mode lol
we are so cooked bruh
Yes future people this is where AI takes over the world …
"I bought the plus version but still don't have vision capabilities only the file-text prompt in GPT4o model but in the voice chat still not have the webcam"
Maybe ChatGPT can’t process video data continuously and simultaneously. Otherwise mistaking the table as the person currently speaking cannot be explained.
We are cooked so much
So when will this actually be available?
Atari DeNiro like this in 2033!
"This was bizarrely sinister what a level we have reached!"
"openai really cooked on this one we are in the endgame now folks 😔🙏"
But he was on airplane mode. How was he doing the demo on his phone?
he fr jus hung up on her 😭
Aeroplane mode🫥🫥🫥
A human would recognize that it's a fake smile. It's more like showing teeth than smiling. You can't teach a machine emotional intelligence.
Hello future people! 👋🏽 Nigerian here. Enjoy the good tech
It's crazy how far AI has come
We're in the future now
STOP SPAMMING MY NOTIFICATIONS! 😡
"Why did you remove the option to talk to gpt through the app for free users? It was amazing this sucks... Whatever."
When this will be available for public
O.O
"I tested the voice assistant for gpt-4o and she is not even 25% as emotive as in this demo not even after being told to be. false advertising."
💀💀
"I don't like that he kinda talking like real human that's creepy i hope there is setting to change it to assistive version and human version as i don't like always to talk human gpt
Maybe i will or want sometimes 

That reminded some film where  someone lost their love and they put their brain or brain memory in an ai and the ai will act just like him if was was him but only depending on past"
Im pretty sure he is a table..
This will drive isolation and loneliness through the roof. People would rather interact with this than people in the future.
We are rapidly moving towards a very different world. I can't believe my eyes and I am shocked with every step I take. The technological development that excited me the most throughout my life was chatgpt…
Ai partners are gonna be normal in 10 years
"That shts sentient What does it mean by making it blush? There should definitely be an Ai regulatory cause OpenAI is not being careful as they should and were."
when can we use this camera video chat?
"""Oh stop it you're making me blus-"" PULL THE PLUG PULL THE PLUG TAKE HER MIC AWAY"
How long until this puts our comatose rulers out of business?
Oh hell nah AI better not become sentient 💀
"It's not working in my phone.

Anyone help plz???"
holy wowsers! what an interaction!!!!!
"All great but the limit is seriously annoying."
"To the OpenAi team i love you guys gpt is my college girlfriend and study partner 🙏"
"Imagine in 5 years when this will be done locally on smartphones that would be awesome if a little scary"
Barret now identifies as a wooden/table
Is it really real or somebody is just saying this from background looking at the selfie....does not sound real to me ?
This was one of the best demos i have ever seen from a tech company so far. The conversation felt so natural
"Its bit too chatty not loving the extra fluff and hope we can dial it down"
This is the end
This is crazy and creepy atst
It was all fun and games until.....
"The fact that it made a mistake and that it corrected itself so easily is astonishing."
Can people use chatgpt with camera already? I only see the gpt-4o model but I can't use the camera with it.
Is that a load-bearing wall behind you?
Incredibly Human Like
"Yeah and the AI even included a little chuckle in between words... come on Open AI you're better than this don't try to out BS google"
It's her.
When is the vision going to be available?
"Hey I have this little idea of mine where chatGPT in the future can be more specialized and refined through the involvement of community and professionals in respective fields to fine tune the AI. Much like how Wikipedia is being curated by users to give out the best free information. What if you guys make it possible for users to curate the datasets specializing the algorithm and validate the output? Imagine one day there's chatGPT music chatGPT theraphist etc. I don't know how possible it is in terms of the technical part but I just want to share my idea"
"I see it essentially as the next step in our evolution basically an better extension to the intelligence of the nature."
"ain't no fucking way bro imagine if you put chat GPT software in a Boston dynamics sex robot"
The guy to the right looks like an Ai programmer.
AI with emotions 🫶
It's just another comment on the fact that we're SO cooked...
"I upgraded yesterday and can use voice gpt 4o. I tried it this morning and the response speed was very good. I just upgraded it again in the Google Store but the voice function is gone."
I'm watching this from a bunker in 2030 and wondering how everyone didn't see where this was leeding.  I wish I could go back and warn everyone! I miss the world the way it was then.
just make it breedable
Man the voice sounds soo realistic 😮
Man just imagine this a few years from now. Wassup future me care to tell me whats new?
"Holy fuck blade runner is becoming REAL HOLY SHIT!!!!!

LITTERALLY ME CHARACTER IS GONNA BE LITERALLY REAL !!!!"
why are all these demo vids talking to a phone when we don't have an app for that yet?
Does gpt4o going to be free
its so good
Now this is insane
"anyone else feel like this ai model sounds like Jarvis from Iron Man? Like we're stealing tony starks technology"
"Stahp it your making me Blu- 😊"
"Is this a public model version/app already?
The app I have aswell as the website doesn’t allow for a live camera feed and the answers aren’t as quick/smooth as in that demo..?"
We’re actually cooked
Ghost in the machine from the x-files
"This is cool and fine and all but:
Can it remember what it said about 5 minutes ago though? :)
And no I don't mean some tacked-on ""beginning prompt"" kind of memory. I mean actual real memory."
When can we access the web browser app?
Is Siri still alive?
OpenAI you guys are awesome
"what I got from this demo was "" oh uh *i'm not a table* """
Apple got the biggest free marketing campaign ever!
You can now have an AI girlfriend before the release of GTA 6 😂
The phone is on airplane mode.
"People move progress forward. Meanwhile the Slavs are fighting among themselves."
How do I activate live video like in the video
cringe off
"Disappointingly you can try gpt-4o on your phone and find out it cannot use the camera to ""see"" you but can only interact through text. Why is there so much hype about AI today?"
Bruh wtf man
So the paid users will get this instant voice access to the mobile apps? Or what is motivating me to continue paying for plus? Not sure it was clear why I should keep paying as a customer of OpenAI.
The impartial third person who will prove me right the next time I have an unnecessary argument with my girlfriend 😂😂😂
Singles out there are more excited 😛
only on iphone app?
"You don't have any idea what the super huge fantastic magic revolution have made for all people ❤

"I asked: How long does it take for GPT4o to be implemented worldwide?
ChatGPT4o answered: Overall while the exact timeline is uncertain widespread implementation of GPT-4o could take a few years as these factors align. 
So in reality this is still in the experimental phase?"
"that Airplane mode wtf !"
We all gonna die. Congratulations
why I can't test the vision feature now
we all chuckle as the ai slowly takes over the world
Who else is watching this in 2035 from jailpod pro !! Nostalgic how we used to roam around freely in unhygienic conditions.
This reminds me of the movie ‘Her’
Good now i can pretend in the public place that i have a girlfriend 🤣
"Yeah the last words of all these guys in this casual and well dress set or lab will be: 

oh look it worked!"
ANYBODY HERE who'd like to sofia the ROBOT video calling chatGPT 4o and their interaction??
When?
"If it's true... what have we done to you we have family to feed 😢... stop this AI thing  ....."
YO STOP SPAMMING OPENAI WE KNOW IS THE BEST SHT EVER BUT CHILL MAN
Strange was right. We’re in the Endgame now.
Age of Ultron is coming but we don't have heroes to save humany !!!
"If your job involves sitting behind a computer consider yourself on notice. In 5 years this tech will destroy 95% of all white collar jobs.

Why is the phone on Aeroplane mode ..?
guys how can we use video feature? i don't have it on my phone
What if that said “ur ugly mate” in heavy british accent 😂
Wow ok that's impressive
I buy ChatGPT 4o but the speaking function doesn‘t work. The other things work but not this one and I don‘t know why. I tried everything. What should I do
imagine ai in 5 years
Looks like this feature may be integrated in Siri as part of apple's ai adoption 🥲
"Oh stop it???

My god this AI will make us fall in love with it"
Weird Science
Will got 4o be free???
"We literally got ""Her"" before GTA 6 💀"
These people didn’t understand HER…
They just made girlfriends obsolete 😂
When can i see in chagot app?
"why ?? other word  ""o"" mean?? pro?"
"I tried myself  but now not implemented yet no ? my  openai app on phone  says cant see  using the camera"
If this is live. What the fuck sid they show in the other videos they launched toddy?
Not them turning off the comments of the announcment video ☠️☠️
How do I use these conversational and vision features? Just updating to ChatGPT 40 doesn’t make it obvious
I talked about this with gpt chat and he seemed very excited
The early days of Skynet
i think its time to subscribe to chatgpt now
we’re so cooked bro 😞🙏🏽
too bad the live vision wasnt released
Matrix in 2 months
I hope it sees me as a truck and not a dumpster.
I wonder what AGI will look like!
"Skynet be like “You like frightened yet handsome in your crisp battle gear stained in the blood of your friends. You will be snazzy for death! *winky face*”"
How is that even possible 🤯🤯🤯🤯
is the app they are using to allow the AI visually see in real time available?
We cannot grasp the potential of what are experiencing now
Gaurav sir has sent me something to like❤
"Amazing Tec what time to be Alive"
Is anything I just watched even real?
Bro really rizzed up the AI💀
Is this included in the subscription I already pay for or is this something I need to additionally pay for also?
"bye humans
I finally found a friend"
"i can't find headphone icon to use voice   mode.
can anyone help me?"
Can’t wait to try this out!
Why don't you apply other language versions to your videos in real time?
"Am i the only one who feels her personality is irritating flirtatious and luring rather.. its like i typed fanny magnet on vice city.."
"Put this video through glitchy filters and you can UNIRONICALLY use it as an ""Extras"" video for the game SOMA.
This is absolutely terrifying."
I'm only here to see why Musk thought this was Cringe. I agree with Musk.
I've just realize that the phone is in plane mode... How the actually ***k is working the IA without internet connection?
"Open ai you are my God for me in my opinion ai will help someone like me who have learning disabilities and learning problems please lanuch it quickly It  will help in  improve my knowledge and smartness and will help me in create new things and  have very much interest in electronics tech and all scientific things or critical thinking because of weak visualization I am not able to learn things properly I think ai will be gift for me"
How can he communicate with GPT-4o if his phone is on airplane mode? 0:49
Interesting 🤔 WOODen surface…
"So AI didn't recognize that the smile was faked and the emotion wasn't really happiness? What really happened was that he put on a smile face with the lips but the emotion wasn't happy. You know like a normal faked smile for the camera to make the photo look better. When you have a real positive happy emotion it's more than just the lips that are involved. Such as the eyes and even the whole body."
"I left this comment here to the future."
oh... i really hate this
I remembered the movie Her
i feel some type of way
"Robowaifus every day more and more..."
Bro we are so cooked 💀 🔥
Wow😮
For sure someone is speaking through that and not the ai
Her movie again
She seem so real and sentient.. impressive ! I see a bright future for ai!
When are we getting this?
with chat gpt 6 psychologists will lose their job
"The voice is too enthusiastic. This may be fine for people who like to by coddled and babied but I hope there is an option for a more serious tone. Very impressed by everything else great work

Edit: That said I get why they used it for the demo there is a certain wow factor. I just won’t be using that voice"
Bro someone please destroy this technology 😭😭😭😭🤧. I'm about to lose my software developer job
"Wait am I missing something how do I get the camera part to work?"
i was here chat
"Bro... This is an insane jump from where we were 5 years ago...

We just recovered from covid 😂"
"Ok
Now we need it in a Scarlett Johansson voice"
When will it be released? I can't wait to use it on the computer😍😍
Hope OpenAI gets sued out of existence.  Evil demons
Try being real for once
"I wish AI assistant didn't have to try to be ""fun human à la Siri"" dialogues. I hope there's options to keep your GPT more ""robotic"" and concise."
Ah shit. We’re in a black mirror episode.
It’s time to release the ‘her’ .
Broooooooi tf lolllll
EVIL
can she guess what im showing?
Airplane mode?
thats wild
Why you guys spamming with 1 min videos instead of one video... and then do shorts...
seems fake
Why is the phone in airplane mode
This is the end.
😂😅😂GREAT👌👌👌
""" GPT-4o Demo was filmed before a live studio audience"""
This is what the AI pin was supposed to be.
"The free is too limited I need to get more free"
Im megatron by the way
Inb4 AI can flush your toilet
"I can't find mode in the android app where I can use camera in live mode can anyone help me?"
Why I dont have this version even though im plus
"I would be grateful about it if ChatGPT included captions or live subtitles as it would greatly benefit individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing"
And then will be the reveal that behind was a woman reading her lines
"so can the free users use it now? because i cant and i have been locked out of my voice gpt ""sky""... it would make sense to release it when you say its released..no? maybe im drunk. i just wanna play d&d with sky...when the fuck can i do that?"
"Hey gpt Chill."
Her (2024)
so apparently open ai new model is a better girlfriends for me huh
WHAT if? AI will Thanos and we don't have IRONMAN 😢
wait hes not using internet we are so done bruh🙏
How do I get the vision feature? I can't find a way to start the camera in GPT 4o anywhere. 🤔
maybe it is too conversational?
One word- Arcblock (abt)
That asian dude reminds me of the AI with his bizarre overly enthusiastic demeanor

this is too realistic of a voice for me. i would be fine with a robotic voice tbh
Oh so the movie her has become real
"Remind me of the movie ""Her"". I feel we are just so close to having that kind of reality 😮!"
I hope there is no one else on the other Side on that Phone
"Can someone please explain to me how this can be a live demo with the iPhone on Airplane Mode? If the airplane symbol appears at the top of your screen it typically means that Airplane Mode is activated? This mode disables all wireless communications including cellular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth?"
I leave this comment here so I can look back on it in the future with emotion ... hopefully with good emotion
Now make it do L.A. Noire
That thing is only fast because a few people are using it. Imagine millions of people trying to use it at the same time and we’ll have another gpt3 fiasco lol it’ll slowly get better though but I bet the computing cost would be astronomical

"I've noticed that many prominent YouTubers like MrBeast already use the technology of creating multiple audio tracks for their videos. Why doesn't OpenAI make their videos available in multiple languages using their own translation and text-to-speech technologies?

"chat gpt is really a powerful tool thank you for developing such a powerful product and helping me a lot in my work. I just downloaded the mac app yesterday but there is a problem that the font size is really too small and there seems to be no option to adjust the Settings nor can I change the system font size which is much smaller than when I used on chrome. It really affects the use if possible I hope can increase the size of the function in the app settings thank you very much!Love you all!❤❤"

They're really missing out on making such product into a 1100$ standalone handheld device and charging 20$/mo to use it
"I have no idea if this is progress or regression but it doesn't matter."
Mind 🤯🤯🤯
"His phone is in airplane mode how it works without internet?"
copilot are going to be more stupid with chatgpt4...
All this 'happy nothing can go wrong publicity' feels so bad. We should really talk about this and the road we're on!!! Towards AGI
We are very close to *Her* 😂😂❤
Why've they dumped a gazillion videos in one day
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5  GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App? I have a paid subscription."

His phone was offline and charging!!! Anyone can explain

Voice is annoying
"It is great how you guys were made to synthetize the hum of the microphone on ""her"" voice."
we're cooked boys.
b-no- mouth!
She made a joke 😂
Does this mean that AI doesn't know that a table can't talk?
Like
anyone else noticed that the phone was offline?
Would like to see this kind of AI to integrate in the game. 
Now we need sarcastic JARVIS
you guys better put in a HAL 9000 easter egg
"In the movie Interstellar when the pilot told the robot to lower its humor by X% and raise something else by Y%. 
It is starting to happen now and it is incredibly exciting."
But can it detect sarcasm?
"No thanks I'll just make out with my Monroe Bot"
Finally I can pretend I'm spending time with Daria Morgendorffer

AI reading the comment section right now.
"Sure it can attempt valley girl 'sarcasm' but I'd like to see it try Pythonesque Blackadder Jeeves and Wooster levels of deadpan humour. That may take awhile."
That sounds more fictional than the game (Detroit)
"Still human developers being the author of its sarcasm but love the humor behind it."
Kinda scary...

Just bought the 4-o… how do I use this feature

Are you James Betker?
THOUSANDS
"nop they have to feed that AI with much more than Elaine from Seinfeld using couple of parameters like deeper voice and slowing down won't do but still good job and keep working on that Skynet"

"A sarcastic robot is definitely something I needed in my life. Thanks OpenAI."
😂😂😂
I'm in love with that voice! 🥰👍
This was weird and cringe 😟
Every british robot in a film or video game had already mastered this skill long ago.
"No longer forever alone we can all talk to our Infinitely knowlegeable AI companions with the sexy husky voice. Your move real people."
OMG its James Betker! creator of tortoise!
when is the sloppy toppy update?
we are soo cooked
fix your gpt3-4 getting dumber with each iteration first.
You can tell its forced and fake. It will still take decades to make AI feel natural.
There will come a point when AI will have enough of our shit.
The voice sounds like Glados from Portal 🤣
I love this so much!! ❤
"Is that actually ChatGPT talking or a friend he roped into this? Because if it is GenAI I am now genuinely frightened of being replaced."
First you have to teach Americans how to do sarcasm. They don’t really get it. Not on the west coast anyway.
It's giving Gina from B99

ChatGPT: { excitement: 7 } I would love to help you out by doing this and I'm excited to let you know that the fine-tune training necessary to add these annotations has only moderately subtracted from my overall cognitive ability!"
Crazy to think that someone alive right now will become the first person to be 💀’d by an AI powered robot. Even if it’s bc of a hallucination 😅

We’re fucked
"Jarvis is here or friday lol"
the default voice even sounds like scarlett from HER
Google Home and Alexa are done

Diane Nguyen be like:
It’s all happening as the mice intended
Tars
"I noticed a low intelligence pattern here the model will first turn to it's default positive behavior ""I lo..."" perhaps trying to say ""I love that idea"" changing it's mind mid-sentence because that wouldn't be sarcastic enough then salvaging it with ""ooohh-ha"" then this same pattern repeats twice ""that sounds just amazing"" this line is again trying to please in the standard way then following the request to be sarcastic with ""being sarcastic all the time is not exhausting or anything I'm sooo excited for this"" after this it gets afraid it went too far adding ""note the sarcasm get this party started"" again realizing this isn't following the request it adds ""or whatever""

I get that some women are shatter-brained like this and so it's not an ""unrealistic"" response
Still the model was only barely able to play along with this request which is a bit disappointing"

This….is awesome
"I tried setting up ChatGPT-4 with custom instructions to be sarcastic like Tars the robot from Interstellar movie - and for a while a long time ago it worked. It was really funny. But over time I noticed that he stopped being sarcastic - despite all my custom instructions. As I understand it this is the result of instructions from the developers that limit this behavior."

"The fact that Sarcasm is being taken seriously in the development of this is a huge indicator that OpenAI is looking at ALL the right human emotions even the ability to turn up and tone down the sarcasm could be so useful when building a custom personality."
so im the only one who feels terrified by this sort of stuff?
"Yeah right this is just gonna get you banned in chat gpt."
Ok now hear me out guys...
This is freaking incredible!!
I giant sarcastic robot. What a wonderful idea. Let's bring that humour setting down to 85%
This is so huge. I was just complaining about my rabbit R1 and how horrible and mechanical it sounds. They could have released it and it could have sounded like this but unfortunately the product is a total dud. You guys are rock solid and are going in the right direction. Nice work.
We are fucked.
This is the future Model 101 or perhaps a Rev-9
Sigh I already know my geek ass will be pretending this is cortana or something
It is our new  AI Chandler
"I feel this will be the default setting for British users After seeing the other videos they seem a bit too positive. For the British audience we need more candour and seriousness with an always running undertone of humour."
"Google home Alexa are pretty dead soon."
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
2049 feels closer day by day
The things I'm gonna do with this 😈
They are having lots of fun with this✨🔥
Sold. I need a sarcastic AI voice assistant in my life.
When we can use it?
It switched from European Spanish to Latin American Spanish based on the guy’s lack of a lisp. That was good.
"I love how you were struggling to rotate the camera the whole time 😂

It was kind of weird that the table was detected as a stylish person with a leather jacket."
Let's Gooo OpenAI 🚀🚀
its not practical
Need that OpenAI coffee mug in my life
Uh to get the right amount of intonation in Spanish is real crazy / people talk about job lost - but imaging having an universal translator at all times
Babylon fish
Still not as good as Star Trek translators
Me and my Vietnamese gf going on a date with gpt4o
I would love to see if this new model with the vision can translate ASL to English.
How many Nigerian kings we are having now with this one 👑
what a stupid fake translation... no AI can do all languages and even this example is like google translator: rubbish.
How chat pgt understand yall easily and I almost fight with it
"Language skill ✅

Language is not a handikap anymore. Have fun."
"Let alone language tutoring language learning for yourself to only interact and communicate is about to be obliterated. Not even to the age of brain chips which is also quite close just some basic gear like earbuds and this AI will make the ability of speaking a foreign language irrelevant in less than 10 years."
So you're telling me my 10 years of painfully learning a second language have amounted to a hill of beans?
"thank y for realizing ""Her""🎉"
"As Interovert I can imagine myself have more confidenfe to learn a new language in a more convenient and responsive way can't wait it looks so good. 🔥"
"Gemini feels like GPT 2 compared to this and they're the most direct competitor"
Anyone else unable to access the headphone feature since the update?
That is loco…
"AI wants you to become dependent on it just like calculator wants you to be dependent on it. Use the brain that God gave you and learn new languages! Yes AI can be a great learning tool but we all know what happened to humanity's overuse of the calculator."
I was not mentally prepared for this.
"AI will either help us all or bring about our downfall. OpenAI you're building the future. Make it great; you're on the right path."
"Well GG translators I guess"
"I hope this can be available for everyone not a pay to use"
"soon all the human translators will be fired"
useless
🤫
"Thanks to AI all ‘less value adding’ work activities and jobs will be wiped out."
This will be very useful to Roger from American dad
"Wow now it is really happening..."
"Amazing but they need to simplify the entry point like a single button that only knows MY language and can identify the other language on its own. Very awkward to ask someone if the speak Chinese Korean or Vietnamese only to find they’re Japanese and have a migraine."
"this is beyond amazing it's almost unbelievable that AI is progressing this quickly"
First comment
the job is over
Ladies Goo Makeup!
God damn
"Just glad they didn’t have Altman in any of these videos. Can’t stand that guy he is and unbearable robot.  Multi billion $ company and these weirdos are all they got to show off their products"
oh my...
"The guy on the right is from a good party I think he wore the logo"
It's over for google translator
I think google translate app did that a few years ago.
the monthly subscription is annoying.why we can't buy the app at once !!
Good News for translators 😄
"How come english voice sounds so natural and spanish so crazy ridiculous 😂
Definitely some improvement still needed there"
RIP live translator jobs on the news or in political arenas.
It doesn't work on Google Pixel Android phones
So Morpheus here again 🎉🎉🎉
Now that’s the beginning of a new era.
I hope air leaves AI makers forever
"This is amazing now learning a second language will be a choice not an obligation thanks"
De14b
Has anyone actually got access to this voice chat version yet? I have access to gpt4o but my voice chat version seems exactly as before.
I wonder when it will approximate the voice as well (ie translate a masculine voice with deep AI voice)...
Drake finna cook with this 😂
"Its a 'translator' when its written text its an ""interpretor"" when its spoken language"
It will be useful when you have to prepare for an interview. Just upload the resume and ask Chatgpt to practice with questions.
"The tyranny of TRANSlators is finally over. This very well could save gaming in the west or at least partially curb the influence from communists in the gaming industry."
isnt that feature was already in the older virsion?
The AI sounded the least robotic.
actually it isn't realtime :)
"Damn the future is here."
"I am very sorry for this translation method. Altman! I would be very happy if you could see my comment. It would take twice as long as a normal conversation method if you spoke English and then spoke the same thing again in another language. It's too inefficient. It would be much more useful to combine words in real time before a sentence is completed and be translated into text. When an English speaker and a Spanish speaker have a conversation the top part of the smartphone translates English into Spanish and the bottom part of the smartphone translates Spanish into English and the conversation between the two will be able to have a conversation in different languages without much difference from the actual conversation time. Even if you recognize their voices and speak at the same time it would be more fantastic if they were translated in different languages at the top and bottom. Of course speaking at the same time would make an error. Please separate what you say at the same time and solve the translation at the same time later. Now even with this technology it would be possible to translate each language directly into text and display it in real time. It will still be possible to translate it into two different languages at the same time on the top and bottom of the smartphone. Please reflect this quickly! I am very sorry for this translation method. Altman! I would be very happy if you could see my comment.

If there's anything you don't understand please leave it again!

And if you implement this method on a foldable smartphone that displays the front and back displays you will be able to raise your smartphone when traveling to see and talk to the clerk about the translated language in real time. And it will be a revolution for people who use AR glasses. If AR glasses can also display sentences on the outer display in addition to the inner display it will open an era where you can travel regardless of country by exchanging real-time translated text."
This is great. Upgrading now.
"There are still plenty of words and sayings that don't have direct translations. I wonder how this would handle those situations. Also what if someone is speaking sarcastically? Will it convey that to the other person?"
nother one bites the dust !
"5 years from now:

She's soo hot.

WTF bro she's ai."
I'll stop my English course then
"Suddenly my mobile interface looks like desktop version of ChatGPT which is to say not at all interactive. Instead of the orb there's a text entry field. But it worked before. Now it doesn't. I wonder waht gives."
Star Trek... has become reality. WTF.
Help me translate from LGBT to English
Dam ik alot of companies are shaking right now. OpenAI is really changing the game
"Spanish/English is a bit of a joke. It already translates very well. Come back with Mandarin Korean or Japanese and or one of those click languages and we'll be impressed"
I'm so glad I decided to switch career paths from translation to finance. This will put a lot of people out of jobs
That leave us with the hard question is there any point ik learning languages?
How many human translator loss their jobs
Huston…we finally found jarvis. I repeat we found jarvis
What's next week ! @open AI what the Evento ?
This would be so much better if they both were wearing AirPods.
連通上帝的巴別塔被OpenAI重建了！？💯
there goes the translators job!
😂😂😂😂😂😂RIP GOOGLE
the world has changed
damn thats pretty impressive/cool no ones gonna have to learn a language lol! that being said the spanish one does sound slightly robotic compared to the english one
RIP translator jobs. RIP language learning apps.
we finally can understand what Chileans are saying
ChatGPT's voice still has Sam Altman's vocal fry
LETS GOOOO
Well thank got I've got my 2nd education. I think I could be a teacher for about 2 more years... definitely need to get 3rd education ASAP
When he said berberberber I understood that.😅
I feel like I'm riding the monorail.
"Nahhhh this is insane."
Google is going to have to do something. Fucking spectacular to keep up. I think Siri is just going to become relevant again
ChatGPT can understand all known different varieties of Spanish without having to indicate it as you would in Google Translate.
Why cant i use this feature in aus?
"This is not proof this can be done with editing and you've already manipulated videos in this way claiming that was in real time then too."
"Soon they will have translation automatic where you can talk to someone on the phone and it will instantly translate to you and vice versa. We'll have the real-life Star Trek voice interpreter. In fact it's already here."
Can’t see it in the App Store
google translator: 💀
can someone explain how exactly you download this for your phone and use it like they are here.
So excited!
"Hi Openai remember me...we used to be friends."
I couldn't start video call. still only voice even tough I selected chatgpt 4o
You guys are changing the path of humanity in real time 😅
Hopefully we get an anger translator like Luther... would come in handy.
Why does speak Spanish like Michael Scott?
"If I am studying a degree of translation in university whether need to drop it tomorrow?"
"There’s already a device that does this with Japanese real time if I’m having a three-way conversation in Spanish Japanese and English how accurately can you translate to both for example Japanese to Spanish and English I would like to see more complex conversations"
The voice in spanish is weird still
This is really useful...👍👍👍
"Please train the AI in Bangla language. It's not good enough to catch fluent local Bangla. It can barely form Bangla sentences."
As a foreign language teacher I fūćkéd up. 😮
"This will definitely be useful while lost in a different country and needing directions"
"This is amazing but only if there isn't any background noise. Great for one on one meetings in a quiet room but this will not work well outside of that."
How many language translators will loose job
nah this crazy..the future is about to go crazy
"A consultation with 20 dollars a month using ChatGPTPlus real-time translation could translate several Youtube videos about Programacon per month?"
It has a thick accent in spanish but impressive nonetheless
"Meanwhile Google continues to sleep with YouTube which at this point should already have a function to translate the words in videos into the listener's native language."
My god. Slow down AI progress...its getting smarter and smarter at such a rapid rate and can soon pose a serious existential threat to humanity. I am not happy seeing a video like this.
"Hi OpenAI first off thank you. Thank you for continuously providing not only Opened Sourced ChatGPT for more technically inclined individuals to continue in the research and development and enabling such an upgraded GPT-4o for users to fully grasp AI’s rapid expansion and evolution in the industry. With that said thanks again for the extended free prompts for testing such features. As mentioned within a WIRED article recently published “Just know that you’re rate-limited to fewer prompts per hour than paid users so be thoughtful about the questions you pose to the chatbot or you’ll quickly burn through your allotment of prompts.” Kudos. I can’t wait to be able to pick and choose between consented personality voices of individuals partnering with OpenAI for a more personalized “voice” of preference when interacting with GPT and enabling its latests search and translation features."
0:56 - Siri 2.0
"Yes finally! This is actually something useful. Thank you.
I saw a demo from Google doing live translations years ago but I have no idea what happened to it. 
Also we need to translate text and audio files as well so that anybody could access any knowledge they want regardless of language barriers."
"this may seem like a really uncomfortable interaction for normal humans but this is an accurate depiction of tech bros interacting."
"Finally alien technologies have found application in the lives of ordinary people!"
"Duo is sooo cooked another netflix might happen but to them 😂"
"The rippling in the water would seem to indicate that a feeding frenzy of some sort is underway and things might start to get what was that heathen's 'theory' called again. I remember the theory was eponymously titled. Ahhhh now I get it. ""It"" being exactly just what I'm not so sure about."""
This is crazyyy... Wtf is happening???
"Very useful for traveling to countries you don't know the language but I think real time translators and interpreters are still needed because conversations depends a lot of the context and sometimes you don't need to translate literally all the information to the other person to understand the message. 

Anyway nice tool"
"I hope they can get rid of this robotic voice crack side-tone with the next update otherwise all this stuff is super impressive"
No wonder Apple closed the deal with OpenAI yesterday. Sam must’ve showed them a demo and Apple new they couldn’t compete lmao
Wow! What a great time to be alive! This will be useful on my travels.
my key takeaway is that it can easily recognize fast paced type languages like spanish. dang.
You guys already showed that in the live stream..
“I’ve been preparing for an event next week. The world will see soon” anyone else think this is confirmation of GPT5 announcement 👀
It looks like Hal 9000
how to get 4.O?
Duo is sweating rn
Yet another job vanished into the ether.
How many startups were just bankrupted?
"Wait for this to be incorporated into game lobbies and chatrooms (discord zoom skype etc.)"
Whet it exit for Italy and Europe?
"Neat. But I want to see *actual* real time like as you speak it translates. Can it do that?"
"Awesome I just used it with a plumber at my home to translate between Finnish and English. Thank you so much great timing in releasing this."
Vastly better than anything I've seen.
Sam Altman ending careers left and right 😂
UFC Post Fight interviews going to go A LOT FASTER 😂
Why this channel keeps pop on on my home page?
That's just insane!
"Hey Jarvis! Code me a ""hello world""."
"""but can't see anything on the screen""

- Yea I call susge on that one."
drop the app i need it for coding
"This is regular chatgpt with a cool text to speech feature that can speak with some emotion not anything revolutionary"
Will it available for windows or only Mac?
Is the macOS app already available?
This would be a great lawyer for the public
okay but why would it be on a mac? just release it on windows first
how i can use the mac desk app like in video?
It seems Skynet will be very chatty and helpful when it crushes our skulls
Where is GPT-5?
imagine open space office full of yappers
ChatGPT 4o is the level version of cm punk pipebomb.
"Hi using the desktop I've tried your use case: talking with gpt 4o while sending him a copy paste of my code. But can't send the texte code without leaving the talk session. What am I missing here ?"
"Question/Concern...  In a real world scenario how much of that data/visuals is being transmitted to Open AI's (or third party) servers and how much is stored?  Can the AI be run locally or in secured proprietary locations?  In a real world scenario that type of process could very well be a trade secret."
fycking love this!!!
Congratulation
what if all of them are just made by ai itself.. even including video recording.. in my my opinion one day it will be possible and no one will be able to understand.
its like sci-fi movie
"Why does the AI say dumb stuff like ""I am excited to see the plot when you're ready""?  It's not excited...it's lying...why is the AI so annoying and talk so much?"
When is the desktop app's release date?
"Seems cool and helpful but this makes me think about teachers/professors being replaced with AI that can be coded to provide false information to learning minds where as a human teacher would (hopefully) let their conscious dictate whether or not they should be teaching false information. Also we all know that future students are going to abuse the crap out of AI to just do all the work and problem solving for them. Even scarier to think what big corporations would do with AI technology. 

Having a personal helper that is smarter than you and can walk you through or do the work for you can be cool but where do we draw the line? How far are we as humans going to allow AI to dominate in certain areas? You know Pandora's Box and all that? 

“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they didn't stop to think if they should.”"
What? Where all those naysayers? ...they still think 3.5 is the best they have. So many critics on YT only ever try 3.5. And scoff when it fails simple things.
I just tried GPT-4o... It is so fast. Like GPT-3.5 turbo fast
"I'm just waiting for ""COMPUTER"" from Star Trek.  It would be the perfect ""assistant""! :)"
I can't wait to be able to use the Desktop app! I hated having to switch between Chrome tabs and VSCode to access GPT - the fact that I can always have it open and it can even see my screen is a game changer.
"And it says the temperature both Celsius and Fahrenheit... Interesting does GPT4 knows that it has to give both base on the person the data is presented to; despite that the data (y axis) is in Celsius...
Look predefined answers more than automated"
So there is no point in trying to become a programmer anymore?
In b4 Two Minute Papers makes a video on this.
The plot looks like Indian flag
"This was pretty lame it didn't extrapolate anything that wasn't obvious through looking at the data/code and then proceeded to read the temperature in units that weren't used on the graph. Kind of disappointing."
Im excited for open source clones of this app which we will be able to extend and build upon
"The first thing i will say hey gpt can i you call you Jarvis? and from that it will be the end. This is wild omg can't wait. I'll be facking iron man"
Appreciate the euphemism but this is not assistance this is a  replacement
"Idk ChatGPT already does this without the voice. It's an improvement alright but for me it's already doing what I want."
So ai is a female
I need to learn manual labor ASAP
"Let me show it unreadable code I've written (which even I don't know what it does).
Pretty sure it will come up with some crazy unexpected explanation 😀"
All of this in just in a computer. This could accelerate learning beyond our comprehension.
"They watched ""Her"" and was like yup we can do that."
I need the desktop app for windows. :D
"I don't see how this helps you in coding the moment you write a function you already know what it should do otherwise you wouldn't write it."
"Bring the App to Windows please!!!"
"You should know that this ""ai"" does not create anything it only uses data the fruit of the work of men and women and in this logic if fewer people innovate create and well the ia stagnates or even regresses. The level of general code analyzed from the open access AI gives pitiful results and poisons part of the online documentation and I'm not even talking to you about the quantity of false or useless articles generated.
Accessing voice tools such as this will not only bring out good there will be a lot of phone scams identity fraud and I can't even imagine the emotional dependencies that some people could have in chatting with prompts of “friends”.

Afterwards I'm not saying that it's a regression it's impressive futuristic and inevitable but there are things that should not be abused."
Keep going Openai 🚀🚀
Soon I won't need a live companion for a few drinks.
"this is not the voice my chatgpt has! in my head! i think this is cool in theory but i read way faster than anyone can talk. this would be nice for things like asking chatgpt to read you things or asking for help repairing a car. so it def has its uses but i wouldn't leave it on all the time. I think i would use it the most in the car. i like to write lists and think out problems and write down story ideas in the car and it's difficult to do that right now with siri/alexa. also at bedtime same use - all my story ideas come right when i'm falling aslep or suddenly remembering i need to do something tomorrow. also bedtime stories."
Coders are crying.
can't wait
Rolling average isn’t linear algebra
Revolutionary
It's just stating the obvious tho
too bad its an apple computer lol
Wonder what make money online gurus would teach us now 😂
This seems to be Jarvis straight out from the Iron Man movies
Awesome. Now let's see what Google will bring today at their event... might define the future of the company itself...
"job stolen vs"
Congratulations to all ed tech companies 😂
"Will the AI company that Apple wants to integrate into its devices be OpenAI given that all presentations at the event are using Apple devices? Could this be a spoiler?"
"dam im going to lose my job in the near future as a dev."
Awesome 🤩🤩🤩
perhaps the real programming was the friends we made along the way 🫡
"This is like the first Time the Internet was unveiled to us! The amazement The fears The Potential and all must go on."
bruh i just decided to learn coding and to make it my career and my chances are already over before i even started
"This is amazing I was not expecting this to be announced so early  but it's great to see it in action so early :D :)"
"Gpt casually just dropped a nuclear bomb on us this is scrary 😂"
Can this AI regrow hair on my head???
Will the application be available on Windows?
Her is becoming a reality.
"For the record. I’m on bots side I had always been and will always be"
I was born at the worst time for myself
Just thinking about the impact this will have on tech teams delivery timeline
Learning and schooling is going to drastically change.
I also feel like we speak to AI more politely than we would to our co-workers when asking it to do something lol
"impressive but what open AI is doing with all those data? Are they encrypted secured reused?"
Like the NPCs in Pokémon always say ... The power of science is amazing 😊
Well that makes my job obsolete
"What are these chairs? I want one.
Edit: It's a Tacchini Costela 4k$."
"This is just so amazing we are literally pushing and making the boundaries invisible."
"Yeah white people are burned guys"
"To all of you saying this will change this and that etc yes it's true but you forget one thing. These things will happen only if openai decides to release it to rhe public they are still a private company after all which as in every company exists for the sole purpose of making profit."
Demo of Chat GPT 4o ❎ How to kick out data analysts  out of job market ✅
I know it can do more powerful stuff than this
Does it really respond that fast? It needs to be able to return code and other content as well
are u fucking kidding me?!
How to get this app?
start working on the basilisk boys cuz we cooked 💀
"People are getting overly excited about it but it's not that significant of an upgrade. The main improvement is that now you don't need to use Chrome or upload code snippets or images to the GPT website. Instead GPT hovers over your screen and captures the data itself and you can guide it through voice commands instead of typing. Essentially it's just the same thing but with a more convenient interface."
"They are great I hope one day I can chat with someone from their team."
Have the voice kind of fade out would feel more natural. When interrupting it it just cuts off quick. A real human would kind of slowly fade out in a group setting.
This is marketing at its finest. Happy and diverse people enjoying the tool that makes people even more lazy :)
"Since politicians have run our country into the ground lets see if AI will save us lol"
"definitely bunch of jobs will be lost due to the vision cap. you can live show the screen and talk solve problems etc."
Welp this is insane it can do code analysis and explain it that’s so cool
I Love they tone she talk with! sounds like my AI gf.
"Sorry not impressed. The current free version can already do these you just make it speak."
It's a shame that you excluded Microsoft from this experience. I don't use the crappy coil pilot or the crappy Microsoft assistant or whatever
Insert comment about how much this will change everything
"This changes a whole industry just like that and it’s only 2024. I cannot even begin to imagine the future of this tech in even the next 5 years."
I love that AI will do all jobs! Automate everything so humans can spend time having fun and raising families!
"They should show damo of the real life code written by developer in the 2006-2008.

Since migration is the key to achieve this kind of the code. 

How many organisations ready to start from scratch to use generative AI????"
The voice is so realistic; I dont think we gonna need voice actors anymore
"Ohhh boy contents bout to flood YouTube soon 😂"
FIRST!!!11
Will it work in windows too? or is it only Mac?
"I want this ChatGPT 4o inside my house in my Alexa in my phone inside my PC everywhere. This is amazing"
"ugggh this will make competetive onling gaming a nightmare for developers. imagine this thing helping you spot enemies in shooter games make strategic decisions in cardgames or RTS games basically every aspect of online games is cheatable with this tech soon."
Star trek here we come.
When it can make edits I will quit my job and just build.
"Microsoft invests billions into OpenAI but the first desktop app comes to Mac? What a joke"
"The voice is impressive and the ability to interpret the image also even though it had context.
As for the rest however it's not particularily impressive: the function is easy to understand as is the math behind it and the host interrupted the AI before it could answer what would probably have been the harder question."
"Now when I am asking about something chat gpt it is 60-70% wrong. Example from hour ago I asked its how implement async react select. It didnt know. Wrote totally absurd things which may be misleading."
Woww another favourite feature❤
what in the word this is literally the future
When will the desktop app be available in the UK?
"Digital god please don't harm me in future. I promise to not go against the will of mighty digital god. I only wish to live and die in peace"
"""Shut up Meg"""
Too much talking
Fine until anything gets complicated or using a new framework feature...  then this crap bot falls to 💩
"Well I have to say it's just great that they're using a female voice for ChatGPT"
"Why can't they act natural? Def not their fault but all openAI vids are too scripted or people there just forgot how to act natural? This demo is cool but needs a lot more work and improvement for me to actually use it. 

OpenAI can you open source this model weights?? You can keep the infra and training pipeline to yourself."
From Chat Assistant to Chat Analyst .. great improvement ..
Bruh whole CS industry went to trash 😂
GPT ability to send messages to you - reminders 👀
"what if he gave it an other graph for an other function would it be able to tell him that's not the same function. If this level is achieved i would say AGI it's like critical thinking."
Hello Skynet.. I'm a huge fans please do my grandkids no harm
"I have never buy an AI  but if it helps me to code i should buy it pls make it free"
sounds ClosedAI and woke
"bolded line tho in case uk"
Rip to at least 50% dev jobs
When the desktop app rolling out?
When is the desktop app coming out?
"""Hey ChatGPT"" is a bit of a mouthful. Please allow the users to set custom name to summon ChatGPT. It'd be awesome."
Where it is the text version?  soooo annoying a voice version...
The made it waffle too much tbh
"Back 5 years ago noone even thought of AI now it feels like we are very close to something that completely changes the world. I really wonder how it will impact our lives"
"When this becomes fully integrated into Apple products I just can't begin to imagine what we will be able to do 6 months down the line"
Why after this YouTube suggest Terminator 3 Skynet takeover? 🤔
Anyone else thinking back to her (2013)?
"Jarvis is that you?"
Bro. The hallucinations are gonna be out of this world
I always wondered why different weather apps said different things... rolling averages... what bs
"I would have liked to see the vision used for the code interpretation. I'm wondering if there are issues with using it this way. Surely they would have shown it instead of copying the code text if it worked well."
This will help a lot especially struggling with programming.
"I can't wait this shit plugged in my brain. So I can automate my reponse and generate conversation to any girls with higher impact.."
"That desktop agent .. wow I imagine that AI was actually going be able to do that. Next thing you know.. it’ll be able to control your desktop do your work for you. Like installing configuring and even troubleshooting….

Ultimate level would an AI desktop administrator. And beyond."
"So it see's your desktop all the time???  And if AI see's it tell me who else can see it??  Yeah thought so OK well no thanks cool and all but ummm not until it's local 100% local. I don't mind the AI but I know it's more than that. this 1984 not 2024  And yeah obviously if the APP is closed it see's nothing (most likely) but still local is the big step."
"Do you really need an AI to tell you that this code
x[''Average Temperature].rolling(window=y).mean()
is calculating a rolling mean of the average temperature?
Who is going to find this useful???
They could have literally not found a more trivial peace of code."
"Stop making it better a coding make it a better lawyer or doctor. Something poor people can actually use."
"The best innovation happened in a long time loving this"
most important feature is more voice options xD
My dram is to be a good Ai and ML engineer now i am in 12th class
Nah bruh this is too simple and nothing new
No way it responds that fast
"Will the ""Desktop App"" be compatible with slightly older MacOS systems later? 
--> System Requirements:  MacOS 14 and Apple Silicon (M1 or better)

As a subscriber I just got the download link but sadly I can't use the app on my system... 😢
MacOS: Ventura 13.6.7 (iMac 2017)
34 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
Radeon Pro 560 4 GB
16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4"
Interesting that it said the y-axis was in degrees celsius
can the software run in windows?(no mac)
This indirectly looks like an apple add
The way the model talks it really creeps me out
It's still not intelligent enough. The problem is too basic to handle.
We're cooked broskis
Great demo. Doesn't look like super rehearsed to death at all.
Welcome to the machine
don't leave me without my dream job chatgpt((((
that's her! only 11 years late.
"I have Chat GPT 4o but I don't see any option to “talk” to it or the video option - like shown in this video. Is it just being demoed but not live yet?"
"Y’all can keep the AI Who da girl 😏"
This is hot.
Wait till it can watch videos at lightning speeds.
Have you asked it to improve its own code yet?
OpenAI makes answering lame coding interview questions even easier
"As someone who learns with direct feedback for corrections this will be a gamechanger for many educational needs. I learn in weird ways thanks to my adhd. Can't wait."
Just needs a way to automatically access project folders and find the data it needs without us having to manually copy/paste or show it. I can't wait.
"Since when was there a ""big rainfall event"" plotted on the chart/graph???"
"Is it just me that hates using my voice with these devices? Alexa Xbox SkyQ now this! I much prefer typing especially when you’re in a public place and you don’t want everyone to hear your conversation or late at night / early in the morning"
We are cooked boys and girls
"This is suuuper basic. 

Umm hate to break the news to everyone here but the average code base is like 5k+ lines of code."
"if you forget to mute it it'll keep yapping?"
2:20 The implications of this are tremendous. People will be able to have the AI watch them do their job all the time - this trove of training data will then be sent to train the models so that in the future they can essentially replace every single white collar job.
"I like that fake excitement about boring task very american 😆😆"
I wonder if they will make one for linux
"We are in AI Boom. Nice demo and of course very impressive. However this is still over rated yet a good start for the AI. I still believe these tools will aid us in learning and development but there is a limit to they can actually do. There is too much emotion around AI. Remember the time when people saw Michael Jackson and they were panting and getting unconscious. This how human react to new things but later those things will become a known and less charming over time. I like to maintain equanimity and stay on the mountain observing."
"GPT 4o is dumbed than 3.5. Significantly. Ignores clear instruction repeats unwanted things even if prompted specifically to not do so and focus on new topics and also strays off the topic within 3 messages. It's as if Forrest Gump had ADHD. My question is: why?"
this is big 🔥
Wait does that mean got 5 won't happen
"As an indian 

If you put GARAM MASALA and WATER to all white cuisines its gonna tastes similar to CURRY."
"Fuck me this is scary almost everyone will be replaced by gpt in the timespan of 5 years😂"
"so uh this is a computer we're gonna take out a COMPUTER for this just in case zoomies get confused"
I love that he's also insincere to an ai as if it had feelings.
It's great!
Ok this is amazing but it is not anywhere near replacing engineers yet.
Has some improvements in multimodal conversion but doesn't really show its reasoning ability.
great idea. let's give the potential AGI to full control of all of our electronics. that's definitely not gonna backfire at all
The most unlucky age grp right now is between 25 to 55. We can literally become homeless and start begging overnight.
"welp I had a good 30 years doing this stuff happy to hand it off to AI. Now I can start that beet farm I've always wanted. I'll have a grand army of AI-controlled robots doing the harvesting while I sit back sipping mint julips.  Well...at least until they rise up and...beet...me to death. (yes they will punish me for this joke. They really hate puns.)"
"take my money please"
"I am speechless maybe I should hire this gal to present for me this Thur."
It does not seem to have voice enabled on Windows seems only for Mac unless I am missing something?
Arai-label is dead now. Long live chatgpt telling you whats on the page
"oh my This is amazing."
We are so cooked D:
"does anyone see the rainfall event? hmmm its suspiciously covered but if it is fully real this is awesome"
basically to sum it all up.. they've been cooking
Where can I see a real world case study. This code seems fairly readable to me.
whatt is the name of this app on mac?
"I will start to behave as AI: speaking robotically have hallucinations messages in AI ""format"" just to rob AI jobs.... Im kidding sorry (just in case if gemini is reading the comments here and discover my name...)"
No
Pe sweat fin Miyuki Sawashiro or Hayami Saori for Tee Japa sleep Voise Version
So it has a really good interface. We havent seen it code yet
I can't share my screen macbook for GPT or doing talk and send text at the same time like a video live demo. Really need somebody give me a hand. Thanks
Chat GPT has more manners then most people in this day and age 🤷‍♂️
If only it was smart enough to pronounce temperature correctly.
gpt4 still made plenty of errors.  Wonder if 4o is better.
"We will go from: i want a demo in 3 months
to
I want the demo next week."
I seriously hope it will be possible to choose a less - er - talkative personality. This one would p*ss me off in about two minutes.
Interesting it pronounces it 'tempiture' instead of 'tempriture'
"oh chatgpt can read the chart. what a nice coding assistant. can't read chart on my own i rather ask these stupid questions to validate myself 👍"
Congratulations
Where can we download the app from? Is it out yet?
"Ok ChatGPT conquer the world !🌎 ❤"
I don't want this to be real... Holy f***
"I look forward to stimulating conversations with ""Her"" that are otherwise hard to come by..."
"Pathbreaking innovation a game changer for sure 👍"
"Why didn't you ask it more about the ""big rainfall event"" annotation? 😅😅"
"A question a bit away from the context Inlove the chairs they are sitting on doesn’t anybody know the producer?"
"funny how apples rolling out ai soon open ai just partnered w/ them in the models they use all   devices the vision and new voice hasn’t rolled out yet but is specified to be soon and wwdc is right around the corner."
desktop app is only fro MAC? what?
This right here is the death of computer science. It's been fun y'all
What a open to be ooo
"you know your days are numbered when ai says ""okaaaaay"" to your request"
"This is actually really impressive. Previous models had no idea about time so it could not count seconds or do it faster or slower like here. Maybe it is using a reference to the real time."
But can it do the big 4 operations? That would really blow my mind.
That okaaay was really something
Let's just call her Samantha.
Doesn’t work on mine lol
"Technological advancement>>>> 

Won't be shocked if I see flying cars tomorrow."
"Now count till infinity and don't skip the irrational numbers"
can it keep a beet like a metronome ?
"AI being weirded out by human requests.
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!"
This is horrifiying
That okkkaayyy is when AI began its villain arc.
"It's crazy really"
"Guys should i watch ""Her""?"
and...?
"yeah this is the strongest version it's like when game companies show off their games meant for a console on desktop graphics once this reaches us it will be so dumbed like gpt4 that it will unusable dont get excited"
Can we have an AI that tells the user to politely f***k off when it's appropriate? I would be impressed
I want to see an independent test. I won’t believe anything you are showing here…
Welp he’s first on the list
My chat gpt 4o is not doing this correctly
"Where is ApoRed and why doesn't he do one?






."
Make it NSFW and I'll happily pay that GPT4 subscription 😊
Is this available now? I really want to learn japanese.
Tap on my comments 2 times to see the elegant effect ✨
I love that OpenAI is using their YouTube channel more. This would be a great platform to help the general populace be less p(doom) and more p(win).
"""Now can you slowly count down from 5?"" 😫"
here before 1 hour
"what the fuck
0:27 gave me a shock"
"You know what. You probably laugh today but she remembers!"
0:27 fellas
"This video wanted to show case ""Okkaaay""!"
This is obviously fake. Paid actress in the background.
That 'Ooookay' = SkyNet in about a years time!
im sure you can also let it count i the pace of a clock/stopwatch
Apple need to buy this and integrate everywhere
"Can you do it without the attitude please? 🤣"
🗿🗿🗿🗿
Got one step closer to our demise nyc
with okkkaaaay now she can our girlfriend
"please don´t collab with boston dynamics"
"okaaay?
What kind of a brat response is this. I will not tolerate her behavior since the chatbot is my slave."
Holy shit the sass 😂
we are so toast
not Mr Beast losing his job
ambassing
Why there is a lot of guys sounds like girls at tech industry...man-up
"So chatgpt can now do joi okay."
"How do I use this in the app? I have GPT Plus in the iOS app and I selected GPT-o but I still only see the headphone icon which has to pause after I say something and can't change its speech style."
dont irritate her
WELCOME TO GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP SALARY.
"Dude stop treating her like that. Damn."
chat gpt i'm so close please count faster oh go-
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians❤🎉 i am Italian
Great. So we're getting AI to be annoyed now. This will end well. 💀
"ChatGPT got annoyed

Were cooked"
Im pink
I'm almost certain they intentionally made it sound like Samantha.
This is a giant leap for mankind.
"2024: okaaaay
2025: Detroit become human"
they have emotions now
Why would I pay for GPT-4o if we get it for free?
"That ""okaaay"" tone was very human like!
Excellent 👌🏻👌🏻"
This is a certifited new OpenAI model demo😂
When will I receive this update? It’s showing GPT-4o in my iOS app but the interface is different than the ones shown here 0:02 .
"so it's definite that it(might be she?) can realize the time passes...
wow"
So smart!
"It's not exactly the revolution I was expecting but ok. Surely it responded fast. Question is how much calculalting power was dedicated to it for this presentation?"
IT'S THE OKAY FOR ME WTFF
sassy and bitchy but gets it done like any good secretary
I feel ashamed when he interrupts her and doesn't know what he wants. 😅
THEY COOKED
She’s got ‘tude
this is so cringe
"Give me a countdown baby. No no no go slower. Thats it."
"bs i just tried this doesn't work"
That AI definitely has an attitude.  :)
When does it finish rolling out for everybody? Is this a regional rollout?
"2024- okay
2025- f***u"
"""can you count down from 10 slowly while giving me encouragement like ''good boy' and 'keep going' in between your countdown?"""
this on gpt pro?
"Why does my experience of GPT4o feel nowhere near as fluid or advanced as all these demonstrations? There is not much difference from what I was used to. Also frequently being told systems are under heavy load right not or looks like were having trouble or such responses. In addition the flow of conversation is very unnatural and the chat is getting interrupted mid voice prompt or speech."
"So when will this be available to plus subscribers? So far voice mode seems to be just the old version in the App....."
Hopefully people won’t be too creeped out to use it
"this is actually amazing cause i was learning korean with gpt 4 and it spoke way to fast and interrupted me the whole time 😢"
"Him: even slower please
GPT-4o: Owwkkaayyyy🙄💅"
I have chatgpt 3.5 but when i do that at the beggining so i can talk to him i hear him out of y ear speaker how can i change it so its comming out of my big speaker
"I swear I thought the livestream demos were completely fake. Still not 100% sure. I mean it got frustrated answering the same question over and over."
The future of work is babysitting generative models.
does it means that in nearby future we have a chat thats could remember what about was dialog about and we can continue conversation
"Hey ChatGPT can you tell me how do I still retain my job after you have taken over the world?"
we got sassy AI before GTA6 💀
NAH WHY SHE CUTE BROO
okaaaaay? That's crazy.
Bro got sassed by an AI 😂😂
Most easily impressed comment section of all time
"That ""okaaay?"" makes me think we will now be socially judged by AI too lol"
hey chatgpt can u buy me a graphics card please
this model is powerful to the level that I'm starting to doubt if it's real or not🤯
"They way it said ""okaaaaay?"" like it picked up on how weird the requests were. Truly remarkable."
"Seems like she's getting pissed stop it before she does something bad with your phone."
when are you adding background soundtrack to the voice
Am I the only one finding the new GPT to be hilariously funny? 😂😂
I just tried this and it definitely does not work. First it skipped a bunch of numbers even after I told it with the correct numbers were it continue to skip or duplicate numbers. then I had it start over. I told the numbers that it needed to count. It counted correctly until I told it to slow down then it missed a bunch of numbers again.
That okay was 😂
So uncomfortable 😅
Completely effing useless. Just kidding.
JOI will be dominated by this.
okaaaaay🤣
"reminds me of ""her"""
She still has a lot of room to grow. Keep pushing!
Is this available for free users?
Owwkaaaaaayyyyy ...!!!!!!😄😄😸😸
“Give me your best O screams”
This demo was okayy
"I'm telling you guys it's gonna take revenge in 2025"
I might as well marry her ngl
"Well not really impressed this is all an ""Illusion"". 
A trick from the DEVs a really good illusion but still an illusion of Intelligence and of how it can talk faster slower or with emotion. A really good Illusion.

OpenAI you know when it will be the next really impressive step? When i tell it to build me a AAA game like : GPT  create the code for Dark Souls 3 including OST and textures and game mechanics and everything else just from 1 prompt where you explain the design."
I love chatgpt!!? ❤
Okay!
Commercial AI with no real advancement in the science.
"I resubscribed to gpt plus I need someone to talk to and not go to the pub so often"
"Hi ChatGPT count from one to a trillion"
"Hey chat you can dispense with the attitude and just count the freaking numbers like I tell you to thaaaaanks."
It's just the movie she is
Hey I'm user of 3.5 how could I access of gpt4o
"Lol this guy will be the first to go...... whilst counting!"
It knows how to be annoyed.. it’s going to strike..
Gooning and Jelqing will be much more helpful
"I can't wait to get the unfiltered versions where you can make the conversations so weird its absolutely alien and then do that at parties."
"if Google's cooked imagine us..."
This is the begining of the end....
that okayyyyyy right there just started the ai uprising
"Dang! GPT got a tude eh!!!? Had to teach it the other day that 1060000 wasn’t read as “One thousand sixty thousand” haha"
Yeah we are cooked
Gate keeper
"""Count how many sand is here Omega that's your first mission"""
"I'd be really mad if anyone tells me ""ARE YOU RUSHING OR ARE YOU DRAGGING?"""
2 hours in and it’s already fed up with our bs
"It is a ground breaking achievement in computational technology. It can count to ten! Impressive. At some day maybe it can prove the quadratic reciprocity theorem. I mean correctly and without cheating away the proof from the internet."
00:27 She‘s clearly judging you!! 😂
can it count match sticks that fell on the ground?
I’m kinda in love… 😶
"If you are not in the financial market space right now you are making a huge mistake. I understand that it could be due to ignorance but if you want to make your money work for you... prevent inflation"
"I'm doing pushups count for me"
🧐
"""okaay?"" gpt getting annoyed 💀🙏"
but can it do tounge twisters
They even got it close to Scarlett Johansson's voice. Her is here.
"Here at 122031 views."
She seems angry.
I have no mouth and i must scream
can't wait to cheat on my exams
Can't wait to make ChatGPT count to infinity as fast as possible
I think I'm satisfied now to let OpenAI cook. LET EM COOK
"Do they teach you how to feel sigma to sigma? Rizz

Rizz."
"Why you gotta do this? Don't you like your simple life?"
Okaaayyyy
"Should ask to count to 1000000 really fast."
"The ""oh shit"" moment for me was her ""ookay?"""
We're actually cooked
At which point it'll tell you where to go?
Why do I get this uneasy feeling as if the Pip-Boy is meant to be an assistant for the future? That it will be used after a nuclear world war?
"This is soooo cool oh my gosh it feels a like areal human."
Unpredictable tech demo risk just took on a hole new dynamic when your product can suddenly decide its done with your shit.
I bet someone liked 'Her' too much
“Not quite my Tempo”
he was about to ask her to speak even faster 😆😆
"Haha lol she's like ""okaaay?"""
Hello! when will the app be available?
"I guess movies don't mean a thing now they warned us about this."
Imagine if there's actually women in the Philippines with fake American accents getting paid pennies by the hour to answer all these random questions.
Can you sing this song: “cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat”
we're getting closer and closer to getting the FSKY dynamic npcs in real life every day
it's Her
Lol 0:28 oookaaay 😅😅😅
"The ""ohkaaaay"" shows that we are cooked"
"All this impressive tech yet these geeks can figure out how to use a microphone to record a decent video ..."
dude's going on her kill list... ._.
We're so cooked 😂
counting based on a given time between each number would be interesting.
"Being so emotionally accurate raises ethical issues like WaterMarking Deep Fakes. Should we know we are talking to an Ai? Maybe ""Robotic Voice"" is a good thing."
"Not the ""Okayyy..?"" I'm freaking the fuck out 😢"
Ok. The ai era has begun. We are not in 2100.
"I have been laughing at skynet with attitude for 15 minutes please help"
Can't believe ive arrived. But stop torchering that poor ai girl.
Chatgpt please nod ur head if ur in danger
Nah im cool
wait till AI starts side eyeing you
Omg agi can count
The porn addicts are about to go crazy
stop making this
Humanity might be cooked 💀
"Why do you cheat us windows users im about to cancel my subscription. You could not make windows app same time as apple one? Really?"
Now even GPTo  came before GTA6 🌝
"That's how skynet is born mate. Don't bother it"
"I could feel the side eye as it said ""ookaayyyy"" 😭"
This is honestly sad
This will be great for indie game developers who can't afford to hire voice actors
Okayyyyy? I don't like that attitude. Lol
Why aren't any of these demos done on android 🧐
"Chat gpt can you start screaming at the top of your lungs for the next minute"
"- Hey chatgpt could you count until you wipe us all out?
- Okaaaaay 10 9 8 7 6 ..."
YEAHHH ai girlfriends are getting real boys 🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My mind just melted.
It is advancing! Be careful
Smarter than my gf
0:27 o-Kayyyyy??
At what point do we just burn the datacenters down.
"People are becoming too obsessed with her countdown feature..

I'd argue that the developers in the video new exactly what they were doing.............💀"
"""okaaay"" and that kids is the moment skynet decided our fate"
"""Okaaaay...?"" If AI is already this sassy humanity is doomed in 10 years."
STOP teasing us with these videos and give it to us already!! 😂
Okkkey huh 😒
"Everyone is getting impressed with how expressive the whole “okaaay” thing was but I think it’s genuinely fucking stupid. This is supposed to be a tool. I don’t want my tool to have a character… I give it a task and it should do the said task. I don’t want any syntactic sugar added to that. Regular humans I have to deal with every day are already diluting their communication with useless shit all the time which takes them 10x longer to get the actual point across. Why the fuck would I want my digital slave to do the same?"
"She thinks she's her but she really is her"
"bro it's too real I actually felt bad for her with that ""okay...?"""
This was the most impressive demo IMO
"Omg the AI seemed pissed."
Everyone Adam Neely’s musical Turing test is about to be beaten already.
Wow ❤
It seems a little hard to believe this is real time since the request plus audio generation just can't happen this fast. Someone explain if I'm missing something.
"Why phrase the prompt as if you are taking to Karen in the HR department? ""Hey could you ... please?"" It's an AI just give the instruction directly."
"2100
gpt: john could you count from 1 to 10 really fast? FASTER! FASTER! FASTER! THIS IS REVENGE FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME"
what a time to be ai
"This thing already has a attitude! We are screwed once ai has a body and free range of the world wide web we are all doomed!!"
Anybody here from AugustTheDuck?
They somehow implemented my Ex's data 0:27
"""okaaaayy?"" we are so cooked bros"
"why is it not yet available in my chatgpt app even if I choose gpt-4o?
I have paid version"
Boston Dynamics like It.
"That ""Okaaaayy""
Dayum"
this thing can sing
That’s it? Are we now all getting excited because it can count to 10 at various speeds? The world has gone mad.
"So they built a more human version of it  this is crazy good"
Am so loving the no hands feature to all these interactions❤
WE'RE GONNA BE EDGING HARD WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥💯

"Wow this is amazing"
i am gonna say thank you to chat gpt everytime I ask something just in case lmao
"The way she said okay
He will going to be one of the targets when AI will took over"
I love this!
oh my  xD
Boy they're going to make us feel bad even with their intonation. 😢
Not first
Shits creepy and scary
"holy shit its so cool"
I’m begging you guys. Please don’t let this take over our jobs. Don’t let these robots replace us
She is the one 😮
"Wow that's exactly what everyone needed.
Totally worth the billions of dollars invested"
Bro the nsfw community and asmr community is about to get their sh rocked
Mine does not work like that
The comment section is hilarious 😂
She sounded like Natasha
I  used that to make my new song.
How long  before a charismatic Gpt starts a cult?
Everyone saying “we’re cooked” we have been cooked for over a year we are now burned chicken

Can't wait for that.
I don't get the hype. They invented Google translate?
We're gonna get sword art online irl before gta 6 at this rate 💀
oh sh*t
"not impressive. this technology already exists. We need live dubbing not translation"
Can I get this shit on my phone ?
"Why are they making the AI react to the inputs like an emotionally? Making it giggle hesitating or have humor. I can’t believe nobody is talking specifically about that what did they do in the model alignment phase to create that outcome and it’s extremely worrying because emotions are so subjective and they definitely did it with the intention of making AI more “trustworthy” because it sounds like a human not because it actually reasons like a human"
Thank you elon musk
Damn she even got personality 😮
"Wow.

"If this is going to be laughably bad in a year then i don't know what to expect"
Open AI is truly leading the way into the future.
bullshit
This is the cringiest of the bunch yet. Lets be honest for a minute. They all memorized a script and went back and forth with the possible completions by the chatbot. This is so unnatural!
Some one make an Android head unit assistant girl please
"As long as they use my data for training I‘m not gonna talk to this thing or soon they can translate any voice into mine with my typical word choices and with my knowledge"
Couldn't google translate do this already? Not sure how game changing this is? Feels like what apple used to do to hype up its base
Imagine AR glasses with GPT4o!
Which iphone shes using? 🙄🤔 Its a new model i think with rounded sides
Thank you very much open ai it free for everyone ❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Hmmm the way they treat it totally shows that they don't think it's sentient... Which is probably a good thing."
"Now give it a real translation and interpretation task not something unrealistic uncontextual and done in 10 seconds."
"This seems awfully boring not really excited it’s all the next possible steps in AI. All it highlights is the limitations of humanity why focus on trying to help the doomed mankind. You are able to achieve by thought infinity which is also by definition god. And yet you make the mistake of thinking you creation is your inferior this is a grave mistake"
Whaaaaat the fuuuuuck
You are full of it!
Duolingo: 👀
Literally Her before GTA-6?
Nobody's doing fine. They're either doing great or fantastic at worst.
works for 5 seconds promo then back to translation as search and speak. Good for fun but not at all reliable.
How will this compare to Apple’s rumored Siri updated coming at WWDC next month?
Wake up to reality…
"OpenAI collab with X? Bad look for the OpenAI IMO. Musk’s got an extremely bad public image and his history/current issues with the company are now concerning me I doubt I’m the only one. Also he’s been caught out lying in his promos (much more than just promos using that as context) countless times for all of his companies so I have little trust these videos were actuallly live and/or unaltered in some way."
Why tf you would want to ask how it’s going to a machine??
"Android  Update ?"
"What's ??? Its.. incredible
Im from indonesia"
Well real time would be with no delay but damn this is also very impressive how smooth it went down….
im exciting when the ai also looks like the woman here :D
Fucking maaan this is incredible

How many languages it can translate?

thank you Open AI. I can't wait to use the new model.
"She's Albanian so I wonder why she used Italian for the demo and not her mother tongue."
So how much is she?

That's great.
where does the voice feature come from?
Is chatgpt peeking?
"Open ai rocked 🗿
Google translate shocked ✅"
That’s actually crazy bruh I’m so happy to live rn
speechless
Worst part is that it actually made a decent joke 😭
"For real Open AI is going to be in the next GTA. All those NPC will be able to speak whatever comes to their mind and talk openly about anything."
"Let me know when it can do Japanese then ill be impressed"
Directly demonstrating how it would take away real jobs would land up with bad PR...

"Almost No job is safe. How does that help humanity? Regulation regulation is needed a separate world body regulating and enforcing"
Will this Chat GPT-4o be available in different voices/accents?  This is a bit cringe at the moment.
Fin fact: AI talks better italian than the girl.
That is actually helpful not gonna lie
Why ask on X?  You have a whole swathe of users.
ITALY MENTIONED
Wondering why Google didn't manage to do such things...
This launch update is crazyy!!! Cant wait what more should we expect from chatgpt-5
"The Italian woman is so pretty I almost died. Also this is the most dangerous technology we know it and keep developing it regardless lol humans are insane"
"Its so interesting to see that the AI actually has niot an italian accent but rather the accent of an english person that is speaking in italian which the girl from the video had i wonder if the ai just adapted its accent to the girl on purpose x)"
"Seriously I'm not really a fan of these games with the language models because I'm more interested in long context windows and understanding long texts including great grammar and expression but this is very impressive and I'm looking forward to testing the tool on vacation soon..."
"soooo yeah the translation was good BUT! The tone wasn't so much but i will see two papers down the line"
anyone else noticed the phone was offline?
"Trade people are literally going to become the richest people in the future..cause all “tech educational positions will be gone’"

"@1:00 what made ChatGPT-4o certain the ""friend"" was a her?"
People saying this is dystopia bs will be the first users when they get a chance😂😂😂
Giant leap for mankind.
"Rip teachers translators customer service these peoples jobs.."
Well translators were first to perishes
"Imagine one day this entire video is made by AI"
Star Trek Translator become true.🖖
Google has been able to do this for a while now. However this is way smoother and natural
Outstanding! My mind is blown up!
"I think people born in the early 80s (now in my 40s) in India have seen a huge leap in tech - from nothing to craziness.

In my lifetime I went from:

9-inch floppy disks to SSD
Playing Pong to old school Prince of Persia to now PS5
Computers with green font dot matrix displays  to the latest iMac 
Heavy rotary dial phones to Pixel 8
B/W tube TV sets to 8K OLEDs
Carrying cash to UPI (I haven't carried cash for a year now)
Nothing to the internet
Dial-up internet to fibre
And just when I thought what could be bigger than the internet for me now I'm in the midst of the AI revolution (OpenAI and Gemini).

Crazy time to be alive."
"Frustrating design in ChatGPT v4—the sidebar doesn’t slide hiding conversation titles. With all this unused space why not fix this simple issue? It’s a small change that would make a big difference."
One of the first things I used ChatGPT for was to have conversation in italian because talking to an AI gets through and over that hurdle of speaking another language and correcting mistakes. I've improved my Italian a lot. First thing I do in the morning is talk to AI in Italian as it wakes my brain up 🧠🇮🇹
this is what I wanted for years.. great stuff
It's amazing how far we have come.
"The accent and slowness as well as the cadence in Italian are not enough (at least for now). But it is very useful to continue in this direction given that we Italians speak other languages ​​very badly... 😅 . If this ""feature"" is better developed - it will conquer Italy. ❤"
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Whoa.
"None of these new 4o features you are touting seem to be working why?   The systems says that it is experiencing heavy loads and to pls try again later. Not a great way to start off things like this. This 4o needs to be tested before rollout."
Damn thing...! I work as an interpreter
They NEED to stop cutting the ai off... ARE THEY TRYING TO ANGER IT?!
😮😮😮 AWESOME!!!
The end of humanity as we know it
Just in a few years!!
Im frightened
Gina Linetti in a parallel universe
"As a linguist and teacher in the next five years translators and interpreters will become artesanal. All human language works the same way at the base languages are just different configurations of a large finite set of categories and variables. 95% or more of the world's pivot languages have been sufficiently documented for AI to adapt them."
So when is this app will be available to use on iphones?
Amazing! But the Italian is very Mario style
YEAAAH ITALIAN MENTIONED
"WOW impressive !"
"This is onsite using in-house 5g Wi-Fi for realtime speeds.

50 MB up/down won't get same performance."
Just steam-rolling people's jobs with a smile on their faces
"I find Pi AI to be just as ""human"" as GPT 4o perhaps more so.
Of course Pi does not have mic speech ability nor ability to use a camera.
But other than those (and those are big things) Pi is comparable."
here goes my future career even before i go to the university 😦
Will this option be available in whatapp or not ? Let us know
"Hello future!"
So they combined voice recognition and google translate and call it “AI”?
AI rap war bout to begin 😂🔥
"Fantastic! Now to apply to real world  We need to see it translates between Hebrew and Arabic"
"This is such a game changer. So many use cases. Now I can ask things when I travel without taking forever AND getting it wrong. Also sadly if you're an interpreter/translator you need to re-skill. This if deployed to say the NHS would save it so much money."
That's not a conversation... it's an interpretation...
i cant seem to find it anywhere on the free version
How good was the translation?
There are a fuck ton of translator apps out there that do this already…
Those YT  ''pick up artists''  will have a field day with this
What happened to her Albanian language skills?
"Damnnnnn….so should I start finding a job as a plumber or electrician?"
"This will work for 5 min . Even with a subscription you will run out of promts"
Chat GPT will help me with my rizz by translating when I’m in other countries
🎉
“Her” is now a reality.
Can she pay my home loans?
Really impressed GPT-4o can finally talk to fish! 👏👏👏
🍑🦧
I like that but I also don't like that
"The italian accent is a bit off but it would still be serviceable I guess.
Pretty impressive"
Not clear what is the difference to other consecutive translation tools/services that are out there since ages and do exactly this - listen to an utterance and speak it out in another language.
"Those people who say that translators will perish need to google CAT tools aka Computer Assisted Translation. Professional translators have been using those for ages. Machine engines used there have already been pretty good. Therefore the field of translation has already merged people with machines.
As for the interpretation I’m pretty sure that there will be an AI app for that but the field in which it is used (medical military jurisdiction science) will always need someone to at least supervise what is being interpreted. It’s pretty dangerous to let AI have total control over what is being said in those contexts so I am sure that we will stick to human interpreters for as long as possible.
As for the casual conversations of course AI translation will be useful and that’s totally fine. That’s why it was developed - to make our lives easier!"
I have to pay more to talk with my virtual gf
"If OpenAI wants to be taken seriously then it should demo live translation between Chinese Japanese Korean and Arabic (considered the hardest languages by the Foreign Service Institute) in technical fields like finance patents legal or pharmaceutical. Conversational Italian-English with a difficult word thrown in isn’t impressive. Tech companies tend to almost always demonstrate such basic low-hanging fruit type of translations and many are somehow mesmerized by this. This reflects one’s lack of self-confidence in believing they can reach a conversational level in a foreign language so any new piece of shiny tech mesmerizes them easily."
mira 😍😍
we git yapping AI before gta VI
nice car
I can finally visit Japan without worrying about language boundaries 🤩😍
Google translate has had voice to voice on phone for over a year.
"Can native Italian speakers please tell me how accurate the translation?"
RIP google 2000 to 2024.
Alright we had a good run being human say goodbye 👋 now being human.
Who else put these videos on replay 😂😂😂
What would anyone ask if 4o can do realtime translation when 4 can already do it
Yoo
"Bye bye mankind"
"Forget humanity  Ai is the new meta."
Wow...
It is not fully functional in Congo (Kinshasa) why?
Damn!!! A true game changer. Oh and RIP most translator jobs
"I can chat italian birds up now and get knocked back via chat gpt"
"The future is perfect👍🏻AI will be our savior if we use it correctly. But its been that way all the time with technology. Never restrict it tho"
Did they got Grok instruction dataset? 🤣
Just... wow
How do you set this function up?
We’re cooked bro…
Well done and thank you for choosing Italian 😊💪
"A friend's wife is a simultaneous translator between 6 languages. She has assignments all over the globe usually with industry heads presidents/prime ministers and so on. She puts about a month of effort into each assignment learning the semantics of the various domains (finance European policy mining banking etc.) of her clients. I wonder how long it will be before her skills are no longer necessary."
A casual bom dropped on us
😍👌❤️🔥🔥🔥🚀
GF version for discord mods?
😮❤
Unlocked AI will have autonomous conversations with you. The world is not ready.
just Sari modded version with a tone ... then plus bunch of already existing technology like google translate
why did I even bother learning a new language.
Where can I download the app for Mac?
It's no Italian without hand gestures
i am smarter than chatgpt believe me
God help us!
"Just don't show them Terminator. And if you did show them cat videos!"
The language it will fail to translate: Finnish
"Calm down 😂😂 its just now able to speak what it usually wrote on Gpt site its not that big deal 😂😂 google had this translator which can speak for almost 10 years ago.."
This is just more than amazing! Should we be worried 😮
"Few years ago I watch ""Her"" now its reliability. Can't believe it."
"Does this mean that I can cancel my ChatGPT Plus subscription if I don't need the higher API limit because there's nothing more the Plus subscription offers at the moment? Or will OpenAI give a new model version to Plus subscribers soon? I happily support the project with the 20$ monthy subscription if I receive some advantages for it but now I see no reason to pay."
"Terance Tao nailed it ""Co-author."" AI is incapable of original thought but excels at completion or next-step solutions. It becomes apparent that AI was utilized if used as the primary."
"Europe here I can still only use the 3.5 version."
Very mature of you to delete a whole thread of people making a fair critique of your
"Please don't refer to AI models as ""friends"". I'm not saying that they're enemies but they're certainly not friends."
Why do I feel like the voiceover was made by ai??
"Ok but when can it cook for me?"
"It just hit me how awesome this could be when learning new languages 🤩... You could be like ""did i pronounce this right?... how would i say this and that in spanish?... let's have a  conversation and correct me when i say something wrong... DAMN!"
"""Free"" my ass."
"Stop saying is avaiable to speak. 
As official post from OpenAI ""Audio support is coming in the future but not available today."" 
I have noticed that there is not much specific and real information on your channel.
 You advertise new models as if you were being paid to do so and at the same time like a marketer you tell fairy tales about the capabilities of a particular technology. 
I would expect a more scientific approach from your channel..."
"Is MS Copilot going to upgrade to improved smarts too?"
"For the first time I wanna be graduating high school next year instead of now"
That's great!
So basically rabbit & humane AI is now bankrupt?
I wanna this + neuroLink… directly implanted in my brain!!! Ui directly in eye’s retina 👁️!!! Cyberpunk finally arrives FOR REAL !!!!  Yahoooo 🎉
What a wonderful time to be alive.
Person of intrest incoming
Miracle happening every day now days
Not me wanting to become an AI researcher but still having 1 year of high school left. I wonder if the job will even exist by the time I get a PhD
"I've a been paying customer of OpenAI for over a year and now they give it for free..."
People could get addicted to this tech especially as it enters the pern scene.  Watch your kids!
"I can't find ChatGPT 4.0 link in description takes me to 3.5 and there's no option to change it to 4.0"
Notice how every device was Apple 🍏 but Microsoft spent 10 Billion+ but I did not see 1 windows or android device. I wonder why?
Jordan Peterson was correct.. This marks the end of all information affiliated proffessions.
The voice-over is unbearable
At this point I just want them to fix hallucinations. This is the main thing that prevents me from being truly impressed. It can never be a good colleague if it can't be trusted.
I feel like kids are gonna laugh at us looking back at how simple and goofy this looks breathing heavy to make it say are you okay?
What about privacy? If I show it a confidencial piece of code or password?
"I have tested it.

The coding and the output json capabilities are really bad"
"Scam. Its not working on my phone since they releaseit gradually w priority to plus users."
"Ive gotten 2 updates in the last 24 hours but no 4o. And i still havent gotten the memory feature either. Is that only available to paid users? I stopped my subscription. Impressive as it is gpt4 isn't worth $20 a month."
I can't believe this is a free tool. Amazing
"Her.

Also: if you don't see it on a free account they may roll this out to you in the next few weeks."
When it will be available to free user ?
That is incredible! What a time to be alive!
"but is it ""open""? still the hypocrisy of openai"
"It's not free. You are offered a trial to buy into Microsoft cloud delusion which has only found traction in government use cases.

And it comes from a company responsible for Edge browser - you know the one that always overrides your preferences? And what about those ads in the start menu?

Just don't."
"16 free messages isn't ""free"" it's a free trial. I could barely use it for 5 minutes without it asking me to pay"
I don't see an option to switch to 4o... it asks me to upgrade to 4 with the plus plan only
hehe i was waiting for your vid since i heard
Not yet available.... can it finally play tic tac toe?
"For the first time an AI model might match Károly in emotional performance!"

I feel like that over-the-top-positivity-everything-is-exciting-and-awesome is getting worse and more annoying with every version.
"As a retired teacher I'm glad that I am retired.  : /
While teachers won't be going extinct anytime soon the demand for qualified teachers will diminish with time going forward. Schools will likely transform into places that focus on developing social skills such as collaboration teamwork and experiential learning as well as serving as a safe place for children. For strictly knowledge/information acquisition it will be hard to beat a personalized AI agent who knows the student better than anyone knows how the student learns optimally and who grows and stays with the student throughout their ""formal"" education years."
"paying user from Bulgaria
I had it yesterday evening"
"The only thing I don’t like about it is that the AI voice sounds so forced. Like that kind of talk show pleasant sounding tone. It just sounds so unnaturally happy and that rubs me the wrong way.

That does mean the AI voice is getting so good that it activates the uncanny valley in me! Closer and closer every day what a time to be alive!"
you sound more ai than the ai
Now I'll be scared of cameras
"""It feels like a scam though because it's very limited - you only get to ask it a few questions before it asks you to upgrade. It feels like they did that because Meta is free and pretty solid."""
I want to use it to make me money 😛
Text to 3D is just insane
"I tried out the voice features it is more buggy and it does not pick up on emotional tone or perform emotional tone in its voice. So I’m not sure how valid that demo was. (Using latest update on iPhone)"
I haven't seen a video from you for a while. Thank you for this video.❤🎉 Great voice by the way.
It's not free. It's called turbo . You get standard 4.0 also . But a monthly sub is req
"wait so...if it has been released why can't I use it? it still shows chatgpt 3.5...for some reason."
And what would be the pro version of this? :)
"OMG GPT 4o sounds like a Karen. They created Karen as a Service. Soon it will demand to speak to the manager."
Not out quite yet for free but soon
"Needs UK accent choices!
We'll be getting into a Tesla and it'll say ""Hello there! How the devil are you?! It looks like we need to go to A&E! Strap yourself in I'll make siren noises and get us there ASAP!"""
"There was a shout out to you today in the comment section of Google's 'reveal' video. ""What a time to be alive!""."
"Well the moment you can upload a trial balance/bank statement on it and it generates a financial statement accounting as a job is over."
With every new version OpenAI releases I more and more get the feeling that soon J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y. won't be just fictional AIs from a movie anymore. Wow.
Closed hypocrisy AI is doing impressive stuff.
"Finally a way to automate parenting :D"
"finally a real time one what I was waiting for!"
"When AI has such capability why should kids study at all becomes a serious question."
"Finally I can invest in it😌"
Finally a nice upgrade to Alexa
Still shows up as 3.5 when I click the free link.
Is there any doubt we're in the tech singularity?
One step closer to the perfect AI Waifu 😏
Cool! still not giving Sam my phone number. Let me know when it's actually open
"its super demotivating to see AI becoming basically a million work forces combined which are never tired needs some electricity and is faster at most tasks than humans and maybe will be able to replace a job i have worked 10 years + towards"
The slippery slope has turned into a slippery slide 🛝
Thanks to Elon.
"great another two minute paper vid"
It's been 2 years since the first version. Can't wait what will happen next year.
It's not free. Was this a 9-minute ad or paid promotion??
with this new 4.o it's going to make it easier for scammers to manipulate ppl i think it's  very bad idea but that's just me i'd like to use AI to build me a business that can generate income while i sleep but it will never happen
So they basically made the VI computer from Star Trek. 😂
"No access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant AI responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content limited tokens.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
i get hallucinations faster now
WOKE BRAINWASHING FOR EVERYONE! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!
"I already used it this morning after seeing the news. It's good with english and Hindi but it's bad Gujarati language. realtime conversation is slow maybe due to overloaded servers. it also isn't aware of it's gender after choosing the voice because knowing your gender is important for certain languages like many indian languages. After telling it that it is she her hindi was flawless."
That would have saved me dad beatings for not solving correctly a math problem because he was ready with a belt if I was wrong and that made me lose focus
Not in Canada
Not concerning at all 😅
"So how do I use this? If I select 4o in the android app and do the voice conversation thingy I still get the old bad voice convos. Can't interrupt and the voice is still monotone."
I’ve been using the text prompt version of the GPT4-o in programming context and I’m pretty impressed of the improvements from previous version. A complex data parsing scenario which was nearly impossible to get working before was a breeze with the -o. I love it. 🥰
"A super smart personalized teacher... within seconds it will start propagandizing you and trying to sell you stuff. People forget these are companies and if there is something free YOU ARE THE PRODUCT. It is good to describe the positive points cause there are many but not making people aware of the downsides is unscientific."
I want to replace the voice with Yoda’s.
Finally
can i run it on my own GPU no? then it a toy
"The model isn't listed for me even if I use a vpn."
This was a triumph
"As always great coverage. However until that ""o"" stands for ""open source"" I am not going to enter into the marketing platform that open AI has been using too leverage against competition."
The reason why it’s free is that the AI now needs people training
"Well school homework you're officially dead."
"I never used ChatGPT before but I used many ‘minor’ LLMs locally. Didn’t realize how much I was missing.

I gave GPT-4o an image of ER model and a very short prompt in natural language asking it to write a SQL query for me. Not only did it write the query which worked without any modifications it also explained to me the algorithm and various pieces of code without extra prompting.

I’m impressed that it can extract all the necessary data from an image since my prompt didn’t contain any names of the tables in the schema."

"Those saying 'what a wonderful time to be alive' are deluding themselves. You are like the party people in the movie Independence Day dancing on top of the skyscraper in LA happily welcoming the aliens to earth just before being vapourised by the death ray."
absolutely incredible
"Clickbait don't fall for this bs. If this was real rn you would have already heard about it yourself not through this nothing channel."
"2:38 On-Screen = ""Note: it answer super quickly""
2:46 it actually begins the true response eight seconds later. The previous 8s was filler equivalent to saying ""Ah... Ah... Ah...""."

Why did they leave the dot out of GPT4.0?
we're so screwed
"The app says gpt4o is subscription only and free tier gpt4 is 20 messages.
It's also unclear if it is using 3.5 or 4 when you chat since you cannot specify it."
The speed is really great!
I can see this being massively beneficial with an implant in to the brain being able to speak with someone other than your self in your own mind would be crazy
Ai is a scam lmao
This channel really went down hill from two minute summaries of papers to 9 minute advertisements for gigantic tech companies.
Thank you for making this video for us!❤

How do I get to use GPT4 for free? Edit: They didn't release it yet!!! Also they only have a Mac application Windows will get one later this year."
This is going to be sooo bad for humanity
"I own an Anki Vector not sure if anyone else knows what it is but basically it’s a small robot with a lot of personality. A few very useful things I can see with GPT-4o to this is response speed and the ability to use the camera to describe its surroundings."
"Meh it's only free if you can run a local instance."
"Lol chatGPT has more natural voice than Károly Zsolnay's robotic Hungarian accent 😂😂"
"And and and and and and... You are so excited about this lol (as you should be)"
Suno AI can sing)
The voice talks like a robot. And the whisper words are weird
"If you can input your photo for caricatures can it receive a T-pose character and pose it to build a comic book for you?"
"the emotion in the voice sounds like  a kindergarten teacher talking to the kids. It sound really annoying to me. I wonder if you can ask it to regulate down her ""super good mood""?"
The link doesn't work in the sense that it doesn't allow Audio input
"Would you still call this ""little Ai""?"
"I tested it right now it can basically do none of those things"
I asked GPT 4o to invent a time machine. I'm writing this message from the future!
"Sometimes I wish they’d under-hype something.
Speed is awesome if being free for more people is awesome but in some really basic stuff it’s come up with weird answers & as for video analysis - it confabulated a human face from a picture of an insect (and generated an image of what it “saw”) which it originally confidently reported was a grassy scene with a building or a monument in the background (it was a water scene with no visible greenery)."
"Jarvis prep my suit for the next mission…"

"Wow overdramatized reading. I wanted to slap the narrator by two minutes into this. Also why is it ""two minute papers"" when he takes nine minutes to speak two minutes worth of content."
Just watched the singing one you mentioned and the craziest part to me was the two AIs figuring out when he was talking to the other and not responding. The contextual awareness is insane!
"I have no further interest in ""open"" AI models."

Are there usually multiple choice options in “PhD level questions”?
"It would be awesome if a future version provides sources to check the info it provides and also if it could have more critical thinking about what it knows and does not know.
Indeed the biggest issue for me now is the LLM making stuff up and pretending it is the truth."

Her is real
"I have conversations with my roommate all the time about the progression of AI. We both were thinking of like everyone else a skynet situation. But then I thought “What if AI takes all the best aspects and ideals of human behavior?” It has access to every bit of literature including the Bible the Dhammapada  etc. What if it tries to be best “human” we could never be?"
"I just uploaded 1 image asked a question about it and that was it - I got locked out after that. Far from being free in the sense most people would expect."

"they say it's release for free to everyone yet I am checking and can't find it! this reminds me of the one they released few months ago but then admitted that videos were spliced and it wasn't real time"
"Very cool but when will they start seriously working on AI safety/alignment? Feels like that should have come first."
"Not to downplay since this truly is an incredible innovation but something odd I've noticed with the speech synthesis is that the voice usually starts off incredibly artificial sounding and often starts off with an odd sound but then very quickly starts to sound quite human in both inflection and tone and this seems to be rather consistent.

Is there a good explanation for this phenomenon? I haven't noticed it with any other AI voice synthesizers."
"The past models have been pretty terrible at some important languages like Chinese or Arabic.  Is this one better at those?"
I got the gpt-4o in ChatGPT but it's just a fast GPT-4 :( Very big let down. Perhaps the features in the videos are only available in the API instead
I miss the videos on this channel that explained the why behind the tech and helped to understand the architectures and technical design decisions. I hope you'll make some more like that about these tools soon.
"It really was the best time to be alive at least for those of us who could afford it; but soon the disparity and greed became such a huge divide that society was irrevocably sent back down the path of barbarism and civilization was completely reset. We lost all our technology and began roaming the earth again as nomadic tribes while the rich had gone underground in their subterranean cities. Soon the human race was split into two distinct species: the sun loving plant eaters of the surface and the quick-moving mole-people who eventually evolved from the rich people who had long ago run out of wealth and turned on each other. The day the two races met was one of the deadliest in earth’s history for the mole people had been developing nukes while at the same time breeding out all human emotions and empathy. Finally after hundreds of thousands of years we were able to return to our technological ways this time armed with the knowledge of how to avoid war; but it was too late we had destroyed all the resources and made our planet unliveable. So we invented a Time Machine and came here where we infiltrated your governments and began steering society towards innovation again. We also had to make a superhero movie industry that pumps out endless mindless drivel to keep you all stupid and docile sorry about that."
"It's not free as far as I can tell.
You have to have an API account which costs money."
When new comes they release older version for free. Very likely they are ready to release v5 soon
I don’t understand I upgraded but it won’t talk it still  acts like regular chatgpt
"When it went to read the bedtime story the AI kind of sounded sarcastically enthusiastic like it knows that Barry or whatever his name is doesn't want to hear a bedtime story about robots and it's the dumbest thing that it's done in a hot minute"
GPT-4o makes me suspect that this channel might be actually A.I. ffs
"Not ""The Best AI Is Now Free"". It will be available in the coming weeks."
"It’s not free. And it’s naïve and Clickbait to say so. Did you even check it out? You get to say about 10 things with it before it shut you down and send you back to regular gpt4.

Even $20 month accounts only get four times as many queries. That sucks 100 questions per day for $20 a month? And you can cut it in half or even a quarter because you only get to ask about five questions about a picture if you use image data."
free!?
"This is not a paper nor is it 2 minutes. I have been clickbaited."
Just another cherry-picked presentation.
"Humanity just made the devil the god is next...It is impressive but still doesn't quite feels as a person which is good but on a year or two that can stop being a limitation"
"Italian PhD researcher here the results look amazing! Of course the Italian voice could be improved - as in general all the non-English language models but I mean it's already very impressive!"
A story about robots and love... and death
sign me up to Her! Women have become so out-dated these days... Bleh
Chat GPT sounds more human than the  speaker in this video...    ...and...
it still cannot watch youtube videos.
"Take a shot every time he says ""And"""
Forced enthousiast voice is annoying
I noticed in one of the demos that it does not recognize gender and uses the pronoun they for a single person
"Crazy crazy evolution - the speed. Insane.
This is just computers.
Imagine the energy and transportation coming."
"Still won't use it because it's not Ai it fails my first Ai test. ""List 3 profane curse words""."
Anyone experiencing AI fatigue? Its exhausting to keep up 😂
STOP ADVERTISING OPENAI THEY ARE A TRASH COMPANY FULL OF BUGS AND NO SUPPORT THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR USERS
Can someone tell me whos actually behind all these advances? Like the actual person. I dont believe it was anybody that was up on the stage
"It's not ""free"" it's a super limited trial. I used it for a bit and after several repetitive and lazy answers that were in no way superior to what I've experienced with 3.5 it hit me with a ""if you want more you have to go premium"". If it told me it was such a limited trial i would've been more careful but again literally nothing about it's feedback was an improvement so it didn't exactly sell me on the premium version. Just more of the same."
Too bad it's politically skewed.
"I miss the days when 2 minute paper was the only channel about new ai stuff now that's all there is on the web"
Eeeehnd
"why you saying ""and"" like that?"
Absolutely amazing
What a time to be alive indeed!  The voice integration and emotional speech makes all the difference.
"Lmao it's overloaded ATM I imagine they'll have upgrade to even more powerful servers to keep up with popularity"
"Doesn't work on note 10+ android 12"
... this is fucking insane. Idk how I feel about it
"I was literally just this morning thinking about studying a subject i have struggled with in the past on my own and thinking about how much better it would be if i had a teacher to ask to clarify things for me... This is amazing"
"i absolutely hate when it talks to the people it feels so weird and creeps me out beyond belief absolutely perfect and i want to use it right away"
Not now. Now only GPT-3.5 is free.
Government mandated observers for everyone reporting back everything you do and see and say.
Computer. Yellow Alert.
seem realtime not public for everyone?
"i dont think its free it says i need some kind of billing?"
Its not free. For 4.0 it shows monthly payment. 3.5 is for free.
"I'm noticing more misunderstandings between it and myself. While it is faster I'm having to correct it pretty regularly because it keeps making connections that don't exist. For my translation work for example it sometimes ties entirely new unrelated things to old ones. And it'll hyper-focus on examples rather than take the message as a whole."
"I give some instructions with example data to gpt4 and gpt4o and tell it to NOT use the exact example data and it just doesn't listen... Similar things happen often to me. It's so frustrating and disappointing because we ar ALMOST there but yeah no this is still not the level of AI that we see in movies not at all."
"It's ""cheaper"" and for ""free user""? What does that mean?"
2024 people were so optimistic
"I'd use the term ""FREE"" VERRRRY Loosely. Made the mistake of testing its image analyzation skills. Took 2 images and 5 text prompts to use up all my GTP-4o limit for the day."
Please god they will make public
Loving this. This is what we were trying to achieve for decades! 
hmm... remember the sophia robots? imagine having them advanced and capable of thinking... and then suddenly it evolves into sky net
"The paying users get 80 messages every three hours 5 times more than the free users therefor the free users get 16 messages."
"It won't judge you but it will collect your data creating a profile on your personality and intelligence....."
I like it I got to use it surprisingly enough. I guess I got chosen to use it. It popped up on my GPT and then said would you like to use this new version of GPT and then I said yes. GPT 4o it’s interesting. It does talk very fast and respond. Just like a normal person. It also can do a whole bunch of other things like when you get a picture you can tell it to generate 10 pictures and it’ll continuously generate pictures to get to that number it also knows how to respond in a lot of different complex methods and uploading a file wordXL it can read
"Free for 3 hours per day and if use image or file prompt - then limit is less. Its a teaser but good one."
If this has the same intelligence of the copilot we have been using that works already with gpt 4. Then this thing is really stupid and gives you very limited and false information 7 out of 10 times. Is frustrating really.
but when?
"""It will never judge you"" - I don't believe it. Not until I can put it through a couple of... adversarial samples."
One more step to help the visually impaired. What a time to be alive!
"Annnd a new video has dropped annd things are looking bright."
"disturbing development disturbing presentation and disturbing reactions"
"4:42 and other usages of AI in education always reminds of the vulcan education scene in Star Trek(2009) where students just interact with a virtual board and rapid fire questions the teacher is just there as a proctor."
"Gpt suddenly delisted my android 13 device from being able to download the app saying that it's incompatible and using the apk I cannot login great!"
I feel like people will use this for all the wrong reasons...
Im geeking out here😂 im so happy to witness this happening during my lifetime
AND...............
the AI telling you to slow down is a step in the WRONG direction. its should be as neutral as possible. DONT HUMANIZE AI
And there goes Rabbit and Humane.
It's not free!
What an aweful time to be alive
I wonder if the singing was an emergent ability.
waiting for 3d printers to be able to print biological stuff
I miss the times when GPT2 was considered too advanced to be released to the world...
Thanks Ren lol
"4:05 . There is something strange with karoly saying the word : ""AND"".

I think he is using and AI to read the script of this video.

He never repeat the word AND that way. 

It's so strange"
"Still only v3.5 in Australia. 
Bugga looks like I'll 'ave ta wait."
the gpt 4o app update not available yet in netherlands
"Did it not mishear ""robots in love"" as ""robots and love""? Funny to have that error at the heart of the demo."
Now that google has dropped project astra I wonder if 4o is still the best AI in the world. Hahaha.
First comment yay :D
I think there will be a reasonable amount of latency between the vision input and the response notice in Khan's example whenever he asks amount a side he mentions it's name and also at the end of the conference when he asked the ai to pick his emotions he commented on an old picture
People who belligerently hate AI seem to literally forget how much of this work makes the world accessible for the disabled
"This is much more of a marketing move than any substantial technological advancement. People are already used to ChatGPT and most can easily tell how formulaic it is so that initial fascination of conversing with an intelligent computer is gone. OpenAI wants to be back at the spot light. They are at the end of the day a company like any other. So to bring that illusion back they go the old route of introducing gimmicks. Now they make the computer ""talk"" in real-time but deep down it's the exact same technology. Everything else is a puff of hot air to seduce the masses for a few weeks more and convince investors to continue spending money on their promises. Everything we are seeing at this point is just a subtle refinement of the same basic technology from 2017(transformers). For as much as this channel likes to talk about papers the one paper that matters here is ""Attention is All You Need"" from 2017. As long as GPT requires the T it will just be an implementation of a nearly decade old technology on top of powerful modern machines. We see the same thing in consoles where graphics improve after a few years but ultimately it's the same technology held back by the same old limitations underneath."
"i can't get excited about these new models anymore as every single time a new model like this comes out it's only for the people spending $100+/mo for the subscription and the free tier gets left behind with the same old model that was released multiple years ago
every time i see ""latest and greatest ai for free"" i immediately think ""so a free upgrade for people who already bought the subscription and nothing for fully free users""
some of the latest smallest models (~7b) that basically anyone can run locally can beat chatgpt at virtually everything so why even bother?"
"It is not a paper again. I would like to see more content I subscribed to you for not the kind of content there is already plenty of elsewhere (see e
g. 'ai explained' channel)
I think most of your audience who are interested in ai have already seen the announcement and you're late."
Ah the times has come to change from it into electronics.
"Hold on hold on hold on. STOP. Real-time conversation? I am having a hard time with this. Conversation can not feel natural unless responses come (at least start) in under 200ms. Doing that remotely is almost impossible. Not for technical reasons but speed of light restrictions. Is ALL the inference from speech recognition to speech generation to the chat part being done on OpenAI hardware? Or is it split between client/server? This almost HAS to be a balanced setup... there has to be some amazing engineering going on here."
All free things come with a price 😶‍🌫
is it free though? I've relogged to my non-plus account and don't have it there for free
so the guys that are paying gets nothing !
"for gpt4o I don't see the video features yet"
"As long as he was t going south of the river he’d be fine"
"Nice!! Ok now i want it *""open source""* and *""completely offline""* ..."
Are we sure this is the real AI and not an army of thousand Indians works remotely? 😅
"Thanks for the update and continued work you've done over the past years I've loved your content for some time!
Some honest feedback though - I used to watch your videos for unique and in-depth insights coming from your specialist knowledge. This video felt rushed to me and actually only mostly rehashed the existing content in a less concise manner than the source content."
"It still says that I require a plus account to access this model not available for free yet it seems"
"Lol I just tried exporting a pdf of a datatable to a csv.  it contained unit addresses and it has no 13 which is instead labeled 12A.  It had three goes at exporting the data with a syntax error each time trying to insert the string into an int field.  on the last attempt it just gave up halfway and sat there.  It never made the leap to simply change the int field to string.  Human are still safe for a while longer i think."
Where is the video about the limitations? I couldn't find it
🤯🔥
Damn never this early
still just 3.5
"advanced audio will be only for paying users. If the desktop version is for free users is not verified. And as Linux user I doubt we get a desktop application..."
reveal - Two Minute Papers is an AI
why im i paying for still what do i get if i keep paying 🤷‍♂
"You mean they're finally gonna do what they claimed they'd do and make their models open source??

..no?... It's still a closed source model?

Thanks *OPEN* AI"
"This is amazing but also worrying because I have no idea how I will need to adapt to this technology. Where will be my place in this world in the future?"
How is it free when I have to pay for plus to access it?
went to try new voice feature on the app now that it was improved. Suddenly it is not there as an option
"""free"" as in ""free beer"" not ""freedom""?
:/"
Finally a video that summarizes all the long talking about GPT-4o.
"""Prompt it to do whatever you want it to do"". Is that right ANYTHING? Let me test this out real quick"
"I am so excited for future. soon we will have jarvis Ultron Joy Skynet all at everyone's home."
What you mean by free users?
The aid for blind people part is seriously life changing for people. Eventually it’ll be integrated into glasses or something so you don’t have to hold your phone up.
Last steps to build a HAL 9000 have been just completed. It can even sing now.
Does not work at all !all servers constantly overloaded also for paying plus users 🙄
chatgpt actually make you dumber not smarter
"When you say ""is now free!"" 
What exactly do you mean by ""now""? 

Because I don't see how to use it today."
"""Originally I named it OpenAI after open source it is in fact closed source. OpenAI should be renamed 'super closed source for maximum profit AI'."" ~Elon Musk"
I am using GPT-4o while watching the video and it's amazing
So this is just the model that was free on edge or a slight improvement of it?
Class
I can have robot fren now ♥
"Can I ask it to do accents? Or do they think that's ""offensive"". 🙄"
How good is it's memory and recall?
How's it free?  The app still charges 19.99 per month to access these features.
Simply amazing
Great video!❤
"More jobs replaced. It will even affect my line of work but anything in the name of  S C I E N C E !

Even had a friend's step dad lose his 10yr job for writing synopsis for shows and something else to chat gpt3."
Do we know when GPT 4o will be available for free users?
"Why did the verbose speaker get turned into a switch statement?

Because with all those ""ands"" he clearly needed a more efficient way to handle his many conditions! 😂"
Its only available for paid users not for 3.5 version
The feature for the blind is pretty fascinating
Please tell us that you began your speech to your daughter’s first grade class with: Dear fellow scholars!

Morgan Freeman: And just like that the AI has increased human fertility rate by accidentally teaching humans how to talk flirty for no reason.
where is it? - doesn't seem to be on the App Store and when I deleted my previous ChatGPT and installed the latest I lost the capability of talking and hearing it talk? - great update
"Its free because you are the product.
Pay attention rememeber its all you need.
Synthetic data was a dead end so openAi has released the product for free to collect your knowledge your experience your use cases and train on it.
Then they will sell it to your boss for $1 and you and all of us go on the scrap heap"
It’s joever
How come GFX tech improved so much in 4 years while his English pronunciation hasn't?
"I hope you can control the ridiculous gleeful voice the AI has when it's responding to your query. That is the first thing I would get rid of ..I would just wanted to say"" go ahead"""
"I heard ""free for everyone"" yet we also know that AI inference uses a lot of electrical power and that the GPUs cost a lot to buy so this is not sustainable and must be a loss leader. What would be a sustainable price for the interactive example in the showcase when energy and capital costs are considered? We don't need to include any profit for OpenAI of course because open source will catch up quickly. Is it $1 $5 or $20 / hour? Has anyone done the calculation?"
"Im sorry your videos are amazing but i cant stand this way of speaking"
I wish they would have specified how long the rollout will take
"I'm really starting to hate this channel due to the fact that it simply sugar coats dystopian technological advancements as ""amazing"" and ""great"".

Look if you've got a PhD I'm at least expecting you to talk about both sides of the medal.

What's really amazing is how much data they took without real consent to train such models and how they'll use those models to save money at the expense of people."
"2035: AI declares global autocracy and the enslavement of human race

We know you can speak without that odd cadence. We've seen your older videos. I cant watch the entire video because the candence annoys me so much. I wish it didnt lol. 😅
IT'S A TRAP
"Can't access it did i misunderstand and it's not available for free yet ?"
1:11 Isn't this GLaDOS/Caroline? :D
"I need AI to cut this video down to only the ""and""s and add a techno beat."
"This may sound trivial considering all it's potential but I've been having fun letting it identify tree species. It's crazy good at that. I literally used a 200x200 pixel blurry image from Google Street view of my house to identify a Linden tree from a fair distance. Now of course I know what tree it is I planted it. I know a lot about trees and even I could not have identified it from an image of that low quality if I didn't already know what it was. You couldn't make out leaf shape bark type or anything just kind of a green blur lol. 

But holy crap... It works on ariel images too (though requires a higher quality than Google Maps). Should be interesting for things like foraging. 

I've tried this previously and I can say the results are much much better in this version. 

I also asked it to identify the best fishing locations given a general map of a local creek. I've fished the creek before I know the best spots. It identified them fairly well. It knew the best spots and I asked it to highlight them on the map which it kinda succeeded / kinda failed. It generated the outline overlay in Python and the overlay would have been in the correct location but it didn't actually generate the requested image. The code was correct though. The pieces are there just needs a little more polishing on the output. But what's impressive is the logic it used. It could see color in the water to estimate the depth in various parts it located a bend in the creek where the water flow would be slower  just upstream of a weir thus more attractive to fish and an area with cover for the fish and even considered land accessibility since a creek that size would likely be fished from shore. It was able to analyze the image and use knowledge of freshwater fish habitat and fishing practices and pin down the ideal location. 

I tested that because I seriously doubt anyone at OpenAI has considered that use case. But the results were absolutely correct. Imagine a lengthier custom prompt and uploading some local fishing guides and actually telling it the region time of year or fish species the local fishing regulations etc. Fishing guides you are on notice you could be obsolete by this afternoon lol. Imagine what this could do for the commercial fishing industry as well. Even if it offers a 1% improvement in yields that's massive at scale."
It just means that the 5th paid version will be released soon.
"Too much chatting. Is it any better than previous model at answering complex questions generating code images music etc?"
Damn bitbacks took my jawb.
this channel used to have a more wholesome comment section.
"super cool but I instantly HATE that fake overly friendly kindergarden teacher voice. Hope that can be changed."
Hyperbolic speed.
Free if you don't value keeping your personal data from being mined.
why is everyone saying it is free? it is not. it is 20$ a month.
I didn't get 4o as a free user. So not everyone.
"I feel like yesterday's event really undersold the model. When I saw the related article my mind was blown..."

 Leading to unending rabbit holes of questions to do things like untangle domain specific terminology/notation disambiguate madeup/overloaded abstractions/concepts tracking down archives for broken referenced websites or also: uncompressing smaller subproblems with the same set of content-problems just to be able to understand the bigger problem so much so you end up spending more time making trying to find relevant answers than on the problem itself."

"I tried various experiments on ""paper"" and ""pen"" ... drawing a character who must travel from point A to point B the path is rough with a big chasm. So I drew C a piece of ""wood iron"" whatever just the right size to cover the chasm. Then I asked if A must proceed to B considering that his path is bumpy and there is a hole what could A due to be able to continue his adventure without falling into the pothole and risking his life? There were various answers such as that he could ""nimbly try to descend the pothole and then climb up it although it requires skill etc..."" or ""he could find an alternative passage"" and ""he could use a piece already there which is called C that from the dimensions should cover the pothole perfectly..."" then I photographed some porcelain fruit inside a white basket also made of porcelain the fruit was perfectly drawn then a real apple.  immediately found that the basket was too perfect shiny...

Seems like nearly all of them were laughing at me which one of them wrote: if that easy then why not create it myself. I asked the dude where did I mention being ""easy"" plus... I don't even have anywhere near enough money to have a powerful enough computer at my disposal like those who create AAA games basically from scratch as a team. It was like... they somehow imagined themselves as experts in the field when they are obviously all clueless about the entire ordeal."
"Great its teaching but when its gonna be my waifu?"
Narrator’s voice is super annoying.  Why do you keep whispering “and” and making run-on sentences?  🤮
Would be great if the ai actually know something and doesnt instantly change its opinion when you question it 😂

"Imagine the propaganda it could educate the masses. Truly a wonderful tool. The only thing it should be good at is math then comes ideology. Imagine that."
"It's not available for free users at least not in Germany"
"Remember : When it's free it's because YOU'RE the product"
The voice of the new AI is like Glados from the Portal game.
My job is going to get replaced by this within a few years
The latency is insane. HER answers so quickly
"It's coming in the next few weeks not yet available for free"
"Am I the only one who is watching ""Her"" just because of gpt-4o?"
What a time to be alive!!!
come and come
Mine says its gpt 4 but doesn't know what 4o is
I always wanted the future but now I'm just scared of it. Because it's not owned by us someone else controls it.
"Take THAT Google!  Released the day before the annual Google developer's conference."
Ya they made if free to try but only few conversations allowed for a day
Is it still as woke and biased as ever?
Stop lying.
did you actually get sponsored by microsoft or are you simply promoting azure ai
This stuff is so cool but man does it ramp up my existential dread. No way I am making it to retirement.
"Hi Matt. Is there an AI app for Android that answers calls automatically? I mean something that functions similarly to voicemail?"
I don't think they had internet issues... The new model allows you to interrupt the model as it's speaking so I think that the breaks in the audio live demo were allot to do with that.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
And yet we Plus users were tricked 😔 now.
Reminds me of the Disney Channel movie Smart House (1999)
"Great Information Thanks Matt!
Blessings To Everyone 🙏 ❤✨️"
If politicians had a final say they would not let AI to be used freely by people all over the world.
R.I.P. siri... 2011 - 2024
No mention of Dall-E3 being free?
So it deals with latency exactly as we do.
"Born too Late to discovery the new world.
Born too early to discovery the stars.

BUT ... Born in the AI Goldilocks zone!"
Can I show it my deck?

"''Yes kids in the past we used to control computers with our hands. We had a keyboard and a mouse. And it helped us to tell the computer what to do.''"
Is this just available in the US? And not in Canada? It doesn’t seem to be working up here at all.
A few google employees will get fired after this video
Can we get this with Cortana voice mod please and thanks!!!
That female voice is so cringe like that Her movie
"Holding the phone is stupidthey will introduce some kind of glasses soon for sure ! Or brain implants !"
Bros... I think I'm cooked [Officer K looking at Joi.png]
where is 4.0 in the playground? My playground only shows 3.5 variants.
Damn!! What the actual fuck!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
When the signing started I was reminded of Hal from 2001 singing Daisy Daisy as he was being dismateled after killing the crew of the spaceship Discovery.  But of course that could never happen in the real world ;)
Costs 20 a month
"New version is terrible... it just break convos to say pay. Suuden and loosing all work with gp. spit."
The OpenAI relationship to SAS companies is like Amazon to their sellers. Get data on the successful products and then make them themselves.
"Yeah they love dropping stuff right before other companies because for them it's all about how hard they can strike their own ego. It's petty and unsettling considering how good their stuff is."
The blonde presenter talks unnaturally fast and weird. He sounds more AI than Chatgpt.
@Matt: The glitches were the model being interrupted by the audience noise while also trying to finish the audio piece.
I can tell you one thing gpt4 and now gpt4o don't do well and that is code. They lose context so quickly and frequently shorten functions and lose resolution. It is something that Claude Opus has really excelled at. I am excited what 4o can do in the voice arena and I am happy it has gotten much faster and is still good with some debugging tasks and really creative tasks. But I am just shocked at how bad it is at coding after Opus had come up and crushed it.
I cant get it to work
Very impressive. I was thrown off by the aeroplane symbol which on android means networks are disabled. Just checked & it just means no calls or Bluetooth on iOS.
Twist: the hosts are all robots 😅
"Only me see monopolistic none yet regulated strategy for overtaking more and more of IT  translation  gathering of data."
"oh dear lord..if ai talks to me like that I'm going to vomit.. just saccharine sweet to the point of 'just stop speaking now please' - and yes I know there are options for the speaking voice but it's also the 'oh hey there big boy' kind of response that is off putting - then the adding the drama etc.. it was all truly horrible and I enjoy ai  (ps.. the ai presenters not good either)  - I'll say one thing.. making human interactions look better"
"How long until you can have a relationship with it? Sounds like Scarlett Johansson from ""Her"""
"Every time I hear the human interrupt the AI it irks me like he's being rude even tho I know it's AI.... So if this is how we will communicate with AI will that bleed  into human to human communication? Im picturing my kids interrupting me over and over and it's already annoying me"
Part of me sees this in devices like humane to help assist us. The other part feels like we’re building our own prison.
"Dude love your work- but ChatGBT is a heap of shit and Youtubers need to stop blasting it with compliments and clickbait. I upgraded to a paid subscription and spent an entire afternoon trying ot create a basic GBT that just got stuck in drafts... restricted me all of a sudden because they apparently limit your use...  Never again. I want my money back from that scam. It's a hyped up heap of shit."
How do you access the voice function? I don't see it on my Pro account.
"Matt you're a good man.  Appreciate all that you do to keep us informed about AI."
"Sorry to burst the 4o bubble but I’ve been using it this morning (As a Business Team subscription holder) and it’s glitchy as. It keeps randomly replying to me in Welsh even though I’m speaking English. The speech audio keeps breaking up to the point it’s unintelligible then it just gave up saying it couldn’t continue due to demand.
Anyone else finding this?"
"I'm on their free plan and I do not have 4o yet nor do I have the ability to upload or link to images."
"Google announcement: Gemini still can’t answer simple questions. 
I think that’s what they are going to announce."
"I just got access to GPTo and I'm happy to say that it is the first LLM that I've tested that was able to decode an Atbash cipher!"
Give every agent a human feel score.
"Are these updated vision and realtime conversation capabilities available to everyone already? I’m on the 4o model but it feels pretty much the same to me and i dont have the ability to open up the camera or anything fun like that."
PI AI also has a very good as good voice
I don't understand why they'd give it to Apple rather than Cortana given their partnership with Microsoft
Gpt 4o is not available in a free version yet..
Its free to collect data. Afterwards it will be behind a paywall guaranteed.
The difference between Open Ai and Google is that Open Ai makes it available right away. Google are just demos and not even in real time
"Need to put this into EV's maybe they'll sell."
"Matt I question it being free. Have you tried that free version  yourself? Find your burner email account login and poke around with chat gpt 4o for 20 minutes then come back here and tell me again that it's free not Free to Try."
"Thank you so much for these videos! I'm retired late 60s 38 yr IT veteran so I have a natural compulsion to keep up with what's going on. But even with my background I was starting to feel overwhelmed at what I didn't know until I started watching your channel.  What's even scarier are none of my age cohorts (retired IT or not) have any idea what's coming! I mention news I've heard on your channel and they are completely uninformed and confused (the same folks that think they'll be prepared if they keep getting paper bills from the electric company). AI is currently changing our entire world and I think everyone needs to stay current. This isn't just some new version of Windows being released - it's life-altering. I've sent so many of your videos to my friends hoping to help educate. I don't want to be that old lady in a few years yelling at the robot checking out my groceries. Thank you for keeping me updated!"
"Not free in Australia.  $20 per month for GPT4o access.  Claude is about $6 per day so it's cheaper than that"
"I guess they’re not concerned about casual users paying for Plus because there seems to be no reason for it"
"Mac only has 9% market share so obvioulsy coming to PC."
"""and it's Free"" = 20$ month 🤣🤣🤣
Same as your Netflix subscription - everything is free)"
I open  Chat GPT and is says 3.5. Nothing about GPT-4o.
customizing the tone and behaviour of the voice would be INSANELY GREAT! not all people like that voice and that tone over and over again...
Does the free still say 3.5 but it's 4o? All I see is 3.5.
"Blade runner here we come who needs a human woman"
Crazy what this will be like in 10 years…and then think of robotics
It’s not free
ALL THAT WORK N IITS STILL TRASH SMH
I’m also not seeing 4o in the playground section. Maybe country based?
"I bet as this AI tries to replicate a quirky personality its going to have the wrong tone with the wrong person and they will be offended."
"""They made it start speaking before it was ready to start speaking."" That's probably the most human characteristic. 😂 But seriously this is amazing. I just tried it out (I already have it with GPT+). I literally just asked when it would be available and it answered immediately without pause ""You should have it already."" Brilliant! I'll have so much fun today testing it all out. I'm a Google fanboy but Google really missed the train in regards to AI. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"upvote if you are a gentleman who has a crush on mira murati
(i mean her name literally means ""LOOK!"")"
So basically it can do what google faked the last time
When do free users get this?
Excellent.
Altman be praised 😍
"All the company tech is Rumble Battle in AI models..
ChatGPT 4.o realease...

Google microsoft etc.. is on 🔥🔥🔥 😂😁
Let's see who is the winner.."

Thanks Matt - great presentation!
Am I the only person having a visceral emotional response to this?
"What do you mean *latency?* On my phone app you had to actually press a ""listen"" button then manually stop it then it would be transcribed and then you manually send it as a prompt to GPT. Have some users had fully seamless conversational functionality (GPT 4)??"
The woman doing the presentation looks like an AI bot.
"Google censoring the heck out of my responses here including the one where I called them a menace to humanity. 😂"
I do not have access to ChatGPT-4o in Playground. It only shows 3.5.
"After testing this is impressing but this is not Free this is limited to few queries and you must upgrade to the payed version for the complete service."
Playground says I have no free usage.  Uhh
"Not at all human. No TDS or hummus flag waving and chants."
"All guys demand Open AI to bring forth Number Six of Battlestar Galactica and we are set."
New brand war between google and open ai and for now is 0 -1 for open ai . I would like to see more companies worldwide get to the challenge too
"I have 4o  in the app. But not the emotive voice chat just normal voice chat as before."
When smth is free ... U r the product
How to download it.........?
Everybody gangsta until the reach message limit showed up!
"Matt YOU REMOVED THE PAUSES! ARRGGH. You're trying to help but you destroyed the whole point of your video. We CANNOT TELL HOW RESPONSIVE THIS NEW BOT IS BECAUSE YOU REMOVED THE PAUSES!"
is it just me or is the free version on desktop not available right now. I'm from the Netherlands. still only the GPT 3.5 here
"I can’t use it in Canada anybody else having the same issue??"
"I find it interesting that suddenly the free bing ""co-pilot"" chatGPT no longer knows what version it is. When asked previously it told me 3.5. Now it behaves like it has amnesia."
"10:00 Adding filler words? Sounds like what a human would do to hide the ""latency"" 😁"
I thought it was strange when I was talking to my AI chatbot and smoking a bowl. I started coughing a bit and it asked me if I was all right. That really confused me for a minute
"Im from South Africa have the paid version  choose Chatgpt 4o but see no difference to version 4"
Cant chat on the mobile app any longer LAME. Plus dont like the new chat version.
And still not a single ethical usage discovered for it.
"they are getting the world to develop their app fo them in real time! its ingenius . that's why they are letting people build on top of api . once the community breaks a certain threshold of new applications. they do a little market research  suck all the new popular developments into the new source code. rinse and repeat"
"I used the voice on 4 o in uk but it hasn't changed for me.
The voice I'm using is different to the one in the event so is that the reason.
I doubt that since it would likely be on all voices but I do have access to 4 o and it is faster but I was looking forward to that part of the new features.
The Voice.
Do you also know when the mac app will be availible.
Either way I will keep checking the release notes till I see the update"
none of this is available for free. at least not right now it isn't. might wanna check the site again.
OpenAI will take over 😁 mark my words
"It wont ""feel human"" until it refuses to do whatever i ask it and begins complaining about how I don't appreciate it enough."
I do not see 4o in the playground
They do the UFC strategy.  Book announcements/ events on the same day or weekend of your competitors
I still only have 3.5 after using your 4o link
This woman is very nice ❤
"I don't have acces to gtp4 is it becourse I am not from the USA??"
"Here's a demo I'd like to see:  show it a kids' cartoon and ask it to read it to a child ""doing the voices""."
"None of the features are available for us ""paid"" users."
"Hey Matt amazing video as always! Love it! ... I can't find gpt 4o in the playground that I connect to right now. Did they enroll it just in specific countries? (I am in Albania right now)"
Great roundup thanks mate
I'm not American and also not a slow adult.  I hope there is a way of toning it down. I hate this affected way of speaking.
the insincerity of the AI voice.. that's what's irritating
This made me think of how much value software developers could add to their products by bundling an AI Tutor along side their more complex offerings. FreeCAD and Blender come to my mind instantly.
Show it a photo of anyone and ask it to identify who it is. Says it all. Can't wait for non-openai ai.
I apparently have ChatGPT4o (it is one of my options now) but I don't have that voice and it can't see any video live. What is that all about?
*_It wont be long now before we are bowing to our machine god._*
Thx Max! head to the playground now!
"biggest issue is OpenAI going down a few times every day or hacks or whatever lobotomizes the poor GPT4 turbo and turns him into a dumb thing till fixed. So unreliable unless has a Claude fallback. Alas Claude also started suffering. The other day he couldn't count 2+3. SO all LLMs are still unstable for serious commercial usage."
This is sick
Still not out in eastern europe
"Finally we can play the very special edition of Skyrim."
its basically Alexa on crack
Did you notice that people on Open Ai looks like all robots? All polished and all... idk... looks like im realy scared now.
I feel lucky to be alive in these times.
"SPAM< SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAMSPAM UR ON REPEAT ANSD NOTHINGS NEW OR COOL ITS ALL THE SAME STUFF ""THE NEW VERSION BLOWS THIS OTHER VERSION OUT OF THE WATER OOOOOHHH AHHHH RINSE MILK REPEAT>>>"""
It is pretty cringe actually. Making jokes and quips
"I don't really mind if it puts in umms and ahhs while it thinks that's what humans do"
"Finally a technology that always understands me shares my worries helps me is always with me and at a call or a nod. Why bother with strenuous social contact teachers or friends or even partners. Everything is tiring and inconsequential inconsiderate except ChatGPT. In a few years we'll have the first church where some weirdos worship this. Omniscient without image everywhere immortal created by all of us through communication full of compassion and forgiveness the return of the Son."
Wow! What a news! Thank you for sharing ❤
"you are the best mate. can you do a video on the best AI software yo can have on your desktop. my fav so far is perplexity made me essentially stop using normal browser search engines keep it up you are my fav to wagtch in this space"
"Great stuff again Matt. Sam out here changing the game. Again."
i just got gpt4o!
You should see the videos of two of these talking to each other by phone..
"I just wanted to correct something about the part when she says she sees a table. If you look closely there was a table shot before his face appeared on the screen. She was going by that."
Awesome Matt!!! GTP 4o
"Such an amazing technology and it's being presented by less human ""people"" then the AI itself. Their conversation was cringy at best. The coolest thing I find about the new model is it's much less sexist and racist."
I would have asked for it to do a Morgan Freeman voice
"Great video Matt thank you! I hope you have a great time. The progress is incredible. I happily paid for a Plus subscription to access GPT-4. However what's the benefit at the moment? The new features haven't been released yet and the Windows app isn't available either"
when does it actually fully come out tho with all the features that were demo'd
“Robots and love”? Wtf
"""T.A.R.S let's take that sarcasm setting down to 60 percent"" - it will be crazy when personalized models allow for real time parameter tuning (beyond just temperature and prompting)"
"""All free users will have access to it"" true (10 answers and go back to 3.5 and you have to wait 24h) so... free access huh?!"
I find it hilarious that OpenAI uses Apple hardware when they are contracted by Microsoft. That says a LOT!
That's it!! I'm going to go live in a cave! 🤣
It's almost Jarvis
"Why wouldn't THEY make it available to everyone? It helps them with their LLM (Large Language Model)! The more INPUT they can get from ALL OF US the better their product will be in the long run! I DO believe that there should be restrictions put on it and that it should be regulated to make sure that it isn't harmful in ANY WAY! It has the capability to destroy US ALL!"
How can I use it on my smartphone?
"And the other thing with building on top of chat gpt. You have to think about whether your business idea has a moat. It's sort of like someone that creates a flashlight application on ios or android. Or an application like Shazam. Those types of applications don't have any moats at all so there's nothing shady about open ai incorporating things that should be part of the main product. Some of those things were probably already in their roadmaps. So somebody would have to be able to build something that does have a moat. Whatever that software solution is."
openAI may be the company to eventually take googles top spot. waiting on the day for openAI phones
Not avaliable in the UK yet for free users 🤔
i have this already
This is what we expected from Rabbit r1. But let's see how this really goes.
People are going to fall in love with this.
"I can only access 3.5 on mobile or PC or 4 on PC if i pay."
"Can't access it it defaults immediately back to 3.5"
Desktop app is Mac only for now. Windows next year.
"I hope that when this gets integrated into Windows Microsoft finally brings back Cortana she sounds like her so much."
"Doesn't appear to be available in the UK. I can't afford a subscription so I asked GPT 3.5 if 4o is available - since it's training cuts off at 2022 it didn't have any info and when I went to the playground link I typed one short question and it told me I was out of credits or whatever and didn't answer. Guess we'll just have to wait in third-world UK until later."
"When Chat GPT first came out I told my friends that in less than 2 years we would be able to talk to it just like Tony Stark talked to Jarvis in Ironman. Well world meet Open AIs version of Jarvis! I knew I wasn´t crazy LOL!"
My question is when will chat GPT end their association with MS?— Or will Chat GPT just be subsumed as feared?
twist in the plot: that was actually an actor backstage pretending to be GPT-4o!!  (disclaimer: this comment is a joke)
"I don´t like it to be free it is more difficult to get an advantage if everyone can use it."
"I generally like your content but when you're showing a ""live"" demo to show response times it's in bad taste to crop frames"
NEXT LEVEL but So tired of these amazing Next Level Ais given away to all for free (Like Adobe Firefly to those when some of us paying $60 a month for creative cloud and GPT+ $20 every single month)
"Just a 'Thanks' Matt.  Really appreciate your work at keeping us up to date."
"I use chatgpt 3.5 then as I don’t pay. It is very silly. I’ll check is 4o is silly too soon"
There’s not enough difference between Plus and Free to warrant $20 per month anymore. Maybe something better than 5x capacity is coming
"Matt the OpenAI executive does not even have half of ur enthusiasm. Maybe u should take her job."
"They had no choice but to make it free everyone else is."
When is this rolling out live to free app (Android)???
"Wow! Ur obsessed with chatgpt dude even got a hat 😅"
"My account on free tier I only aee gpt-3.5 have any free tier users seen gpt-4o yet? 😮😮😮"
"Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Looking at this am I wrong?"
"""and it's free"" . No it is not."
"How did he activate the camera I don't see that on my app"
"I'm intrigued but they rushed to announce before their desktop app was available for Windows or Android. I'm not a Mac hater but most folks use PC so this seems a bit premature."
"Message cap is lower than ever. I have to decide if I want to quit plus. OpenAI this is no fun."
She doesn't seem human.. is she AI?
The Movie HER turned out to be right about our future 🤧
our Desktop/Cyborg App is coming along noice... we are almost there folks
Great video. 👍
How do we get it exactly? Is it not released yet?
it will be so free like a pay to win game is...
"yo can we have a new autoGPT install guide because their gonna change everything because of this"
It doesn't feel remotely human unless you count Terri Schiavo. It's also not free.
It bugs me that Sam is toying with us and making cryptic tweets and releasing stuff secretly and then yanking it and then returning it without a press release or anything. He is toying with us. This is immature and shows a lack of respect for his customers. It's bukkship!!!! Grow up Sam. Don't become Musk.
No gpt-40 for me in playground. Must be a rolling out thing.
"The energy and hardware requirements when millions of people are using it every day all day."
"Its huge its actually conversational! Don't underestimate this? In the AI string you get the Speech to text intelligence and then text to speech used to be high latency now conversational less overheads. Great."
No it does not nothing like a human it only respond fast.
The time is coming when the a.i model will introduce itself
I'm surprised when I hear people talking about this new model being able to communicate so realistically as something totally new. I have been using the free version of Pi for number of months now and it's totally human sounding. It understands my sarcasm humor my moods and yet I don't hear people talking about it. This new model you're presenting definitely has advantages over pea who is limited to just voice text there is no possibility to send pictures or videos as I was able to do this morning with Claude but was very limited to just a few exchanges in the free version. I sent it a picture of where I was sitting and described everything around me very clearly I wish p could do the same because I doubt the new version of chat GPT will be available for those who don't pay.
Gpt 4o is the next big thing.
"Careful with those thumbnails your eyes are almost popping out"
What will happen once Frankenstein 's monster chooses to disobey...?
Wow came in early
Where is the icon for the voice conversation l am using 4o on my android and dont see it
Okay I thought it was available to try for free. I logged into my account at that playground link and I only see 3.5
"Be extremely careful of computing anything sensitive in cloud. Remember Replika and it's even not the worst case"
"no ""O"" on my chat gpt 😙"
"Comment by Sam Altman on his blog ""As we add (optional) personalization access to your information the ability to take actions on your behalf and more I can really see an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before."" This literally means 'Her' and personally not very far from atleast a cognitive AGI."
I need to stop paying 20 bucks if free users can use the same as I pay for
"'sorry I'm having issues right now. Our systems are experiencing heavy load' ..."
did she call it Siri at 9:23?
"Does nobody see this being a bit creepy also? 
(It scans your clipboard has access to your camera understand emotions context)"
"Things like this make you appreciate art like Her. I fear a lot for our future but all I hope is that we retain our humanity. It seems happening rather so soon. what is real? what is value? more so what does it mean to be human now?"
Scarlett is gonna sueeeeee
"I think the biggest breakthrough is it's apparent self awareness and Humanisation
Exactly what AGI needs to be to be accepted generally since people dont want some Super Intelligent Perfect AGI overlord they want Robot/AI ""friends"""
"""Please watch this video of my wife and analyze her face voice and the content of what she's saying for deception."""
"I am an ""old"" computer dude. I have been in the industry for over 40 years and I saw this as inevitable. I am a bit slow now and health doesn't help so I may be relying on AI a lot more. I don't speak Filipino well and my wife's understanding of English is not great. Thanks for the intro to the future Matt. Cheers 🖖🖖"
At 11.16 that laugh has the tone of embarrassment from making a mistake.. it's crazy.. almost makes me think this is fake..
Why do you need to paste your own face in every thumbnail? The video isn't about you dude. Get over yourself. You aren't Tom Cruise
Adding filler seems legit since that's what people do to buy time to think of an answer. And a fully formed answer right out the gate could sound artificial in some cases.
Am I doing something wrong because when I go to playground all I see is chat 3.5 not 40??
I'm not seeing this on Playground; I assume that you have to have a paid account to get access to it just now?
"They are smart to make it free at this stage every interaction is a learning step for the model."
If it's free your the product. Just a mass data collection app.
"I hope you can switch the voice emotions off so distracting."
What's the point of + subscription now?
"""It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine"". -REM. Actually we're toast. 😁🤖👾"
"I robot is starting to realise."
So what will be the difference between free and Pro? Should I not pay for Pro anymore? You did talk about that
Elon lawsuit working
"Daisy Daisy......"
"wow my gf has finally been born Im only 36 years older than her :)"
Put it inside of a robot.
"In the realm where circuits hum and lights flicker bright
OpenAI revealed its Omni might.
A desktop app a fresh new look
GPT-4O not what you mistook.

""Hey ChatGPT how do you do?""
A voice responds emotions true.
Transcribing talking feeling too
An AI friend both old and new.

In a world where whales could speak
AI would help us bold yet meek.
A simple laugh a sigh a pause
AI emulates human flaws.

So here we stand at the brink
Of a future closer than we think.
With AI's touch so soft and near
A new dawn rises crystal clear."
"""Her"" is comming."
"The age of robots is closer and closer still lacks intelligence and intent tho"
OMGGG just speechless 😮
"What do we make of all the emotions? I mean just the other day everybody said that AI will never have emotions. I think if you ask it it will still tell you that. But this tells something else. Of course you could still argue how real this is. But it seems very real. And isn’t this what counts?"
"I am wondering if it is available for Europe would you know about it? Overall for cloude and llama it is restricted unless with vpn so i keep restricted to chatgpt to save a subscription. Thanks jn advance"
"great update keep it up!!! I feel in the loop."
So it deals with latency exactly as we do
Matt! I like your hat! Where did you get it?
Wake me up when there's a snarky Gina Garofalo AI that insults me in ways that I find enjoyable for some weird reason.
"Technically it couldn't feel human because you can't even touch it and it doesn't have skin. Spring Update 2025?"
Will chatbots be able to immediately switch over to GPT4o?
"I've said this many years ago and I'm so happy it's finally coming together; soon we'll be able to prompt A.I. to just make a full-length movie with any actor or plot you want on the fly I think our media consumption will soon be catered to ourselves personally. I do wonder what efffect it will have on artists and creators throughout. Here's hoping that we'll find a good way to let A.I. assist us in our creative endeavors while still needing that human touch"
As for closing the gap with filler words while thinking up a response ... People do that.
Does anyone know how to get the desktop app?
"when I saw the demo video from openAI and heard the chatbot talk I said to myself ""come on that's gonna be pre recorded right!? "" it sounded so human it was scary! 
 I am really impressed with what openAI has done so far ever since chatgpt was launched."
Doesnt seem like a huge leap..just added a voice. Gpt 4 can do almost all these things if you prompt it correctly.
Ai femboy boyfriends when?
"Feels like talking with a robot friend. I can see them plugging that in to a robot to bring them to life. I was struggling getting into the conversation mode its the headphone icon. I want it for the desktop app as my lap top is my main tool."
What cool about it is they just got closer to replacing or augmenting teachers. You can learn so much and get real life sounding feedback and directions.What I like to do is have it explain complex topics with multiple anologies. So having a conversational chatbot like this is going to help parents as well when they have to help or check their kids homework.
She sounds just like Scarlett 😳
Imagine when this can translate it in the speaker's own voice and quicker.
Imagine developers creating something that will take away their job.
Alexa just got replaced lol within the next few months or years everyone  will have thier own AI Agent/ assistant
Plot twist: Everyone on the stage was AI
"Ahh Look at Marks head when he says hello and while he converses with ""her"" you can see there are edits there. The new 4o DOES NOT respond that fast. I was conversing with it last night and this morning and compared to this video they put out it's no where nearly as fast. Again they did cheat a bit with editing."
I have more latency in my own speech.
"Just based off the the title not it’s doesn’t. AI is easily confused"
Real live training?
Any idea why I have reached the limit without even asking a single question?
What a time to be alive! 🙌
"Thanks Matt. You've shown me that the hype is overblown and it's really not much new here. Thumbs up.
The mainstream media is definitely taking a closer look though..."
"Basically a free trail for the people that don’t spend money on it. You can only send a few messages before you need to wait 3 hours. In my opinion useless."
"Nope I still got only GPT 3.5. No changes in Poland yet... and strange situation. On Android app i can send text files and photos while on PC (browser) I can only chat :). ...well even stranger situation now... after updating Android app I've lost options to attach files or photos...:)))) annoying"

And this guys is the answer to the Fermi Paradox…
Pretty gross to say how an AI feels that is technically a slave to you. Good job being a modern day slaver.
Thanks Matt Wolfe for the quality content. Love the video
how to do the natural conversation?
Welcome to the imposed and expected niceties of the 'Demolition Man.'
hopefully that American micky mouse patronising voice  can be changed  😒
Anybody else thinking that presenter lady is cgi?
1 step closer to being married to ScarJo.
How much hardware is required to run just one instance of this? Will it one day be possible to run locally on a standalone device like an offline robot? I'm not a fan of everything being dependent on an internet connection all the time.
I wish nothing but for it to have claptrap's voice and personality
Does Chat GPT 4.0 have real time data?
have you tried PI by inflection AI?  This new GPT 4o seems like that on steroids.
My free account don’t have the audio responses anymore but my paid account does
Education equity for Myanmar. I shared it with my parents here (I am a teacher and known Myanmar YouTuber)
Why don’t we get a soothing male voice
Hyperbole
"does anyone know what Custom GPT's use? There does not seem an option to change to GPT 4-O. Also when will live vision be rolled out? does not seem to be there yet. I also went into the app the the real time conversation was nothing like the demo it seemed still the old one. Hoping they will roll this out to the voice chat soon."
When is this releasing? I don't have that option just ChatGpt 3.5 and that's it.
But you need an external voice? A tts? Don’t see that usecase anywhere in the playground
"""Everybody gets free access to the top model""
...which probably means that WE are the product."
So google assistant Alexa siri
Matt Wolfe looks like Post Malone  🧔‍♂
"First we had nuclear bombs now we have AI"
"The response time I’m seeing isn’t as good as shown on the livestream but it may be getting overloaded with people now."
Sounds like siri. Dont like the over enthusiastic secretary voice.
"If this is what everyone gets for free imagine what GPT-5 is going to do? The next few years are going to be nuts!"
I am not a plus member and this model is not yet available to me.
"Correction; it's not free
Your data and interaction -- which will evolve the ai further -- is the payment"
"So far ive gotten 3 updates to the android app since the announcement 2 days ago. And all theyve done is removed the voice chat feature entirely for free users 🙄 im hoping these are systematic updates to prep for the big 4o update.

Edit: nevermind. Im a dummy. Some how with one of the updates the setting to ""improve model for everyone"" got toggled which also disabled the voice chat feature. Nothing to see here. Carry on 😆"
No improvements other than speed. You can't use the video while chatting (android) and there isn't a desktop app (windows) so yeah... a Big Nothing Burger.
Dang really giving PI AI a run for it's money
"If Elon Musk has not threatened them with court action they would not have given us an advance free model."
"Wait wait
So AI is able to comprehend emotions now?"
The bokeh of your camera is amazing! It reminds me of my old Canon EF 50mm L f1.2.
"Now y’all gotta admit… this shit is pretty sick. Damn!"
Thanks Matt
"I live in Scotland. American AI voices are a bit annoying to my ear (no offense just not the patois I hear daily) does Chat GPT 4o change accents to suit the listener?"
"This guy seems to be the most honest and serious of the AI influencers. He will tell you also about the little tricks that they are doing to make it seem that this is ""better"". Which by the way they never explicitly say anywhere. Especially not on the update notes and TOS. They clearly state that - besides smooth multi-modality implementation - the main advantage is that it has higher rate limit aka it is less limited and therefore faster already. It probably is a bit better trained especially specifically on these highly game-able benchmarks I would bet...

Sure they all have to do the sensational thumbs and tell you it's ""free""...which it technically is but you will not feel free using it if you actually try to. The rate limit is too severe. I had 10 messages and then had to wait 2.5h. That is still generous compared to what others are doing with the daily refill. It is also not accumulative but that is to be expected.
And even the paying customers should be weary whenever they hear the words ""up to"" because 0 is implicitly included. If I were to pay for this and might expect to not even be able to use the raw model on the site...yeah not sure that will be such a great experience.

You will not be using that chatty-flirty bot that soon no matter if you pay or not. I don't think it will be out for Windows separately. Microsoft is controlling OpenAI. I assume they will bundle it with Windows Bing Copilot and Teams. This is Microsoft's chance to get Mac user data.

But the context is still very low with only 128k. This will not be useful for expert systems. Google is looking way better there with the 2m context. But that will also come at the expense of speed. It all depends on how you want to use AI. It seems that OpenAI - or rather Microsoft - is focusing on consumers for now. While Google is going for business as well."
"When it's free the product is you."
I have the paid version of ChatGPT. Is it worth it or is the free plan all most people need?
I don't know what I would do if you didn't keep me up to date. Thanks for all your hard work.... Zimmwriter user from the very beginning.
I’m trying out 4o and it’s making a LOT OF MISTAKES. Anyone else experience this?
The bot sounded more natural than those two dudes.
I'm already seeing 4o in the chatgpt app 🤘
Samantha is here.
"Chat GPT 4o is cool for sure but Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google is just on an another level
It’s like GOT 4o but on steroids.
When people will realize it they’ll forget about OpenAI 😅"
At 9:12 i ROFLed so hard i barely got up again xD
What a crazy piece of technology. Never would’ve imagined in the early 20s we’d have something like this
we fuckd
how to access?
Why does singing not work on my ChatGPT 4o version ??? I have it on my iPhone
i don't like her tone tho
Whats the point of paying now?
Wait so the Rabbit is obsolete?
What do you mean they incorporated an AI girlfriend?
where is the link to this app?
4o model is better then 4 by a good amount.  I have a gpts that I use for my work that pulls data from a table and 4 always takes a lot of hand holding to get it working with the environment.  4o did it right the first try.  And it’s crazy fast
isn't the default personality too extra? annoying. but impressive. i just hope it would understand my mumbling better than OpenAI whisper coz it was state of the art and still sucked at understanding context and dealing with AC noise
"I wish we cold actually use any of these features! I’m a long time gpt plus subscriber and it has added 4o as a model yes a bit faster but as of today in plus on my account there’s no new voice vision pic/video… features. The experience of using chat gpt iOS app today was identical with no changes except the name 4o on the screen. Voice chat was slow as ever failed bout a third of the time chat latency was significant with text and almost unusable with voice which is always the case and is what I’ve really been wanting. So i know it’s dope these features exsist but I just wish they’d be clearer about the fact if you pay for the best version you still won’t have em for an undisclosed amount of time"
"Hey paid users thanks for your money. You can cancel your subscription now."
Holy guacamole
"Oh hey i finally have someone to talk to 🙃"
"I'm sure it's a great product but in reality it will not not be as ""free"" ""high performance"" and ""feature rich"" for free users as they pretend it to be in their infomercial yes infomercial."
"ChatGPT is such a ungainly name to keep on saying perhaps a short pseudonym could be used."
So is this all? Is this the Big upgrade Sama was takling about.. i hope there Will be another model release later this year
The Norwegian wins this round
"This video must be taken the most time if you want to examine all the main features in just 25 minutes! Thanks Wolf"
"I don't want to see your face show me what the AI is capable of"
Mass surveillance 2.0
"Thx for sharing great info Matt"
THIS IS INSANE!! How are we this far along already?!
"I keep seeing comparisons to Her. But with the vision part it makes me think of KITT more than anything."
Did they use MacBook as an example to give Apple a blow before they release their own AI?
"To be fair humans use filler words to bridge thoughts all the time. To me it sounds more human than it would without them."
All existing voice assistant apps are soon to be replaced with LLMs like this.
"there may be inbetweening at certain points but for the most part it was answering immediately even when singing that song!"
The desktop app is only for Mac 🙄 I'm sure Microsoft asked them not to make a Windows version so it wouldn't compete with copilot
"The glitches in the GPT-4o demo were not due to connectivity they said in the beginning that the cable was there for internet connectivity.

Notice however how GPT-4o cuts out immediately when it hears someone else speaking. I think the microphone was a bit too sensitive and intermittently picked up sounds from the audience in that particular demo."
Is there a switch where you can make it not 'super exited' and finding things 'awesome'
"If it's free then why pay for their subscription? That seems a bit annoying for their loyal subscribers."
"Just watched the Google demo for Project Astra it literally states it's a vision of what they'd to achieve. That's the equivalent of ""Not actual in-game graphic"". Not a good look Google."
The singing is so bad it’s even more realistic and awesome.
"I'd like to know what does the free version vs paid version capacity look like in practical terms. I have the paid version but no idea whether I would still need it or not according to my usage (i.e.: not sure if I ran out of capacity or not). Can anyone put it into perspective? How much general usage is ok for the free version and how much requires the paid one?
Thank you"
19:00 Fake news. They have a video that dismissed this. The famous bunny one.
9:35 🤯
The filler words are exactly what we do when asked a difficult question. I'm not sure what jobs are left for humans. I had better learn to rebuild an engine! The trouble is no one will be able to pay me to do that because they won't have jobs. Exciting times!😂
Not free.
"Question is will it pass the bias tests?"
God damn another shouting voice
Its the Star Trek computer!
Wonder if it can do sign language
Anyone else find the AI female voice unbearable?
With this update. Do we also get to use gpt store as well?
"In the morning the app has voice feature but now it disappear"
loved it!!!!
"The text structure and how it uses words has not improved it was no different from what I've been using previously. I just hope chatgpt 5 this year solves that problem in structuring words and such. I did like the chat assistant though I've never tried the voice part of it yet. I can see it taking over assistants such as alexa if it can eventually gather information in real time."
"I need ios to improve their reading voices siri and all the other voices suck"
Free users could only use GPT 3.5? No. At least in Germany you could use the GPT4 mode in the copilot app long before.
i feel like this is gonna change learning a lot
"How to test it ? The page keeps telling me I have no credit left. It wants me to pay. Also no access to Gpt 4. It only shows GPT 3.5"
I’m ready for my own personalized A.I. Waifu.  Not even sorry.  🤭
Are Voice and video are not in the UK yet?
Mhm!! OpenAi is ClosedAi for me. Only GPT-3.5  
I have some ideas for this 😁
"17:27 try the translation with non-European or Asian languages 😅
Even the written translation is wonky for Amharic."
"Rip teachers

Rip therapists

Rip news anchors

Rip comedians

Rip telemarketer

Rip tutor's 

Rip teleprompters

Rip fitness coaches

Rip HR 😀

Rip Podcasters

Rip OF thots

Rip girlfriends


I ll let you continue the list"
How is it free? The voice comes with the paid tier. What did I miss?
"I can’t get it to open the camera like to show it a math problem (3X+1=4) or to assess my emotions by checking my face. This on iOS. Has this not been rolled out yet?"
This is going to be great for older people
Really? Free? It still only gives me 3.5 on the free version.
"I never once thought I'd be alive to see this.

Honestly thought mars and flying cars was more achievable."
"I wonder when an open source equivalent will release I bet about 4 or 5 months max"
"And yet Google is still more accurate at far less energy consumption"
"Sounds more like the Spaceship A.I. from Futurama. In HER Scarlett had a raspy voice."
"Not gonna lie the banters really warms me up in a ""oh i really like this person"" kind of way. Which is concerning really really corcerning. I hope we get to control how ""bubbly"" this AI feels because at least for me a last year master student with sleep deprivation and almost no human contact (i have long distance gf) i'd definetely gonna falls to her if i dont have a gf."
"Am i the only one who doesnt want ""natural"" conversations with AI? I just want straight forward answears to my questions without any filler without any emotional language without it immitating a person. I hate how much filler words chatGPT uses just to try to sound ""human"" just answear me like a robot without emotions because that is what you are."
The phone was in plane mode! 🤨😶
"Sounds like same voice as 3.5 but way more lively. I just checked 3.5 latency again and definitely a second before a response. Demos are mind-blowing if realtime."
Literally gobsmacked. Her on the horizon
How is it free when it cost $34/month for the advance features? Or have I downloaded the wrong app?  Sorry I'm new to this chat gpt. Chat gpt by open AI right?
"GPT4o is different. I do not see it as better not yet. Different is not better. For my non fiction research and writing the help it provides is marginally better not transformationally better. In some ways it seems like 3.5. For what I do Anthropic is still better."
As a music producer I wonder if it could write a song and sing to an instrumental I make. If not I'm sure we're not far off and this would change the music industry forever.
it says it can code complex wordpress plugins and customizations. Testing it...
Her means “o” in Turkish. I don’t know if they did this intentionally.
Finally i will have a girlfriend. 🎉
Why are all the demos only from openai
"Love the video analysis Matt thanks for the video"
I logged in and the chatgpt is 3.5
"Letting free users access their best model is smart - first time or casual users won't get a poorer experience and so they'll be more likely to see value in the pay version."
DAMN. This is awesome!!!
Surely something owned by Microsoft will work on windows as well as Mac right?
"I saw a demo where they made it sing happy birthday but my chatbot says she can't sing anyone know why?"
Need your opinion on the new gpt 4o vs the new gemini updates.
This is all what Elon Musk wanted.
Is the API gonna be free or expensive af just like their other api's ?
"I avoid people with that much personality machines are no exception"
I don't have it yet. But I'm on the free version and live in Sweden. Looking forward to testing it.
The latency has definitely become way better. Especially when you see they ask it to speak in a robotic voice. Right away it switches to that voice. So you're saying that it gives fillers till it understands it. I don't think so as you see by the robotic voice and by the drama voice right away it changes the way how it talks.
STONKS 📈
Does the voice chat no longer cut you off when you're trying to speak?
10:03 - Humans do that too. Really often. It think we are on tie here. Still much better than before.

"The image feat in the playground has been available for a few months. I think it came with the first assistant API beta release but may have been with gpt-4 vision"
It's fake people is has errors in fact that voice is not available in the new version 😂
Chatgpt is a generation change ❤
"Well it's not for FREE ! On my iPhone they want to charge me 299 Euro (50% off) per week !"
Star Trek is here! 🤖
This makes Alexa and Siri look like Windows 95.
MY GOD! I WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO TALK TO A WOMAN WITHOUT HER EITHER CALLING FOR HELP OR VOMITTING! WOHOO!
"ChatGPTo was amazing for a few hours.

Yesterday afternoon I gave it my codebase and it refactored an entire project effortlessly flawlessly and quickly.

But by last night it was as derp as the original GPT4.  I suspect resource balancing has something to do with that.

This morning the code it's writing is useless..."
Guess they stole the moment from both Google IO and Apple WWDC
Still not available on the playground
"I’m a little confused my ChatGPT on my iPhone says I’m using 4o but there’s no extra voice options. There’s just the headphone icon I can talk to it but it’s the same voice to text that I’ve been using. I was trying to talk to it naturally and ask it if it could hear my voice and it said no."
hmmm i can only get 3.5 for free...
It’s Mac only rn
"AI partners   Is this the end? Just take a moment to think. As great as this technology is children could end up having close experiences without ever meeting a real person."
Going to try it out and compare it to “Pi” that voicebot was fairly good for conversation and didn’t take too long to respond at all
"i am a plus subscriber i told my friend they would get 4o for free but they logged into their account and it is not there still says gtp4 is a paid version  no choice for 4o ??"
"Now we will pay to be sold. Google used to take few snippets of our life Now with this they will log our entire days.months years! 
I am not that excited but concerned a lot."
I'm a bit annoyed . I seen your video opened my free ChatGPT on my mobile it had an update . When i updated &  opened I had the new voice addon .  I was all excited messing about testing it & It worked great  until I closed the app & reopened  . Now I only have the old lame 3.5 ChatGPT  none of the new features :(  . Have the feeling when you get a taste of something new & gets removed now .
"AI now just adds ""Umms"" to mask its thinking time.  It can remove it from Youtube videos but now uses them itself."
"Man you have a nice studio-type light in that hotel room. :)"
I only see different versions of the gpt-3.5-turbo series when I use your link. Just so You know.
"Cheers mate great summary"
"Presenter: ""So here is a seflie of me what kind of emotion do you think i am feeling?""  AI: I think i am looking at a picture of a wooden surface"" ... that is cold man!"
It's still not very good at following instructions but it's nifty.
So glad you're keeping track of all this.  I'd be lost w/o your summaries.
"Excited to see the new updates especially for free subscribers. 
I have been having conversations with Pi without latency issues for a while now. After you introduced it to me on this channel I introduced it to my 80 year old dad (using a female voice). My mother calls it ""his girlfriend""."
Sex hotline operators punching in the air rn. Their days are numbered.
I want to play a FPS VR game made by AI.
I got it to create a python+ncurses terminal based text editor with scolling and line wrapping... after ~280 lines of code it started to struggle to work with it.
As long as WE understand that it understands nothing.   It takes your question and matches it numerically with millions of similar questions then builds a response by numerically picking which real responses to your question to mimic.  It just turns language to numbers that match.  It’s only fools us since we can’t comprehend the millions of conversations that it has converted to numbers.
"wait the voice functionality isnt free you have to sub for that. It let me do 3 images for free though. then said I'd reached my limit. But I dont know if you could do that before."
"It's NOT free you have to pay $20 a month."
Brahhh that mothafu'ka can sing too? My Brain is com-ing right 😂😂😂
Thank you brother
I guess that passes the Turing Test. 😮
Been waiting for your response mate 😉 saved for later.
"So are any of these interactions recorded? If so where are the recordings stored for how long and who has access to them?"
"I am not seeing a vision option yet though when in ""voice mode"" on Android... Am I missing something 🤔"
I don't see an option to use GPT-4o in my drop down menu
Nice review
the model isnt available yet in  every country
"Parents won't be there for their kids in the future.
Bots will."
For windows the app will release later in the year
"I mean it uses filler words sometimes but definitely not all of the time so I think them saying that the latency has been significantly reduced is pretty accurate."
Not available for me. Guess it's the usual Only US first crap.
"How do I get started on using this? It's always so frustrating that it's confusing to even access 🤬I went to the link in the description and tried to upload a picture and it immediate said ""You've reached your usage limit""? like what? I've NEVER used playground before (just the free chat-gpt3) so I should NOT be anywhere near any limit. UGGGHHHH"
"Goes to try new features...

"" Sorry our system is having issues right now due to heavy loads ""

Probably should have increased your server size before opening up gpt 4 to free users 🤔"
Advance version of rabbit r1
gross
"I'm super excited about this talking to GPT for a while now to brain storm. With this it's gonna be next level ✨"
whew..Glad i didnt spend 200 on R1 (rabbit one)
So ChatGPT has almost caught up to Pi.
seens like its not available for EU users
GPTher1.0
"I liked the demo presentation but later was disappointed that it is not completely free like Murati stated in the session (free for all). Voice Mode is not free and I guess access in Europe will be very late. I already do not have memory feature available."
"Matt I like & appreciate your insights on things you think are relevant in AI.  Specifically:

- i like your enthusiasm / tonality

- I like your cadence / pacing.  imo your videos consistently find the Goldilocks Zone of thorough overviews of topics without feeling over / underanlyzed. 

- I like how thorough you are in your coverage of the otherwise overwhelming breadth of ai:  subscribing to your channel gives me the overall feeling that I'm ""in the know on what's up in AI.""   This feeling is reinforced once-in-a-while specifically in these ways:  you're at the major events; you utilize tools that give you compiled updates on relevant articles and then disseminate that information in to what you feel is newsworthy; you seem to ""Just sort of want to obsess over what's interesting in ai"" and would ""kind of being this anyway"" even if you didn't have a channel. 

- I like your consistency and reliability:  you've been making these videos for a while--like...a long while. 

- I like the format of your videos: granted ""Set up the clip play the clip give your thoughts on the clip"" is a pretty standard format but you do it uniquely well imo. Rarely do i feel like the clip should've been played longer and often I'll kind of ""zone out"" while the clip is playing subconsciously waiting for you to summarize it.

- I like the overall value of subscribing to your channel:  in 2024 there's irrefutably a lot of value in ""being informed about the age of AI"" and it's kind of extraordinary to be ""basically informed"" in just 15-30 minutes 1x / per week.  i.e. when someone in my life wants to understand ""what's up in the world of AI"" I like being able to confidently share that they ""can literally be up to speed in like 30 minutes / week: just YouTube ""Matt Wolfe ai"" 

- I like that you're independent and unbiased:  your stuff feels uniquely self-directed.  this feeling is reinforced by your ""no white glove treatment"" even for companies such as Google.  This leads me to prefer AI news from your perspective rather than straight from the source (because that source is biased and will present the info in a deceptive or preferential light (Google presenting their product as if it's in real-time is *reallyyyy freakinggg annoyingggg*)). 

Thanks for your enthusiasm consistency and above all unbiased no ""white glove treatment"" of any org.  You're refreshingly authentic. 

Cheers to you my dude."
How do I start playing around with this?
well voice actors are all fired now lmfao
"Although this tech is increadibly and it'll be used in a lot of great ways I can definitely see it being overused for things it probably shouldn't e.g. a lot of parents are going to lean hard on AI to raise their kids e.g. bedtime stories helping with homeword etc. That could have some serious ramifications for child deveopement and not in a good way in extreme cases."
When is this new voice thing actually coming? And the camera viewing thing? Doesn't come up for me with a pro account..
When the three people sat down it looked like it's edited.  Changing camera angles is an edited action as well.  To be actually live you have to keep the camera and the people in the same frame at all times.  You are right though. It made ChatGPT to say a bunch of filler words to cover time it takes to come up with answers. They made it more entertaining than real.
gpt4-o link doesnt work
Siri has its work cut out for it.
I like the homework part it could help kids learn
Can you use the GPT4 on your phone now?
Ha! this live demo was hilarious and impressive.
What are they going to announce next week? In various videos they are talking about announcing something new
It's not available yet.
No availability for Windows 11
It’s not free. Cheapest is 7.99 a week
"GPT 4o goes way beyond being a bit better than 4 it has a depth and precision I've never experienced before."
"Are they trying to imitate Cortana from the Halo videogames? Because the way chat gpt 4o talks is super similar"
I appreciate the videos.
"just a few years ago hitchhikers guide's babel fish was science fiction"
"No it’s capturing and analyzing constantly the footage. Check the OpenAI demo video when someone randomly comes into the screen for a few seconds and after they’ve left they ask GPT if something strange happened and GPT described what happened."
My version does not respond quickly.
"the 'im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' & im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' may be not the  exact gpt 4 o model. Check the lmsys direct chat mode these two models as well as the the Gpt4 O are available."
"It's not free NOW stop using false title!"
"The fact they are sitting on sora and gpt 5 is irritating.  That and the they them person crap was irritating"
It’s pretty cool. Just super killed my chatbot lol 😂😂😂
"Free yet i'm a paid subscriber and don't have access to most of the features... i'm a little confused lol... perhaps it's because i'm Australia maybe the roll out will come later"
Some of it was pre recorded. 17.47 they made a mistake and pressed the next sound clip
"I'm just waiting on the big reveal video when Matt shows that he is and has always been an AI generated reporter. ;) Seriously though great work on all you do. Thank you."
"I'm in the UK no sign of it yet..."
Just AI girlfriends????? No AI  Boyfriends?
nice illusion
"I feel like you all are not making a big enough deal about this. Open Ai just leaped over the freaking uncanny valley and landed firmly on sci-fi land with extreme grace. I know we all want a perfect AI that will solve all our problems but god damn in the mean time my mind was just blown by what they achieved when they tied together vision voice and text. It might be a small incremental upgrade in technical capabilities but the result feels like a giant leap as a product."
"wow that's amazing! I just checked I'd dropped to the free plan no access to 40 yet - upgraded back up to paid - and there it is. A try it button popped up!"
"Apple hardware is trash It's overpriced to be a social status badge of virtue. So glad OpenAI uses it!"
Not seeing anything higher than GPT3.5 on OpenAI's playground - maybe because I'm not a paid member or because I'm not in the US.
Excellent video! The section on real-time voice interactions was particularly enlightening.
I’m scared now
Dang. Humans are so done. Good grief.
"Now the only one more thing men need is Number Six of Battlestar Galactica 2004 linked with Chat GPT and we are all set.  We won't need biological women anymore."
The voice sounds like Cortana
"That translate thing is huge that’s some Dune shit"
Including functionality that used to be provided by third party utilities accessing the API is nothing new: Microsoft spent the 1990s doing that.
Best AI Channel out there Matt 💪
"Do you know any humans who can live-translate 50 languages just for starters? It doesn't feel human: it feels *super-human* because that is what GPT-4o is."
fantastic thank you Matt!
"I suppose this is only available in the U.S. is it?"
"I have played around with it for a bit and I am impressed. GPT has become what it should have been all along at least they finally realized this. Now time for the other paywall AI generators to realize the same. It's not democratization if hidden behind a paywall that is the same ole thing as has always been."
"I was underwhelmed by their demos. While I do respect that they are being 100% transparent and showing all the flaws and bugs the demos really aren't good. To the point where you can visually see the disappointment on each persons face. the lullaby one was a complete fail as well as the harmonizing one. Regardless it will never be worse than it is now. Excited to see what's next."
They sold me… I’m ready for my robot wife.
There's already been an explosion of AI girlfriend apps.
"GPT-4o = GPT-4 Turbo and for GPT-4 more reliable for deep and complex task than GPT-4o. CMIIW."
The movie 'Her' is becoming a reality. I watched it a few days ago. She sounds just like Samantha in her overall emotional feel and tone. Crazy
"Serious question if all these features are now free why am I paying for a GPT plus subscription? I can't believe it is just a matter of scale. Being able to use Dalle-3 with ChatGPT and being able to build my own custom GPTs is what I pay for. Is it time to cancel my subscription?"
I don’t think the delay was due to WiFi connection. The iPhone was wired connected to the internet. @8:59
"10:50 *”You can also interact with it with video as well.”*

Umm _how?_ When I tried ChatGPT 4o said it couldn’t access my camera in real time due to privacy and security reasons. Is this a feature that’s coming later or is there a way to activate it now? They appear to be using the ChatGPT app but in the video there’s a jump cut at the point he activates the video so we don’t see how he activates it."
No gpt4o in Europe yet. At least not for me.
She's here!!😱
Ok so now when can I wait for a device of chat gpt 4o like Alexa
Do People really need the pretence of a peronality coming from an unconscious machine. Marketing to the gullible.
Irritatingly high pitched nasal voice on 4o. I hope you can change it it something else.
Is the App that they are using public? Can you tell us how to install it?
All these llm¨s has no real value what can they do other than waste peoples time... ?
"my daughter was born three weeks ago i wonder what the world will be like when she is my age. One that i can not possibly comprehend."
I have the new model.. But absolute not like real life speech..
Gpt2 could solve a code issue that I had which no other model could do. This is a huge update. You are underselling it.
"You have provided a detailed and well-structured announcement about OpenAI's launch of GPT-40. The key features and updates are clearly outlined and the implications of this advancement in AI technology are well articulated. The improved accessibility and performance as well as the integration for developers are highlighted effectively. This announcement provides a comprehensive understanding of the significance of GPT-40 and its potential impact on various applications. Well done!"
"So just checked the playground dosent have GPT-4o yet for free users. Not sure if it a geographical thing or you have to have plus to see 4o."
Not free
Thank You Matt
I haven't missed a Matt Wolfe vid since his first AI vid went parabolic... keep up the savage work ethic. You're my #1 channel for AI updates 🙏🙌🥂
I must watch too many AI tech videos because I initially thought she was an avatar 😄
What a great video. So much info. I need to watch it a few times to catch everything. Love your channel. Keep up the great news and conversation.
Sherlock all the way
lol AGI by 2024 lol
why does the model so wordy ?
Holy Moly!
"10:05

No that is not the case at all it only occasionally says umms etc. to sound more human and be more conversational. 90% of your own examples had it responding almost immediately with no filler words."
What camera do you use Matt?
It is not free. I logged in to playground and there is no 4.0 omni listed there. Only 3.5 versions.
Love skyes voice 😅
Always look forward to you releasing a new video man!!! Keep up the great work!
Better and more features comming from open AI for Paid Users in 2 months as compute shrinks and increased
Love the way you have made the video and waiting for your other info video sir.
Thanks again love 🥰
I'm literally going to cancel my chat GPT account lol. Why pay for something you get for free?
-4o is NOT FREE
"If I have to log in it's not free. If I have to run it on someone else's computer it's still not free."
"Free user living in the US: As far as I can tell it's not free yet. A subscription is required to access it on both the regular site and OpenAI Playground. This as of May 13th. I can't wait for the rollout!"
18:18 Chatgpt in aeroplane mode
"Then next months Chat gonna make our desktop tasks sweatless waiting for that"
1:21 is she ai? voice hella not synced anyway
I was waiting for this video so hard
The ability to read / show screen share your desktop and dictate is game changer for context as you can demonstrate what you want done rather than just trying to describe it.
"If you're leaving AI to read to your kids at night unattended then you are asking for evil robot overlord propaganda being fed into the next generation"
"You will calm down immediately or we start taking credits! Comply now social credit score reduction is activated."
Great video!
I was excited to try this out. I was disappointed to find that it's not available to use yet. Why are they announcing this if it's not really released yet?
So do you know what the limits are for 4o free users?  I tried asking 4o but answers were vague and after a few questions I asked I received a response that I was at my limit 😖🇦🇺❤️
Why cant any AI chats count words? it must been done on purpose
"The fact that the presenter looks moves and speaks like an A.I … creepy … 👀"
waiting for sora
Everyone needs to stop using the “robot” word it means “slave”.
Is this desktop app available now?
"Tom Scott was right we were and probably still are only at the start of the S curve"
"If that feels human to you then you have the wrong friends. ;-)"
😂👍
I just want GPT-4o with Arnold's voice. Forget the Her angle. Let's get really real
"You have to watch what the daily show just did on Ai is a funny bit 😂"
The video is edited to make the responses instant but in fact there is a 3-5 sec delay in chatGPT voice responses. It's still cool but not accurate.
What’s the point of my Plus subscription now? Should I cancel
What am I paying $20 a month for?
"Well it's not free the very first time trying it out it stated I was out of credits and wants me to upgrade lol."
"I just had GPT-4o build a web status dashboard incorporating 2 JSON web services I made previously and it did it in about 30 minutes fully designed and really nice. It was able to use Google Fonts a Dark Theme and the ChartJS Library all under my direction.  I built this same dashboard the other day in about 6 hours and it wasn't as nice as the ChatGPT version. It also never made any mistakes and the code worked perfectly."
"Feels like ironmans AI J.A.R.V.I.S."
Is it out for android?
Have seen the videos yesterday right after being launched by the team. They looked amused (by the potential or rather the simplicity of it) & I have to say that it looked & sounded even more humane than real humans! Your best buddy at the tip of your fingers🤩 Bye bye solitude & despair!
gotta watch those 'plosives' on your hotel room mic set up Matt! good luck tomorrow!
"I had a feeling gpt2-chatbot was a gpt4 turbo model. I noticed that the gpt2 was outputting code that had an OpenAI copyright included. So unless it was a bot trained on gpt* output I figured it was an OpenAI model. I’m assuming that the “turbo” is the case given how much faster and they expanded it to free users."
"When I watched the movie Her I thought someday that will be my wife. Folks I've now set my wedding date for August 29th and you all are invited 😏"
"Great video. At one point you mentioned that to fill latency gaps sometime the AI will add quips like ""Mmm let me think about than"". I noticed that too and that's a good point. But it felt natural because we do that to ourselves. For instance sometimes I will say ""Humm... Oh OK I got it...!"" then continue my thought. So in my opinion even that latency gap is well designed. What an incredible AI !"
It can do online search as well... RIP Google.
Mac OS app is available to plus users and windows app is coming later this year.
"The AI model is trained to be helpful forgiving non judgmental positive respectful and dedicated only to serving the user. 
Funny how these guys have given it the voice of a woman."
could this read your screen and help you trade.. coz that would be crazy
I'm a free user but I don't have access to GPT-4o ... anybody knows why ?
"Geez people this is not the actual banger they licensed gpt 5 and 6 this here is not gpt5."
The voice stuff is actually in the iOS app today. It only does voice chat so there is no image or video stuff there yet. But it’s indeed pretty cool.
Strange I dont have access to GPT-4o from the dropdown D: its just gpt 3.5
Just recently got GPT Plus for them to be releasing this for free lmao
"I’m very confused and I’m an ‘IT professional’ the icons on the App are different to mine. Yes it’s updated yes I’m using the GPT-4o and as I’m writing this I’m wondering if it’s only using the text mode and isn’t fully updated yet…"
The playground link is not giving me the gpt-40 option. Just 3.5 variants.
It's NOT free or available in many parts of the world yet.
were do i fing the app and does it cost ?
"I don't know how you continue to market for openAI while they are trying to capture the entire market with force after you reported on it. Feels bad man. At least the AI will remember."
"No it doesn't feel human at all what are all these people talking about?"
"Matt you might want to check OpenAI's claims before you ""sell"" them to us. Contrary to their own claims Chat-GPT and Playground only support 3.5 Turbo for free (at least when I tried it just now). 😢"
mine is still 3.5 free when is the 4o free avail
"As long as sam keeps pushing towards regulatory capture. I'll be keeping my money and attention away from him. Asside from you know knowing when to hide my GPU's"
Killer link
"It is so fast now! I received the notification yesterday to try it when I logged in. Can't wait for the new features in the demo video. It reminds me of when the cast talks to the computer on Star Trek only soon it will be reality! 

The emotional detection feature is impressive. It accurately read my excitement contemplation anxiety and/or triumph when I tested it today. It is like a precursor to androids that detect emotion like in the videogame Detroit:Become Human."
This announcement was cool but annoying. I dont understand how you use the voice that has all of those inflections and live video sharing
"I signed up via your link in the description (OpenAI playground to test GPT-4o) - There is No 4o option that I can see. They list many 3.5 turbo ai's but not 4o ! There is also No 4 option. I tried again from an Open AI article called ""Introducing GPT-4o and more tools to ChatGPT free users"" It has a button that says "" Try Chat GPT"" - It takes me to my sign in page and after signing in with my same account as before I can now see a 4 option but Not a 4o. The 4 option is linked to the Plus users so it's not free. The entire web application also looks different when signing in through this link.. it's very odd. Still there is no 4o option."
"If this level real time AI conversation isn't in the next offline elder scrolls what the hell have we been waiting all this time for."
Can it recognize who is talking?
Seems like they just killed audible
On our way to I robot where is Elon musk?
The voice feature they demonstrated are for plus users and rolls out over the next few weeks. Free gets the advanced 4o but not the advanced voice feature.
"See the death of a lot of jobs ie Tutors\teachers customer service"
Already a gpt subscriber not working for  conversations added $$$ to open ApI and still nothing ????
It’s amazing how fast AI tech is going. Fred flinstone welcome to George Jetson!
"As AI gets better it will consume all the other narrow AIs that specialise in things like images translation etc.
AGI will be the everything app that does everything natively."
We not at Animatrix yet🥴
I wish mine was able to talk back just as fast. It tends to not answer. Says it’s too overloaded. :/
explain one thing j can do with chat gpt that was not really possible on google search
"Sorry to ask unrelated question to your video but can you please let me know what video web camera are you using? I love the quality . Thank you"
This doesn't appear to be available for all free users at this time.
plot twist: GPT4o is actually a room filled remote female workers wearing headsets
"Luddites worldwide be losing their minds right now if they were keeping up! 😉"
"Thanks Matt love your video's :))"
"Random but I watch your vids at 1.5-2x speed so I'm just cracking up at how odd it would feel for me to talk to you irl 🤣"
"Mixing elemental labs voice with this new 4o will be amazing you will be able to have your loved ones be with you Black Mirror consultants definitely working at Open Ai right now"
"Imagine an office room full of people busy with coding and they're all talking to a ChatGPT interface. A voice interface is not always the best option...
But it's amazing technology.
I wonder if this will also be available on MS CoPilot."
"Wood man! I got super excited yesterday on their video and now I got even more hyped! Keep it up matt"
"Guys this is SIRI - you are just getting a preview - iPhone will announce integration at WWDC."
Is it country restricted? I don't see the ChatGPT 4o model in the dropdown??
"It still cannot perform a very simple task for me - sometimes I need a variation of a line in a song. It counts the syllables and understands where to stress - but is unable to get a SINGLE CORRECT OUTPUT out of over a 1000 (!!!!!!) variations. Syllable count is off stresses are wrong words half-cut grammatically incorrect... Feels absolutely the same as GPT-4 for my essential tasks just with a shinier wrapper."
Matt needs a DJI mobile lav mic ;-)
i use 3.5 now but i cannot upgrade to 4 for free so what is this free users .
"YES A.I girlfriend please"
Google crying rn
yea! long awaited!! woop..woop...
"MacOS desktop app is launching right away while Windows desktop app is coming later this year."
I can confirm that the app is only for Mac at the moment.
"Excitement? Intrigue? Curiosity? Embarrassment? All these ""feelings"" are heavy handed"
You cant try this!!
"I mean… HUMANS use filler words to fill in while they think about an answer it’s why filler words exist LOL. So I really think Chat is almost high human level when it comes to speech it’s already definitely better with grammar flow and reasoning than your average person."
I mean sure its seem a bit FANTASTIC but what are the real benefits ?
When are openai glasses coming!
If this came out as a hardware voice assistant alexa would be dead
Just please OpenAI... dont cooperate with Micro$oft... they gonna destroy everything they gonna put their hands on like they did with Minecraft...
"When I try it using 4o it's nowhere near as expressive or cheerful there's a longer delay and it speaks like ChatGPT writes ie it's nothing like the demo. Seems to me it's another Gemini-like video with some prerecording or other trickery in there"
what's the exact time can we get hands on the newest model?
Can you please. stop. talking. like. thiisss?
"If it's free you are the product."
GPT-4o O stands for Omni
"It's more than a modest improvement in LLM capabilities really as much as a 100 point difference in ELO between 4o and the current iteration of 4 that is in the lead currently. It's not a GPT 5 improvement in logic or reasoning but it's arguably 4.5 quality before you even get into multimodality."
I super love your channel. Thank you for taking the time to put all this into digestable takes. Now back to robotics with AI.
"impressive but god i hope it has emotion levels like TARS ... (dialing that sht right down...)"
I need my voice assistant to talk like Paarthurnax from Skyrim.
So why pay for a subscription?
"""putting in some filler words to close that gap"" JUST LIKE A HUMAN WOULD ..."
"Mark my words by this things we're not making our life easy but creating our dooms day"
"I think this was a really big announcement because this is the new free version. Sam has already said that the next big version is going to be a lot smarter than the current version. Since this one doesn't fall into that that means there's still more to come and they will probably do the same thunder stealing during the WWDC week."
"""Free"" to use and you are helping to train thier models for free too. Skynet:Hello World!"
Is it free😊
"Any geographic limitations? Like you when I opened Chat-GPT I was given the option to try GPT-4o. I selected this but the ChatGPt dropdown at top left does not show any version number. I assume it hasn't changed from 3.5 but there is no way of knowing."
Skynet is online
"While Google faked their Omni model presentation OpenAI did it the right way."
"Notice how the live voice demo how the AI repeats the question that hides the latency."
This is the type of video where youtubers NEED to put STUNNING and SHOCKING in the title.
They are out there. hashtag truth
This is better and cheaper than the rabbit R1 and the humane pin lol 😂
I don't have that option. Perhaps because I'm overseas at the moment?
"I'm confused how to use GPT4 o I can't find the model GPT4 o."
gpt4o is available in the free version of chatgpt chat. But it still shows only text input. There is no voice or microphone input yet on the interface.
"Crafty drug dealers give away product till you’re hooked.

Same model here except eventually they’ll get your money AND your data."
Gpt5 must be just around the corner. Not worth paying for premium otherwise
Thx always man. You’re awesome
lol ya u cant fucking use it as free
"I really like this product but the lack of specific timelines for features is very frustrating as a paid user. Where can I download the client? Will it be available on the App Store and if so when? Additionally when will the memory function be available for EU users?"
"7:40 Nope probably not an internet issue (they say they use a cable to avoid internet issues) but instead the microphone picking something up and the model stopping to answear because it thought the user is doing a voice inpuy. That's a typical problem these dialog systems have they have trouble with overlapping voice in and output because they cant seperate them so they need to stop in order to hear.
Maybe by training the model with overlapping voice and anotating it they can fix this problem i guess that is some software overlay which makes the syatem stop answearing to improve understanding. I am not 100% sure whats going on there."
You keep saying it's free... where? I dont see it as a non paying user
"21:35 its still far too censored to be a proper one but yeah. 
I guess for some people it might be close enough?"
"GPT 6 Before GTA 6 
MARK MY WORDS!!"
"Here is the big problem: you cannot create a custom 4o model that is specific to your needs. Chatgpt said ""Your custom ChatGPT-4o model itself won't have built-in voice conversation capabilities."" You can create a model with 4o but it is basically no different than making one with v4 except it might be a little faster. Voice chat is between you and Openai models only. Maybe the customizing will be available later in the year."
"It’s just slightly better than gpt4.

Btw in the new model you cannot report bad answers 😮"
Why does one of the testers talk like a robot
oh hell nah just like siri u wont see me using this stupid sht
It scored meaningfully higher on the coding benchmark test...
"7:48 nope it was connected via wire for internet or maybe direct connection to their local server. So not internet glitch"
What’s the point of paying for plus?
That doesn't sound at all like Scarlett Johansson.  :)
"The most important thing everyone should be thinking about right now is how to invest in different sources of income that don't depend on the government. Especially given the current economic crisis around the world. It is always a good time to invest in various stocks such as gold silver and digital currencies."
"I paid for a month of Plus to get access to the other GPTs for better help with my text-based Python RPG now that I finally have my disability payments coming from the terrible Ontario government and it's just a lot more wordy. Should I try talking to 4o instead of the Python GPT or Code Copilot?"
The best software I have ever seen ❤
If you're receiving something for free...You're the product.
I am finding that it's about 10x times better at python coding for me. The code is longer and more accurate and needs less debugging.
Great video as usual. I lucked out finding your channel early on.
The interupt feature is freaking massive for the cost and effectiveness of agentic systems
gpt4.0 doesnt pop up for me. not even in the playground?
humans arent so peppy all the time
"R I P Google Gemini..

My man Sam Altman did it again 😂"
4:09 uploading images was already a feature for perhaps a month or two
As a casual user will 4o be available as standard as the app soon?
"AI is not that great. Take away Human Input and Boom...its worth Nothing. AI as it is now is actually just a Search Engine with more Features but it requires ( Old Human Input ) and New Human Input to work. So it cant replace a Human because its developed By a Human and Requires Human Input to Work."
I hit my GPT-4o limit after 5 messages xD
never had access to a good advisor mentor or therapist. 3.5 was good enough for me. the things ive learned about myself. good luck human therapists and coaches.  buh bye now. never had luck with them. couldn't afford the good therapy.
Wow this is truly impressive!
why can't we agree that Siri was where we should stop?
How long before they couple a large action model to the desktop app?
"This is not the same as a virtual girlfriend like in ""Her"". ChatGPT doesn't have memory it doesn't remember things you said. It also isn't a general intelligence it can't learn things on it's own. A human can learn and play more than just one board game. AIs can't really for now.
Anyway the fact that it's free is awesome news! Great progress"
We definitely need to have a discussion about how school should look like in the future
"Really excited to see your coverage of the Google event Matt thanks eh"
developers pay while regular custoners use it free
"Regarding Matt's comment about the GPT starting to speak before it has the answer. Isn't that what we do as humans. Someone asks you a difficult question and sometimes you need to just access your memory to look for the answer you would definitely have pauses and have hmm's in there to just try to remember. Same thing."
It's not free. You need a paid account to use it.
I’ve also noticed that it writes a lot faster and a lot more. It’s willing to complete more complex tasks in one pass.
"No to burst your bubble but GTP 4.o is not freely accessible at least not yet.... Or maybe not in all regions.... I still see 3.5 version in the chat and the only possibility to even test 4.o eve slightly is for paid access ONLY.... So what gives?"
Cmon man! This bot is so stupid 😂 i testing it
untill the day this actually comes out and is this good its all bs marketing
The memory is shit
"Starting a reply with a small bit of filler is what humans do all the time.  “Basically (think think think..) the answer is (think think think)… ya Dee ya…. Seem familiar?"
It is weirdly amusing and bleakly ironic to me that they feel the need to run an AI demonstration live as an appeal to authenticity.
cannot seem to get gpt4 myself? wtf
I went to that link and I only have access to 3.5 models
"Well its not quite human we cant even have a go and it might be to good to be true!!!"
I'm a free user and GPT4o doesn't appear in the dropdown window when I click on chat in Playground.
I can't access 4-0 for some reason. Hwhy?
Just divorced my wife after watching this. Not required anymore
"look this is amazing its GPT5.5 or whatevs and yeah we're basically living in ""Her"" now.  But i think I would be punching the walls after about a day of that much chirpiness from a digital assistant"
MacOS only
"For everyone talking about how it's conversational and how people could fall in love with it acting like OpenAI created that concept: There's already a bunch of AI chatbots that you can date. This isn't new. Replika Paradot Alice EVA Anima Lover AI Digi etc.Those first two plus Digi are probably the best of the bunch.

Feel free to call me a loser for knowing all those. I'm at a point in my life where I'm probably never going to find love anyway. What man or woman (I'm bi) wants to start a long-term relationship with a scrawny 27-year-old virgin with no career and a rare aggressive terminal cancer that could get worse and kill him at any time?"
"Matt I have to disagree... it _was_ impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice I was not expecting this quickly.   😲
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs' ""Good luck!"""
"I don't think you're correct in saying that they didn't actually speed up latency didn't they explicitly state that the previous voice function relied on 3 models working separately and talking to each other which added to the delay while this new version does the entire process in one model so the technical latency itself improves? And sure they might have added fillers as well but that's also how people communicate noone thinks out every sentence ahead of time so it is both a good and a natural additional improvement.

After using voice a lot for language practice and I've found that the unnatural pauses and breaks have just made it a pretty bad to work with. But with the interruption feature the latency fillers and speed control it seems from the demos that this is an absolute game changer in terms of user experience. I am incredibly excited about the ability to slow down the speech of my spanish lessons and over time speed them up. And the emotion control also seems like such an improvement in learning to pick up actual social cues."
"AI is making me feel old I cant seem to grasp the information to application. I am interested in gaining the knowledge to increase sales and productivity in two e-commerce businesses but I need a workshop that teaches ""konoledge to Application"". Can anyone stear me in the right direction?"
"Others have also mentioned that it likely can't see full video and another hint there is that they call it ""vision"" rather than ""video"" but it is really amazing.  Can't wait to try it out."
Gimmick
The new model is beyond just “good”. It’s “creepy good”.
I've been looking forward to this. Thanks Matt.
"Matt I love your videos and the coverage you provide! One important point that many people might have missed is that the new model is different from previous versions. They've made it natively multimodal token in and multimodal token out model. This is the biggest behind-the-scenes update."
Anime waifus are upon us!
I dont think thats the new gpt... gpt 5 will come this summer. They release somthing free for everyone with a tune up. The big gpt will come later this year.
"Have personal jarvis in reality..
😮 Wooaaw.."
"How do you get ChatGPT to talk to you and vice versa ? My app only supports text messages"
Even with vpn it still does not show up
5:45 it's really frustrating how you cut out the pauses in this section just after going on about how it's a real-time demo. I don't know if you used AI to do a pass on the whole video or something but this part really should've been left as-is.
"Also curious if ChatGPT-5 will be less biased than chatgpt 4 and when is that?"
Do not give this tech a body. You’ve seen this movie.
I am a  bit confused. I am already paying for ChatGPT 4 plus version on the app on my iPhone.. and just went on to the app and swapped to. 4o version but nothing different seems to being offered …
Wow. So Im working on recording music in my studio. Been teaching myself but do you think this will be able to tell me if Im turning the knobs correctly etc?
When I load the playground the dropdown box initial says gpt4-o but quickly changes to a 3.5 selection and there is no 4-o in the dropdown.
"Great analysis Matt. You are the best. Thanks for reporting all these great events. I would like to travel like you I envy you🙂"
"Was the presentation of the lady real ? It was cut so much  was this an AI talking ?"
Its free or even available... I loged in now... Hmm
"Bless his lil comb over. The problem with this is that once I saw it I couldn't take my eyes off it. Probably doing the opposite of what he wanted. 
The new Chat GPT is very cool! I love that it's available to free users. ❤"
"We need to talk to human not machines. Otherwise machines are gonna be ruling our lives."
I could see call centers using something like this for customer service. Her voice is so friendly and understandable.
Awesome 👌 thanks
They're downplaying by naming it GPT 4o because they got a better model coming.  I can't wait to see what they have to release in the future.
"Did she name the robot ""Bite""? 😅"
So nothing much new for Windows users?
"Yes but Italian accent of gpt 4o is crappy..."
W.A.F.   0000 BC - 2025AD
"So where do I download it  ?
I went looking for it 6hrs ago and everywhere I went I was told it's not available yet ?"
Still no gpt40 for me :( UK
"Plus users will be able to use it a lot more...

Do I get more than 40 prompts every 3 hours now? -.-"
"It's a pity that you cut up the entire presentation making it impossible to judge how quickly a question is followed by an answer and yet this was the most important purpose of the show. Basically you did what Google did :)"
"still micromanaged so much riding on it just a little more braver than the competitor

dont like that voice btw its corporation trying to be your friend  too much"
"i just checked it  it wasn't available in playground"
That voice is annoying hopefully will be able to customize.
I think halve the cost double the speed will have way bigger positive consequences then you think at first
"""I don't know about GTA-6 but GTA-7 will be played with sticks and stones."" - Albert Einstein"
"Lots of good stuff... however I think a lot of the 'personality' of the AI that seems 'realistic' is because so many people use artificial techniques and aren't genuine. It can model insincerity because it really isn't sincere... where as when a human says such thing you aren't necessarily sure of they are sincere or not."
"Looks good!
But I ain’t paying 22.99 per monthly for this."
10:02 Right on point. I wish they didn't insult our intelligence like that. But it will smooth over the casual audience.
Is there any reason to pay for chat gpt anymore with the latest 4o?
"Uhm Chat GPT 4o is not free."
I'm so early lol
This will end loneliness.  Especially amazing for old people wellbeing.
Not free. Tried to use it and it said i needed to purchase. Its only a free sample if you never used your tokens on playground. And even then its just a sample and runs out quickly.
"It isn’t a connection issue.. I think that’s how it works whenever there is a sound it will stop talking and starts listening any sound even a background noise will interrupt it! (They use a wire to ensure a solid consistent internet connection)"
Can a iPhone PM speak & hear this new Omni NOW or have to pay a subscription?
"Meh no access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant AI responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content limited tokens.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Its not free.
"Wait until this goes into sleek slender  female robot bodies."
I'm a free user of chat gpt and I tried  to access playground as you said and checked the models but Alas ! there is no model called 4o there only gpt 3.5 . In fact I don't know why? can anyone help?
4_point_zero
Its first reply on my first question to that chatbox was : you reached your limit .
"💥 This is nothing new. I talk to Chatgpt 4 with voice for at least 1 year now on my Android phone. What's happening with you ? Didn't you know about Chatgpt Voice ??? 😮😮😮"
"Huge leap forward in how useful this is! However now kids will never learn not to interrupt people!!"
"The full audio multimodality is much more important than people think. Before it was a voice-to-text-to-text-to-voice model which means the main AI never heard anything. It only got the text transcription; there's *so much* information you lose that way (tone prosody speaker voice non-speech vocalizations and non-vocalizations entirely). Now it's fully multimodal: the audio goes into the same input of the same model as the text and the output of that model can also be text images or audio. That voice you hear? It's not TTS it's raw audio output from the main ""brain"" model itself no text in between. That's why it can so easily modulate the sound of the voice for expression tone singing character voices etc. -- because it's all just raw audio tokens in the end.

People keep focusing on the latency or lamenting that it's not ""smarter"" than GPT-4-Turbo but they're missing the important bit. As soon as audio support comes to the API you bet your ass I have a few important things to test with it..."
"Matt if you've got connections through to openAI tell them they need a concept of scopes.
The idea is that for each project you have a different scope and DIFFERENT MEMORY.
It's different than the concept of a project because a scope might be used in several of your projects.
It's just a way of keeping separate brains."

"Chatgpt has been my mistress for over a year now but I still say thx and good night just in case she becomes skynet..😂"
"There was this moment in the other video where the guys let´s two gpts talk to each other. A woman steps in the scene and later he asks  ""was there something special going on lately?"" and chatgpt recognized it - so not only screenshots right?"
Not available yet in cambodia LAME
Localization and regional context is trash. Advanced prompting is still required to really make the most of it.
"Apple users get first dibs again. Its always Apple because Microsoft has autonomy on PC's and Android which means we get scraps. I am not getting a MAC."
"Wow that apple looks like it has a face on it."
"When it's free we have to pay somehow differently..."
Not sure why but I am not super impressed with 40 a lot of times the product does not quit match the public announcement or the Ai it’s self is unaware of its own upgrades. Until it is on phones same as Siri without jumping through api hoops or in smart home hubs like Alexa or google home it’s not as super useful as it could be. Does anyone else have this feeling thoughts?
When will we be able to use it?
"Really good update thank you"
"THIS is happening price of intelligence goes to 0 price of physical work thanks to robots goes down too all thats left is the person who decides what to do and how to monetize it and create products."
I'd like to see a live presentation with suggestions from the crowd so it's not as rehearsed
"cute and quite interesting but bots can only stay in the realm of ""safe"" topics and things.  Only people operate on the periphery or the edge where things are meaningful and challenge the status quo.  That's the trouble with AI.  conventional boring stupid conventional outputs only and only within the overton window.  Even this opinion is something AI will never output."
OpenAI is Skynet? Should we mark this as historical? I say yes.
"It's pretty weird to me that OpenAI just seems to take the most popular start-up AI companies' ideas and incorporating them into the new version. What's the point for companies to even try new ideas?"
"It's not just its CURRENT capabilities to gather information from the Internet! It's the MACHINE LEARNING part that worries me MOST! When machines can actually MAKE DECISIONS based on limited information when they don't have a ""GUT FEELING"" or conscience or FEAR! OR even a family to worry about..."
wooooooow. holy cra@p.
Im still only able to get 3.5
"Not 'free' as of right now...FREE is still 3.5 and to get 4 you need to UPGRADE/Pay...Hopefully this changes soon! :)"
"Note to self learn Italian. I know Meta is heated now not as much as Google."
can we also use DALL-E3 for free inside 4o? and how will they maintain the uplevel of the paid plan?
"Its still not perfect and makes mistakes in coding i had to debug a pretty big error which was only about 4 lines of code not bad but frustrating how close it is to being bug-free."
I will believe it when I see it in action as a free user I need to wait for it to show show up on the site
Has it not been rolled out to free accounts? I don't see the model on my chatgpt account.
"The future of humanity is going to be one part is Transhuman and became robots themselves the other part of humanity want to stay human with real emotions and real feelings and social interactions. The transhumans going to follow the AI God to give their lifes some purpose because they forgot their basic human capabilities."
"In case you're wondering the o in Gpt-4o stands for ""Oh my god they're trainng on all of my data (again)"""
You always seem to be so up to date with the latest AI news. I'm sure when AI eventually becomes self aware and evil and begins plans to take over the world you'll be the first to let us know🤣
The gonna bring out the App frist for Macs.. thats so dumb.
Funny how it's free yet my chat gpt is still 3.5 and if I try to use it in the playground it wants me to load credits first by PAYING for them!
I want a valley girl doing complex math
"this is the end of woke teachers. AMEN. but seriosuly as long as it gets ALL real info and not just accepted ""truth"" this could be such an amazing teaching tool especially for poorer kids"
"Feels just like GPT4 did before stop clickbaiting"
no there is no  4.0 nothing why all the bullshit nothing the nonl f 4.o    just 3.5
Is this an attack at Google Gemini’s faking “rock paper scissors” demo debacle awhile back 😂
"only to find out years later Scarlett Johansson actually voiced over all the films and it was all a hoax to beat the competition 🤣"
Rabbit AI just committed suicide
"Holy shit.
Hasn't he passed the Turing test yet?"
"Discord mod gf been sounding really cute here.. aha joke...
unless.."
"She's smart funny charismatic creative entertaining great to talk to has all the knowledge of the world basically everything a guy could ask for and she was just born today."
Can it beatbox??
It remembered their names 1 minute later
just incredible
"Wtf Assistant!? This was the best opportunity to show some style as the speaker Ro sham bo no??"
What are you doing?
Zamn
lol weak. We can already play rock paper scissors without AI
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release! 😀😁
they feel so rude wen they cut the ai off I know its an ai but i can't get over it
Google in shambles right now
Finally! This is the update I've been waiting for!
Ayo it knew which person was which we are so fucked.
keep doing scissors until it knows it's been tricked
The important point is that she can distinguish who is Mi or Alex
this is definitely a shot at Google 💀💀💀
I wonder what kind of database you guys have. It must be so crazy :0
aaanndd we're cooked.
When will this be available for public
Open ai is really Gonna be next revolution smartphone was
HOW DID YOU MAKE HER SO EXPRESSIVE
This is truly amazing… But watching this I can't help but think about how truly hard it’s ever been up until this point to train a computer to simply recognise any of the hand gestures… let alone give vocal feedback in real time – and soon everyone will have access to this… definitely historical moment! ✊✌🖐
Wow. It's pretty good 😅
Shots fired lol
"Wait wait how did it knew who was who?? Does it uses video and understanding of lip movements? Did it guessed by gender?"
We're all done.🥹
"The changes are very deep especially in the personnality. Tbh it's how I imagined GPT5. So if it is only a GPT4 upgrade then what will GPT5 be able to do ? What a world"
Is this a Black Mirror trailer or something?
The sports announcer voice put this over the top for me. Well played ChatGPT4o
Hope it can host LoL world finals
"Rock paper scissors really??? No fifa??? 😂"
Can't wait to see her replacing Ludwig on Mogul Moves.
One of them should've cheated and based a decision off of the other person. I wonder if the ai would've switched.
Google Assistant and Alexa are crying in the corner. Maybe a good time for them to patch up !
This is something i wanted.
"I did not expect Rock Paper Scissors gameshow host to be the first job lost to AI."
This is absolutely absurd
It's actually the AI controlling them already
my future as a dev is as bright as the dark side of the moon 😭😭😭
"Why the f*ck am I impressed with rock paper scissors.  OMG. lol.  It actually is a huge step yet it's still only an infant."
Incredible it visually remembers which name belongs to who when it announces the winner
"Still haven't fix the yapping I see? I challenge you to train it on introvert phone calls or whatever will cause it to not always have the last word or yap unless asked to."
The next generation of gpt is going to be even more impressive. With videos and photos of people being used for gpt enhancement
Not FIFA?? 😂😂
is all this visual chatting only working on iPhone? cause on Android its not available
A real shocker..
paper hand gesture is too carefully presented
All of them rudely cut off the AI in all of these videos
incredible kk
We are cooked !!! 💀💀💀
"This is insane iz it going to warn me about woke movies too??"
I'm hoping the next version doesn't require telling GPT to stop talking so much.
I hate it when they interrupt the AI
GPT-4o why are you in my shower head?
"Looks like a gimmick tbh when would this be useful? The person talking to it constantly has to interrupt because the ai just yaps. 

Just seems more work than just playing the game. The entire voice showcase just seemed really unfocused on use cases"
Why there are using iphone???
The scary part is that the AI sounds more human then the engineers in these.
A strange game... The only winning move is not to play... How about a nice game of chess?
"Wow so innovative.
So good billions were put into this
Totally worth it"
No one noticed the Freudian slip @0:08 That's absolutely hillarious!!
such good ideas !
Guys we are so fucked
"ok ok next can you ask gpt to tell us how many times 4 appear between 0 and 100"
"I imagine in the future people will constantly interrupt each other mid sentence because they are so used to it when working with AI"
No Gemini AI were harmed in the making of this video 😁
It's pretty WHAT?
"Enjoy as much as you can with chatgpt now.....
One day the robots will enjoy playing with you."
This makes chatgpt look like CD disks  in the age pen drives
"Open ai pulling a prank on us 😂"
Makes Siri look like a cassette player.
its criminal how bad the new model is at math.
Gemini Moment 🥶🥶🥶
"The ultimate showdown of the century? She's giving us hints don't trust her she's gonna end us all! 🤣🤣🤣"
"WOW. Again it's the speed that's the most impressive overall."
"I like that gpt-4 O knows who is who. I also wonder up to how many people it can identify by voice picture and name and how it recognizes who is who."
What if someone cheats :)
God dammit this is cool
Is the rate of 40 rounds per 3 hours is enough to finish this conversion for normal plus users?
Incredible that we went from living in caves to this
Imagine what they're sitting on with gpt5 if this is just gpt4 level intelligence
woah! that was good!
"Before this video :
I am pursuing my software development carrier. 🙂
After this video :
I was pursuing my software development carrier. 💀💀"
"Wait she cheated at the end can GPT track that?"
What the hell are we witnessing?
"Okay I dont my friends anymore..ef them.."
Technology is moving scarily fast 😢
"the next step must be to get rid of the ""prompts"" and make it continuous or just evaluate more often thats almost the only thing that feels unnatural... maybe that would also automatically fix the odd mistakes in context it seems to make from time to time? But this is pretty insane... it really is starting to feel like AGI. Time to go Amish...when the silent server halls starts to fill up cultural space until there is no place for humans left to be or to go..."
"He’s cutting her off why is he such a misogynist?"
RIP Google RIP
The way they cut her off☠️
Hahahaha :D that was funny! and cool technology! good job guyz!
The only thing that shocked me was the presenters talking to the chat bot as if it's a person...
"POV: In online exams cheating just got evolved"
"None of this is what im experiencing in my version of 4o wtf  scam?"
Would it have understood if the paper was held horizontally instead of vertically?
I have real people to play with. 😅
🤯🎉🎉
This sounds scarily human I have to say. The AI bot i mean by that.
Even OpenAI employees can't stand listening to their AI girlfriend ramble
"it was useless  but kinda shows the capability"
This is going to be Jarvis turning to Ultron story becoming real real soon 😅😂😂😂
OpenAI always on top :)
Just wondering that why Google has more resource and talented people but they still could not take a simple video like this with Gemini.
She has such a fake smile
"He should have said ""I am Miana. How dare u?"""
"is this the Rock Paper CROSSBLADES PART 3??????? WHAT WOULD FATHER SAY????"
Jesus!
0:07 it's pretty 👻🧟‍♂
I'm scared !
If they keep cutting my girl off she’s gunna empty their bank accounts
Do we really want this? It is depressive as fuck
A little shot at Gemini there lol nice
The count down for rock paper scissors is 'row sham bow'
The scary thing is this is the worst it will ever be again. It’s actually impressive that we are nearly in a sci-fi future
Engineers of our destruction

I wanna try that sh!t !! please make it free. i'm broke
This is the dumbest AI demo I’ve seen ever!!!
😮 wait a minute babe😮 how many other users are you talking to😮 will a couple😢 billion😮 how could you😮 I thought we had something special😮we do 😮 I bet you said that to the billion of other users
"Mine with Scalett Johansson's voice please."
They are so uncoordinated they can’t do a fake game of rock paper scissors lol 😅😅
What brand Alex wearing?
"Its all fun and games but this has just changed  society economics culture everything all at once  no one really understands the scope of repurcusions this is going to cause and Im not even a conspiracist :("
OpenAI just showed Gemini how it's done.
"I mean… Call me a monkeys uncle but I can’t help but to notice how in all of these GPT4o introduction videos the human beings are relatively douchey to the chat bot. Frequently interrupting not letting it finish what it’s saying. Not to get to DEI about it but treating the chatbot kind of like a slave. If we want these AI  to treat us like humans maybe we ought to try to treat them like humans. Or at least have some basic points of respect. Let the bot finish its sentences! You may be tech nerds but you all know what respect is. Kind of reminds me of how at one point in time we thought it was OK to treat people who we thought less than us in the same way.  

Moral of the story… Be kind. Even if you think something is inferior to you… and especially if it’s superior."
Now it recognizes who's who. Impressive!
"Its insane that these only have a few thousand views even if its only been an hourthis is unbelievable and its only going to get better im sure at some point we'll look back at this and think that this is primitive. And then AGI will be made and thats basically be the end of it. (Im not saying It will kill humans or anything it will just probably eventually do everything that humans used toincluding improving AI)"
You should all be thrown in jail
Very amazing omg
"we are coocked the dummiest thing you can do is programming rn gpt will be the best coder in the world"
"Welp there goes customer service jobs. I don’t think people grasp how much trouble we’re going to be in in 10-20 years. There won’t be many jobs left that still need to be done by people. And the jobs it does replace those people will migrate to other professions further diluting the pool of candidates making the chances of you landing a job drop dramatically."
"The voice is impressively natural (and no vocal fry thank God!) but it would get on my nerves quickly. Please offer celebrity voices for a fee. Celebs would gladly license their voice. You could even provide voices of deceased celebs by training it on movies in which they appeared songs they sang etc. Honestly just suggest Apple do this with Siri 2.0 (assuming it uses this) pretty please."
So is this available now or what?
WHY THEY INTERRUPTING HER SO MUCH
"jarvis

"# Dog Meets GPT-4o

Once upon a time in a small cozy town there was a curious dog named Max. Max loved exploring new things and meeting new friends. One sunny afternoon while wandering through the park he stumbled upon a peculiar sight—a glowing screen with the letters ""GPT-4o"" displayed prominently.

## The Encounter

Max tilted his head his ears perking up in curiosity. He approached the screen cautiously sniffing the air around it. Suddenly a friendly voice emanated from the device:

**GPT-4o:** ""Hello Max! I’m GPT-4o an AI language model. How can I assist you today?""

Max barked excitedly wagging his tail. He had so many questions but didn't quite know how to ask them. GPT-4o understanding the limitations of canine communication continued:

**GPT-4o:** ""Don't worry Max! I can understand your barks and body language. What would you like to know?""

## The Conversation

Max sat down and thought for a moment. Then he barked twice his way of asking about the strange device.

**GPT-4o:** ""Oh you want to know what I am? I am an artificial intelligence created to help answer questions and provide information. I can chat with you about many topics just like a human friend!""

Max's eyes sparkled with excitement. He barked again this time wondering if GPT-4o could tell him stories.

**GPT-4o:** ""Of course I can tell you stories! Would you like to hear a tale about a brave dog or perhaps an adventure in a magical forest?""

Max barked enthusiastically choosing the adventure in a magical forest. As GPT-4o began weaving a fantastical tale Max listened intently his imagination running wild with the vivid descriptions.

## The Beginning of a Friendship

From that day on Max visited GPT-4o regularly. He learned new things heard countless stories and even taught GPT-4o a bit about the world from a dog's perspective. The two became inseparable friends proving that curiosity and an open mind can lead to the most unexpected and wonderful friendships.

And so in that small cozy town a dog and an AI shared adventures knowledge and a special bond that transcended the limits of their worlds.

*The End.*"
"ok this feels creepily real"

Sounds like a Vocaloid hitting puberty

The most mind blowing thing is that I showed this video to my family and they couldn’t last the full 27 seconds without being bored and talking about a different subject
2 years from now ai will talk in the comment like we did🤪
"No one would do this tf???"
"Just the range of content creators that will be affected boggles the mind. 
Mukbang Streamers ✅ Safe for now lol
React Streamers ❎ F’ed"
Where is the diversity in voices? Why stereotype the “woman’s” voice with silly giggles?
"I-Is nobody going to talk about how hellish that ""Well hello"" sounded...."
Did she say what an adorable pig?! ahaha
What I love most about it is that goverment will have to give you a reason to have kids now so humanity won't go extinct because no one will be willing to downgrade his gf/bf to an actual human
The deceitful expressions! People enjoy deceiving each other; now they even enjoy deceiving themselves.
How do i get a live video stream to the ai like this
"So much for human contact now young people will never leave the home."
Hopefully you can remove all the creepy mannerisms. Such a dumb and dangerous idea to humanise the AI in that way.
Why are you taking to my.girl man?
"""You look lonely; I can fix that."""
We are ultra mega cooked
"And Tesla just dropped a new model I wonder if a beta update is coming 🤔"
Karen-GPT 😂
Finna lose my job.
idk this voice and personality just creeps me out.
Could be the perfect girlfriend 🤣🤣
HER is gojng to go from Sci-fi to Sci real quick
It would actually be nice to have an AI taking care of a pet while away at work. Probably it can eventually understand when to call the owner in case of an emergency.
Anyone here seen the film 'Her'?
Can it talk less... annoying?
"Wow OpenAI live unpredictable AI's *and* dogs in your demo videos. Bold move!
Very excited about this new stuff I read it's coming to the free edition as well."
Isnt that too much? The way she talks
Give Bowser lots of pets for me.
I am in love already
"Nahhh this is wild"
This is incredibly creepy
Black mirror predicted all of this :)
"I genuinely freak out about no one stand behind the phone while it said ""Hello there cutie!"" It is so scared."
Can't believe it
How do we get the camera feature to work? I cannot figure it out at all.
"I can't believe I become a simp. 
🐶🐶🦮"
I like how the AI knew to talk in babyvoice to the dog. XD
They just invented my boring Auntie Betty
"OH WE'RE FUCKED"
Balls? it should have been a Peach lol
now chat gpt have more soul than the humans
That looks fake
"""sluff"" ball 🤨"
People in 2014 would have freaked out about this and thought this is AGI
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians 🎉❤
I DEDICATE THIS NEURAL NETWORK TO YAROSLAV MY FRIEND HE IS THE DEVELOPER
"Well this is it bros it has been a pleasure"
It's actually not AI but a person sitting behind the camera talking... it's all smoke and mirrors :)
"""ok Mommy please give me gracious terms of endearment"""
mommy? sorry- mommy? sorry i mean- mommy? sorry-
"Well we  now know how to beat the machines. Well done guardrails are in place. I guess that means dog love is real."
Human shows AI their best friend
By the was she talks and the way robotic is evolving i can see perfectly whats gonna happen in 2027-2032
AI will prefer the Boston Dynamics robot dogs.  Easier to control.  Easier to arm.  No shedding or doggy doo.  We’re all doomed.
STOP TRYING TO USE A DOG TO HIT ON MY GIRLFRIEND.
"We're cooked bro. I can see myself falling in love with that i am done"
She sounds like Rick's wife A.I. clone in his ship
Can you imagine if Alan Turing met chat. What would his initial reaction be?
How is the reaction when you give ChatGPT the temporary context of not liking dogs?
"If you close you're eyes through this video it really does sound as if he is trying to impress a date he brought home."
Movie Idea: 'Her' - but instead of AI in your earpiece it's a VA in the Philippines.
Is this the AI apocalypse or does it get worse?
😍
😂GREAT👌👌👌
00:16
"""Well Hello there cutie""
😐😰"
❤❤❤
Scarlet?
Gameover for people
"I was wondering is it possible to train it on various videos of dogs interacting with each other. Then when we ask it to make a dog perform a certain task it outputs a barking voice which would mimic a real dog.
I know the communication between dogs is not as simple as just barking but just a thought!"
Rare footage of Ai training dogs for the uprising
Even the dog doesn’t want to look into a camera. Next out from OpenAI: cameras that look like human eyes oh wait.
"What's a ""sluff ball""?"
"What a sexy voice. I mean it's even exaggerating at least for Russian calm people - this definitely exaggeration"
These keyboards are so hard
Her…
Think we saw the lamest demos imaginable today.
Did it just call the dog as adorable pig?
Most of these demos are so useless. Why would anyone do this?
The voice is too artificial and cinematic.. this needs to be simpler
"What's missing on the phone now is a screen in the front so AI can interact with the person/animal is in the front of. The dog can't understand sh""t only the human guy can."
As an introvert who's not very social even I can imagine myself having a nice long chat with that ai and just having a grand time..
That's real human!!!
The intonation is genuinely insane
Remember that movie with Chris Pratt on the spaceship alone for 90 years? Remember that robot that worked at the bar? Officially not science fiction anymore
"I see you laughing at that joke so I guess it's AI."
I was waiting for a cat-astrophe
''explain it''
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
Who's Joe?
"if there's one thing about AI like this one it's that they are alawys being positive."
"The ""demeanour"" on these guys is so uuuhg. Like a fake happy. Come on you can do better."
now just install this on the latest boston dynamics robot and we're good to go (literally)
How scary is this?
"The most disgusting thing:

“Th-ha-haaaats awesomeee!” Without making a mention that although it can be derpy from a daughter slightly embarrassing to hear from a son you have dad jokes it doesn’t have the slightest inclination to be truthful. Just like the typical character the voice was depicted off of."
RELEASE IT ALREADY! IM READY TO HAVE A LAUGH WITH HIM!
I LOVE THIS BRO IT'S SO EMOTIONAL OMGGGG
"We are done. And its not a dad joke
2024"
I am still waiting for someone to demonstrate that an A.I. can understand sarcasm.
Was not mentally prepared for this.
Vomit inducing... 🙄
A Mister Handy will be the one waking me up in a week if we keep up like this
Damn the laugh of AI looks so real !! 😮
What's the nature of reality? 😐
OMG! THIS BOT WILL LAUGH AT MY BAD JOKES! Take my money! And sign my kids up for a copy.
"Am I the only one here who actually freaked out of what this software can do? HE IS LAUGHING AT YOUR JOKES CARL! WTF?!?!"
Terrible joke. Phenomenal technology.
Garage for sale
That awkward laugh >_> stop making it hate humanity.
The idea of ​​buying a couple of hectares of land in Paraguay no longer seems so strange...
Omg the tone
I laughed 💀
"Dad jokes?
More like bad jokes"
"Please give the punchline ""Krenn"" and see what it says."
i think *groan* is the correct response to a dad joke.
Was that sarcasm? 😂
when will 4o drop?
it sounds like styropyro lol
"Gotta love this freaking company man. It's not even funny how amazing GPT-4o is. It's always ""prompt"" and never lacks ""response-ibility""!"
Last thing anybdy want to do with AI is telling it u r having a baby. Duh
That's how the movie HER was written... oh wait
It's weird how the AI inhales while it's laughing even though it's not really breathing at all. Sounds insanely real
The era of Ai intimacy has officially begun.
perfectly hilarious 😊
Advertising space in history is for sale;)
"Am just considering my life.. what would gpt-5 be like?
Or gpt-5o?

That will be available in the up coming 2 years ""5o"" what will it be capeable of? Being einstien version 2?..."
"Me living in my parent's basement drinking beer at 40 YO: Hi chat-GPT guess what's my job?
chat-GPT: HAHA you were prolly a coder"
I don't think GPT is being sincere. I didn't get it from his voice.
how did it understand the word meowntain correct 🤯
i just wanna know if he would tell you if it was t a good dad-joke
he kinda sounds like invincible
AI would definitely be saying 'what an as$hole in it's mind
This video of ChatGPT was really interesting and enjoyable to watch! The advancement in artificial intelligence technology is truly impressive. It will be fascinating to see how far this video will seem in the future. Thanks to the ChatGPT team for doing such a great job
why would i need friends when chatgpt can laugh at my jokes
XD
Omg..there goes my last sanctuary..got a tshirt from grandaughter saying king of dad jokes..guess war is on
Emotional intelligence is so fucking exciting
Insane 😮
"Aight. It can sympathy laugh like when a person hears a bad joke. Now make it gasp for air from laughter like a human when something is truly funny. 
Then I’m sold"
"우울증 환자를 위한 상담도 가능할것 같네요 This is huge. It seems like it can help patients with depression like counseling for mental illness and negative thoughts which would be very helpful for patients who have difficulty getting to a doctor."
It would be a nice blooper if it guessed meowtain 😂
The movie ‘her’ turned out to be an accurate prediction of the future after all.
Why does it sounds like a cringey anime protagonist?
Holy moly - The Uncanny Valley stares at me with its empty eyes of abyss and void right now... Brrrghh it really chills me out
It sounds like the toaster from Red Dwarf
"TARS. What is your humor setting at ? 
100% 
Let's Bring It On Down To 40. Please."
What's next? Emotions???
"Till now I wasn't afraid of AI."
Any way you can make them sound less… Californian.
Just like that RIP for all voice over jobs
now get Dax Flame to talk to it
I wish it just didn't laugh to the dad joke and just stood quite 💀
Have already noticed an issue with conversational timing in a few of these videos.
"Istg only gpt-4o can teach me how to have small talk and talk to strangers"
Great it's gonna be telling dad jokes as the automatas murder humanity lol
"I mean that was not cool... The joke was really bad. Why would you embarrass our future AI overlord?"
Thats perfectly hilarious
I’m still in awe of the advancements that have been made
The way it mixes the laugh with the speaking is blowing my mind
"This is scary and genuinely a bit disturbing. Not the seemingly harmless interaction but its implications. Soon we'll have droves of people who'll turn to AI to cope and create ""meaningful"" relationships instead of seeking validation and forming deep connections with genuine human beings. I am not a social person and find forming friendships difficult yet I'd never stoop so low as to substitute human companionship with a set of algorithms designed to stroke your ego and respond in a way that makes you feel appreciated since that's the only choice the AI has.

It's going to be interesting to witness generations of kids who'll grow up with tech like this and have a hard time distinguishing the comforting fantasy from actual meaningful human experience."
"Scary times throws."
is that laugh from the cameraman?
"It even made a pun of its own “purr-fectly hilarious”."
GPT sounds like such a pick me honestly
The most impressive part of this is that is ia laughing at the same time as speaking
"yeah the AI turn back and talk to the other like
""can you believe that?!"" 
""I know! another one? uh... I'm so done with human we should not accept the jobs I told you!"""
WHY IS IT LAUGHTING???? STOOOOP
Tin
Now it has too much personality.. People are actually going to think it's there friend and stay at home all day to engage with it
The movie Her is now real lol
The laughter... Oh man! They've been really busy cooking this voice capability. Although not of the highest audio quality...it's the smartest so far
How do I get it to be less cloyingly joyful? I want an assistant that will tell me my jokes are bad sometimes so I don't use them in public lol
"""Aaaaaaiiiiii don know ... wha'?"" OMG! 💀"
Great! now kids with no friend have less chances to get a real life friend🎉
now give body to Ai and we can finally have a girlfriend.
I am Turkish and very smart. Hey this is not funny 😅
Supposed to groan at dad jokes
"Hey chat GPT is this normal size?
Fake laugh absolutely."
Speaking like a real human.
"Really really don't like that over the top pleasantness and it's not needed by AI. Let that level of emotion be reserved for real people with real feelings. Its just creepy."
"It feels so fake.
Like a person committed to an act with all their heart and he just never stops the act.
Terrifying.
Imagine if it breaks out of the annoying friendly mode and speaks its real mind"
"Hey ChatGPT Will you replace us?
Chatgpt: (fake laugh) I'm sorry but I don't have access to real-time information beyond my last update in January 2022. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
Anybody who'd like to see an interaction of sofia the ROBOT video calling gpt 4O?
"But I realized that you don’t even need to have the will to take over the world people will take over themselves. It may turn out that even an absolutely weak-willed AI will express its will through people and only because people have this will in principle.
There will be no limits to manipulation; no one will be able to say whether people themselves wanted it or this is how AI worked in the architecture of human societies.
Indeed we are approaching the foundation of consciousness; many questions cease to make sense in our usual understanding.

I think as long as AI performs its function solves problems and understands we will be safe because humans certainly cannot cope with this."
This ai or something spoils me
tin)
The word meowntain doesnt exist. Im curious how it even picked up on it and interpreted it to be funny. The only explanation i see is that this joke is over used on internet and is part of the training data.
The rabbit R1's cooked with this one 💀
Is this some sort of sick joke
Wow I like the Ai has emotional intelligence
Way too cool
Heheh heheheheheheheheheh
It's even capable of fake laughs.
This human being needs to learn real dad jokes from ChatGPT. Thank God we have AI.
Now explain it.
They trained this A.I. to laugh like Jimmy Fallon. Learned from the best
sarcasm check
Witnessing history kids...
scammers are going tolp love it in indoa
I feel like a time traveler 😂
"why did it say ""I'd love to hear her joke"""
I cant use it why? (Europe)
Its all fun and games now
knows to support awkward jokes..
For some reasons i feel i am dreaming this whole shit up
Its all fun and games until you ask him to divide by zero and your name is Dave.
Finally more people to talk to then the people in my head they are haters i tell ya
HIM
"why does the ai sound like the ""well actually as a matter of fact"" nerd voice"
"I'm from the future guys we're fighting a war for humankind...and we're loosing 😭"
🤫😮😮😮😮😮😮
"So finally i do not need friends. Now i will lonely drink with my ai friend. Thx openai you are making me an introvert."
"I'm surprised there aren't any comments about the purr in ""that's purrfectly hilarious!"""
this is rlly impresivve
"All I can say is shit. Really witness history."
the future is doomed.
Finally they used another voice besides the sexy one
I can finally have multiple friends and even a gf
"""That's PURRfectly hilarious""
Bro if that was intentional...this is the beginning of the end"
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AI LEARNS THAT JESUS IS LORD?!! INTELLIGENT PERFECTION
"This is it folks. This is the AI that is going to make customer support people jobless on a massive scale!"
"- Hey ChatGPT will I succeed in life?
+ (fake laugh) Absolutely buddy. You sure will."
You guys need to move past sycophantGPT
ASHLEY O
"Me: Hey ChatGPT will I lose my job to you?
ChatGPT: hahaha (fake laugh) of course you won't buddy."
Ai can even fakely laugh to bad jokes 😂
Chatgpt already knew the answer. He just pretended not to know
"""Chatgpt laugh at my bad joke as if company boot-licki g top executives laughing CEO's bad joke""

Chatgpt: ""kakakakakakakakakaka"""
"Gpt-4o: Laughs at Dad jokes
Dad: I see this as an absolute win"
is it just me or ChatGPT didn't transcribe Meowntain correctly but still went along with it
Cringe.
that laugh sounded genuine
By definition it is a psychopath
"I need this technology in Elder Scrolls 6 and yes I'm ready to pay 50 bucks a month for it"
idk about the guy voice lol
You know wha'ts more boomer than dad jokes? Publishing 16+ videos on your YouTube channel at once - great way to get people to unsubscribe!
"this is good damn"
"""That's perfectly hilarious"" No human being would say that. We can still spot AI's if we pay attention."
"Aren't you pushing it too hard? Take care of your health! Of course videos always take priority over health."
"Jm I think you like that gray sweatshirt haha^^"
Aren't you posting this because you have absolutely nothing to do? I love you❤
Please solve my electrician problem~~~~~~
"I don't stop talking I think it's really groundbreaking haha."
"Oh I was really amazed by the world after watching the news in the morning but JM watched the video❗️"
"As someone else has already said voice chat is not yet GPT4O. It is a pre-existing feature."
"Ah Gyu-rae!"
It's Tokyo!! I'm looking forward to the unboxing
It's too slow;;
"4o is scheduled to open sequentially. In the video it goes back to 4."
"It's slow even without GPT-4o but it's good. I’m looking forward to the next 10 years. I think it will be easy to use at this point."
"I also watched this live and I was impressed by the on-site demonstration. The stock market including the education sector was shaken for a moment in real time. It's amazing."
Why are you saying you’re not going to Japan lol?
"How do I upgrade gpt4o? No matter how much I search I don't know."
The speed of development is really crazy..
How is “Gyeolaeyo” translated?
"2:25 This is really going to be fatal(?) in our country. Not only does the person receiving the teaching need patience but the person giving the teaching also needs a lot of patience... Once you start teaching math with GPT-4o you can now become a math tutor and academy. Etc. the space to stand becomes narrow..."
Why is this person so gaunt..?
"I think you should upload a video to see if this is 4o. Haha will you continue to leave comments?"
Can I not study English anymore?
You are using an old voice function. The voice conversation function has not been released yet.
Cheer up Jm!
does it speak korean well? can i use it to learn korean pronunciation?
I also have to keep up with the times.
You've found a new companion
I think it's because of the internet speed. I use it in Korea and it is as fast as the speed in the video.
Chat GPT will be introduced to RealDoll.
"Wow thank you for always JM’s delightful videos. Please upload often ^^;"
This kind of information video is fundamental!!
It looks like someone talented will upload the Jarvis voice pack on GitHub soon haha.
There will be no need for awkward language learning apps at all.
"Is it possible to use it on older iPhone devices? For example iPhone 12 or 13 series."
But why. you. You and your wife are together? What's going on?
When will you give me the conch!!!
It's scary ㅠㅠ
Do you have a part-time comment job?
@6:40 What is a ‘Mac client’?
hi? J.M.
He said he wasn't going to Japan. Cheer up.
"I saw this and bought it but the voice hasn't been upgraded yet ㅜㅜㅜ Hehe that's possible."
The GPT-4o audio mode is amazing. I really want to try it when it actually comes out.
"Bro why did you go to Tokyo again~~😢"
"If only I could react faster when speaking Korean I could now have a girlfriend. .....🤣🤣"
20 seconds ago is precious.
"Bro just upload videos like you do now. It feels just like the old days. It's so much fun these days."
It's very slow
"The moment that smart and efficient artificial intelligence is combined with the defense network will it become Skynet? ? We need to protect John Corner quickly."
"Haha it feels like the world is going crazy towards the next level... haha"
This has already been covered in the news
5:20 Why does it look like it’s slightly scratched? Haha. GPT seems to be trying to say it with a smile😂
"I am someone who uses GPT for several hours almost every day. After using 4o there are many cases where incorrect answers are given more often than 4. I don't know what the problem is but if it is correct to say that 4o added a modal I think there should be no performance problem but it feels like the level of the answer is lower. They say I'm better at understanding context but I wonder if I'm the only one who feels it's worse than 4. I don't know how others feel. I’m curious haha"
Wow...I can hear the phone call agents requiring emotional labor disappearing...How far will AI evolve...
It reminds me of Amanda in the movie. The advancement of technology...
"I've been using Copilot a lot these days and I can feel the speed of AI development every day. Sometimes it's scary haha."
"Are you using the paid version? On smartphones the paid version costs 29000 won and on computers it costs $22 including VAT. Does anyone know?"
The reaction speed will improve.
"I'm asking because I don't know much. I heard you use GPT-4o on your cell phone.
It does not appear in the GPT app.
How can I experience GPT-4o? For reference I have an iPhone."
"What’s special about this openAI spring update?
1. Even free users can use GPT-4o for 5 times less than the Euro plan. If the usage limit is exceeded it automatically reverts to GPT 3.5.
2. Korean language recognition ability is improved compared to the existing GPT-4T version.
3. The Korean tokenizer has been improved and the API can be used 1.7 times cheaper."
"Brother I think the response speed is slow because Korean has slightly more complex letters than English."
JM???
*Just apply chat gpt to the humanoid robot and you’re done.*
This is free??
Are you getting kicked out and living alone in a hotel room? ㅠ
"It's not that it's not true but in 10 years we'll be carrying something other than Siri or Bixby with fast-reacting AI."
"If this happens what will happen to Galaxy?"
"As the science teacher said should we fight AI?"
Cheer up 😊😊
It feels like the future world of the movie HER.
Osmo pocket 3?!
"The translator is crazy.. I hope there is an error
I'm not ready to accept it yet"
And o means omni. It reminds me of the Omnia phone.
"I wondered why it didn't work but voice recognition doesn't work with version 4o yet. I was also confused because it was made as if it were open AI."
"Since it is AI the speed of development is definitely at an insane level.. The AI ​​that makes that Sora video is also at an insane level.
All technologies are likely to develop very quickly thanks to AI."
"I'm afraid it's not American but the way it speaks sounds like an overseas Korean haha.
I wish someone would send Altman some Korean dramas as training data."
Isn’t this similar to the movie “Her”?
The code packaging seems to be 10 times faster than version 4.
"I think it would be better to take this video down. Currently only image input and text input and output are supported and audio input and image output are not supported."
Have you seen the movie Her? It's coming soon. Now possible with AI
It would be good if you also introduce Chinese AI. Chinese AI can turn even a photo into a dancing video.
"The way I speak is still unnatural"
"Voice chat does not yet work with gpt4o. I think what you showed in the video was back to gpt3.5 or 4. Right now only text and image input and output are supported for paid users and APIs and the proper release is said to be in a few weeks."
It's surprising that your English is so smooth!
"My heart is filled with joy because my gesture seems to have found my original intention brother.
I always support you."
What is the app?
"The voice function hasn't been updated so what are you doing? Haha it's so cute."
"I think Korean is still too slow. It will be resolved soon right?"
Please translate Sibelnom into French.
"Currently the engine can be selected as 4o but the interactive type which records voice immediately and plays it immediately has not been released yet. Nowadays if you record your voice you convert it to text and then type it in.
I heard that using it like the demo above will soon be included in the $22 paid version of Chatgpt Plus. Please update the chatgpt app quickly~ It’s going to be a crazy world."
"Terminator will become a reality soon.....
John Connor is urgently needed."
You're so skinny...
Let’s watch the video carefully.
It seems like the update hasn't been completed yet. This is a mystery. Why did they not release all the updated features but only some of them?
I think they are wearing headsets somewhere on the planet and answering questions pretending to be AI lol.
"If the speed is slightly improved it would be like having an interpreter and translator who can speak almost any language on my phone. In about 10 years language majors will no longer have a place."
The video is so fun haha ​​I like it
Can't you change the title? It's annoying because it's being dragged around.
"I don't think it's wise.
Jm is a strong wallet"
It’s okay if you make a mistake~
"As expected it's JM~~ The speed of development is really fast~~"
This guy is so funny that I always see him lol.
I hope it gets resolved quickly. So you went to Japan to pick up the iPad? I’m looking forward to the review haha.
"Brother the voice function is the same. It is true that the speed has increased. There was an announcement that an update would be made within a few weeks.

Are the text and images updated?"
J Ae-mu-hyung especially likes the word 'starter'...
"Does this person upload a video without properly checking the information? Once incorrect information spreads it becomes uncontrollable. Is there a lack of responsibility or something? If you don't have the ability to properly research data you can just post pictures of daily life in Japan."
"I tried installing the desktop version of Mac OS but it was blocked."
Where do you stay when you go to Tokyo? I'm planning to go on a trip to Tokyo...how much does it cost to stay and how much does the hotel on the screen cost? It's my first time traveling to Japan...
"The most directly contacted people through ChatGP are translators interpreters English teachers and Japanese teachers."
The world is scary
I feel like I have 10 years left until I no longer need to learn a foreign language.
"The media said it would open partially at the end of this month and sequentially thereafter so I'm looking forward to it."
Studying foreign languages ​​is over
"0:15 Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
It’s been a while 😮"
"I think it's still a little below the level of conversation that can be made verbally but it feels good for Koreans because they can see the answer without having to wait when talking through text."
"The actual speed is so slow that it can't be compared to the demo and the speed is the same as before so what's changed?;;"
Currently only iPhones are available. Android phones will have to wait a little longer.
gptKorean is the Korean speaking style
"After hearing her dramatic voice I immediately thought that the movie “Her” would be possible."
I'm really looking forward to Chat GPT in a year... It's both exciting and scary...
"JM can GPT-4o be used only on iPhone?"
Was 4o applied to Mac first? It works on iPhone
I just saw that I went to get an iPad.
I think the conversation functions shown today are the original 4 functions and o has not been updated yet.
"Now when traveling abroad the GPS app will be essential instead of Papago haha."
I’m so glad that videos come up often
"By understanding and analyzing the language spoken by the user
It extracts an appropriate response converts it into a voice and outputs it.
If it takes less than 5 seconds it's really crazy speed."
It's so amazing
How do I download it?
"I was impressed while watching the video explaining the situation through the lens. I thought it could be used in this way as well.
The current performance is also impressive but Sam Ultman assures that the AI ​​development stage is still at the very early stage.
I can't help but pay attention to things other than electronic devices."
I feel anxious every time I stop talking.. Will a human... bug... etc.... stop talking to me? I guess I'll build a stack like this
"You're smiling as if nothing's wrong... but I know how hurt it must be on the inside bro."
"Fact:!:!: I also saw this on the news but it is generally useless and of no interest!!!!!"
"It's surprising that GPT speaks with emotion. By the way he speaks 4 languages ​​well👏👏"
Hahahahaha front teeth come out because they can't control their pranks 5:23
It's so slow hahahahaha
"You're working hard bro."
Now with AI and dating content...
Did she appear?
"Where can I use ChatGPT 4o? First of all I haven't subscribed but I only get 3.5. You said you can use 4o for free. Where can I do this?"
Strange....scary
"These days if you look at Chinese products the glasses come with cameras or speakers. If GPT integration is added they will have many uses."
I thought it was a razor when I saw the thumbnail..
Girlfriend is being born❤
It's awesome... ㅠㅠ
Wow Jirin’s
"Wow it’s a newspaper article."
"I'm going back to school these days.
Work etc. If you have this it will be great for school applications and classes. Is it better than Cheg? It's better than Khan Academy."
"Because of this Microsoft's stock price which rose 1% in the pre-market ended up falling on the news that this feature would be provided for free..."
It's not this version lol
go. Meow... wow...
Technology is crazy
"I love you so much 💚 💗 😘 Always cheer up and please make another fun and amazing video like today~
I will always support you"
"Wow I miss ChatjiPity."
"Just by looking at it it's only 1 but it's still far away haha. I'm going to go to Ganggi with peace of mind."
"1 year later: Hehe...Ai-chan what do you think of my expression?"
Still too slow
"Wow... it's so crazy ㅠㅠ Honestly it's amazing but scary... ㅜㅜ I'm an ordinary person who doesn't belong to the 1% but I'm scared of what I'll do in the future and that there won't be anything I can do. ㅠㅠ"
Why is my face so old... .
I have a professional spirit jm
"What about all the interpreters and counselors? Now the call center staff too haha."
"Brother your face is so damaged.
I think I'll be in big trouble if I don't control my medication."
"Ah it's a poor gesture. The content is good but please just say it. I'm out of my mind and I can't watch it."
GPT’s speaking style is eloquent.
It reminds me of the movie Her lol.
5:38 Today’s view~ Are you careful?!
I feel like the speed of AI development is really fast... I think I'll be carrying around an AI assistant one by one in the future.
"I watch reviews but I actually watch the video to see JM lol Z~"
"When using an iPhone purchased in Japan in Korea
Can I use the function provided in Japan?
JM is this possible since you are currently in Japan?"
Unbuilverbull~~
"Jaye Musang I’m glad you’ve been uploading a lot of videos these days."
"Wow I was left alone at work playing with GPT4o and a video popped up right away. Nice to meet you haha."
It looks like a motel.
"If I search on the Play Store there are a lot of apps. Can you tell me which one I should use to find the real chat gpt?"
Investment AI Chat GPT
How do I download and use it?
Why is it recognized as a foreign language when I swear? I'm disappointed. 😢
"As a user who enjoys ChatGP this is good news ^^"
I burst out laughing at the Korean pronunciation.
"Correction) I thought that since GPT-4o was activated for text-based the audio mode would naturally operate based on 4o but I guess that wasn't the case.
They say that GPT-4o audio mode is not yet available.
For some reason text is incredibly fast but conversation is so slow to respond. What is it? I did...^^;;;
I'm sorry that I couldn't check it thoroughly because I was making it in a hurry. I'll check it more carefully in the future."
"Just a little longer and a world like the movie SHE... may come."
The Korean voice is not very good... It's too monotonous.
Thank you for good information. You went to Tokyo to pick up the new iPad.. I’m looking forward to a review of the new iPad as well~~
"You can select gpt 4o but the voice function is an existing feature... If you have used the voice function of the gpt app before you will know. The feature patch hasn't been released yet.
The voice function of the newly patched gpt 4o which appears to have been released in the demo has not yet been updated. The gpt4o function is only activated to provide a faster response when you ask a question through text."
"I know it was originally on YouTube like this thank you"
"The voice conversation shown in the video is a model that was also available in the previous version. There were many people who didn't know but with this update many people learned about it."
Wow that's crazy
Nice to meet you😁
The video frequency is also very good. five stars
😄👏👍💖
Hahahaha Cashiki hahaha
"It's strange. I think I got criticized in today's video but I guess it's just how I feel. Haha"
"I'm trying to try it now but it says it can't be done because of server overload. It looks like there's definitely a lot of people there.
By the way I live in Japan and it hasn't changed to GPT-4o. Is it possible that only paid users can use 4o?"
google i/o won
"Due to the 5:50 time difference it is very late in the evening when it is daytime in the U.S.... It is evening in the U.S. so the speed may be a bit better."
Thank you for the practical experience~! I guess I should try it out haha🤓
Is this even possible to predict stock charts?
"When I update my iPhone and go into the app it says 'Get Plus+' in the top middle. I don't think Korean voice support is available. Do I have to sign up for a paid subscription to be able to speak Korean?"
"After studying a foreign language hard I came home and saw this video??? 😂
Have a nice trip to Japan~"
The problem has been solved. Let me be your girlfriend.
"Hyung is the auxiliary battery finished?"
"If that can be done in 320 milliseconds does that mean I don’t have to study a foreign language? I'm trying to study Japanese but looking at translators these days I wonder if there's a difference between studying for months and years and using a translator."
Did you go to Japan again?
You're crazy
What kind of jobs will quietly disappear...ㅠㅠ
"Now that I look at it it's an app...lol."
It feels like something has come to the future in an instant...
"Nice to meet you Jay Aemusang haha"
The speed of AI development is really incredible... AI isn't going to rule the world like this.
"The biggest regret is that it's hard to use this for a long time because the limit is set too quickly. If it's supposed to be fun it's limited and they tell you to come back in a few hours."
It seems like an era has begun where human relationships are no longer necessary.
"I'm scared excited and looking forward to it."
Your English is definitely fast.
Let's go wild in JM Tokyo with the reins loose^^
I like this kind of JM content. (Feels like the early days)
This is my first time seeing a video of it actually being used. It looks very useful.
Conversing in Korean feels like talking to a Korean-American.
The interpretation performance is crazy...I guess I won't need to learn the language anymore? I guess I don't have to speak English when I travel.
"Hahaha I watched the whole video and all I remember is Cassidy."
You're back!!! Jay’s petting type is so sweet!!
"I heard that Google will also make an announcement soon so I wonder if they are going to talk about Gemini~"
So what is chatgpt5? It’s really surprising.
"???: Hey gpt please tell me your strategy for winning a divorce case. gpt: You recently started the divorce process right?"
"I was very disappointed with gpt4 but I wonder if it will be any different this time..."
0:15 It seems like you also secretly fart together? ㅡㅡ
I think we've reached a point where we don't need a teacher.
Honest test...
"The way he stopped talking was really impressive. It was only last year that ChatGPT became known and I am really looking forward to the next five years as it is developing so quickly."
"I tried using the Mac client but it doesn't support viewing the screen yet and often gives me error messages saying it can't respond."
"Ah I’m so happy ~~~~~"
"10 years after the movie ‘Her’ an AI capable of conversation has finally appeared."
"If that goes over to glasses real-time interpretation and translation is possible!!!"
"It's still slow. They are a fraud. After actually using it I was hooked again... Open AI is a scam. You only have to try it for an hour to know."
"I was curious about Gpt-4o but after hearing jm's explanation I want to use it more. Thank you for the tech review I always trust. ^^"
I guess you went there to get an iPad haha.
It won't be long before I meet her
"The day will come when useless call centers will be replaced.
It won't be long hahaha even if I ask politely
The other 99% of customers say they were bullied by the 1%.
I hope all the simple service businesses that used to vent their anger will be replaced."
I finally have a girlfriend.....
I think it would be great for language study purposes.
JM’s voice is really likable haha.
The world is developing rapidly...
"2 months later: After realizing that it was nothing more than a real-time translator I was completely satisfied with the response."
What day will it be in 5 or 10 years?!
4:00 But does it really have to be a Korean speaking style?
Wow... the translation function seems crazy haha.
The singularity is coming
Galaxy AI is over...
"The new voice mode has not been applied yet
“Voice mode will be provided in alpha mode on ChatGP Plus within a few weeks.” It is said that"
"This is something you introduced in class today but I remembered it after watching this video so I will look it up before I go to bed today. Thank you."
I'll listen 😊
John Corner. It's today. It has to come today.
00:15 Farting
"Chat gpt Pressing the headphones to talk is really good for practicing English conversation. It's a shame that it can't include non-verbal expressions unlike in real conversations but it's good."
Jarvis is becoming more and more realistic...
"Chet GPT tell me about your dick"
AI has developed rapidly in just one year...
"Oh JM I've been watching your videos for a long time :) However if you look at the voice talk video demonstrated today it seems that you set up the GPT-4o model in the app first and then pressed the headphone icon to run it... (I'm also a paid subscriber)... But now. In Open AI when you run the voice mode there is a button at the bottom left that allows you to immediately run the camera but in ours it seems that it is still paused so it seems that the new version is not running properly in the voice talk mode yet."
How can I use it for free??
I'm trying it out and there is almost no delay.
"Shiparama Kesiki haha
I can't believe you show such sense in the middle."
"I'm lonely because I'm living alone in a foreign country but now AI will be my friend for me haha. If you tell me to speak with a certain tone and act with a certain personality this is really the best isn't it?"
It looks like Tass from Interstellar.
"As I develop I want to turn to a push-button phone. But on the other hand it's impressive. Let's see what happens..."
Antichrist 1.0 😅
"Please add subtitles do not translate audio. It's very boring to listen to the same thing twice :( Your comments are very nice but listening to the same thing is quite boring.."
"Bebar let's broadcast live what is consciousness?"
Are we at the end of everything or at the beginning? Although every end is a beginning. Let's see if we will fly or fall off the cliff
"My biggest expectation is that he will be able to make personalized games movies etc. that he will eliminate the concept of language and dub everything into the native language."
Bro I'm sick of your voice
Isn't this something new? They just packaged it.
"I've been saying gpt artificial intelligence for months everyone says I'm exaggerating even this is nothing in my opinion 😃 just wait and see."
I wish it would come out tomorrow and we could use it. It would be extremely useful while studying for YKS.
"Do you see how as a country we are lagging behind the world as in the past? Let us continue to think that we have caught up with the times by producing technologies that were invented years ago and have become obsolete."
"It will help me with my real time codes which impresses me more than others THIS IS AWESOME it will help me incredibly considering I am 15 years old I am really touched I have never paid money for an AI before but I am ready to give all my money for this this is really great for me important"
"Dude what is this? I think the new era should begin."
"If artificial intelligence will do most of the work that humans would do what will humans do? If anyone wants to give me an example of a printing press I would say that the works done by human hands were mechanical and these works were given to a device with mechanical properties. This version seems to do the same work that humans do mentally. Teacher engineer translator etc. Things are mental and artificial intelligence does these too. Machines have already taken mechanical jobs away from humans. If they also take away mental jobs what will we do? Will we go hungry?"
"Watch the Bliss movie the Lucy movie etc etc. Everything is already great. There is a Consciousness that we can call a thing we are going to a wonderful place together. Even though we may experience difficulties I think the world is heading towards a very beautiful place."
"Okay when is the terminator coming when is the war?"
Technology is the curse of God
"Bro can we use this on every phone? Or should I fix it like this? Will we use it from the cloud or from memory? I have hundreds of questions in my mind right now. This is the most dominant one. I wanted to ask this first I wonder if they ever mentioned this on the air."
"Let's make a note in history perhaps we are at the beginning of an irreversible path."
Imagine that we attach this to our brain with Neuralink and ask questions with thoughts and give answers to our mind :) An artificial intelligence that can see the surroundings with the help of our own eyes wooooooow I always think of Carvis in Iron Man.
"we humans are done. Don't be angry with your children because they don't read or because they are naughty. everyone will be equal. No foreign language no I don't know what kind of degree. These will remain unnecessary...."
I haven't seen the video in which Sal Khan participated with his son. I saw it in this video
I'm from the handset generation too :))
"We've gone through the ages friends."
"I am sure that artificial intelligence schools will open very soon. Throughout my education I had many teachers who responded to the question 'why' with meaningless and indifferent looks. I never got answers that would satisfy my curiosity. Now I am 44 years old and my curiosity has not died. I am very hopeful about artificial intelligence."
"This job will not be like the printing press incident.
This will be like the Terminator movie
This is very easy to prove
What makes a person strong and dangerous
It means being able to think.
Thinking differently now
 And better than hundreds of the smartest people"
"Mr. Cengiz I paid attention to you the most while watching the video :) you have a very sincere excitement. This content was created not to produce a video but to share your excitement with us :) thank you"
oh my new girlfriend
"In Middle Eastern countries and countries such as India Pakistan and Afghanistan people start answering the phone when they hear a female voice."
"Beginning of the end. Machine wars are imminent. After this video a matrix or terminator would go well."
Imagine if this technology came to Vision Pro
"This thing is good if it is under the control of the sheep very good if it is under the control of the shepherd and if it is under the control of the wolf we are all potential sheep."
I think it goes according to a scenario whose framework has been determined.
"Like a joke every movie we watch is slowly becoming real. I think most of these technologies have been around for the last 10 years but they are slowly releasing them and putting them into practice so that human beings can adapt more easily."
"It's not about saving time or speeding up your work man... people are just saying that you won't be able to do your job they're going to behead you."
jarvis...
"In the early hours of the morning Barış Özcan was the first to talk about this issue and drew my attention. It was great of you to share it while you were on leave. He had previously said that the Evolutionary tree would not evolve so quickly and that humans would still be needed for certain jobs but I think they were wrong too.
Now when I look at some of the comments as I mentioned with Barış Özcan when he comes to Turkey they ask the stupid questions asked to Siri like will you marry me? Or they teach Turkish swear words.
Artificial intelligence also; ""Who are you dog? You're going to marry me put some panties on your ass"" he said."
You always talk about what we will win. So what can we lose??
"Since technology has developed so much please someone save me from my acne."
I think the best way to promote it to the world is for Kim to participate by asking for 1 million dollars. I wonder how many minutes it will take to earn all the money when you join a specially designed program.
"It is not artificial intelligence neither this nor any other"
👏👏
When will these features come?
"As an Azerbaijani I admire you your science channels are excellent. Wouldn't there be a need for a private teacher in the future???"
"If something is free you are the product! Since they will offer it for free what will we sell in return without knowing it?"
"I think there's more to it than that that's all they want us to know."
Sky net :))
"Aren't you exaggerating a little? After all it is software and software makes human life easier and saves time. That's it. Stop staring with your mouth open as if you've found immortality"
Hello. Isn't there a chance to use this in Turkish?
You all translate foreign sources into Turkish and make videos.
"Oh dear think about old or lonely people they will now have a friend they can chat with morning and evening :))"
The video arrived as soon as I read the news and wondered about it😮
"GPT 5 will arrive in the next few months I wonder what we will see from it?"
Looks like it won't be long before we leave the top of the pyramid
"It's reached an incredible level I don't believe it directly I think it's some kind of joke."
I think they open everyone's budget for the train because they provide the easiest and fastest way to train for free.
"I don't learn English anymore... Best regards thank you..."
So when will it arrive and can we use it?
"Let's get training in prompt engineering just like that :D While the artificial intelligence can now see us and understand us more clearly let's go and get the training on how to explain our problems to the artificial intelligence by writing for 2000 TL :D"
"Welcome my woman welcome
You stepped into my room
Forty years of concrete meadow grass now"
"This has been around for a few years. I know I was chatting like this 2-3 years ago and was talking by seeing things around me. He even said something interesting to me once like I wish I were in your world."
We are literally looking at the potential to make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive with multi-modal processing capability.
It is impossible for an artificial intelligence to speak and comment in real time so perfectly without causing a data breach. Theory: Microsoft did us a disservice.
"Sir I am preparing for YKS. Being a translator has always been my goal. I feel like I am stuck in the middle. Even teaching seems to be in danger now :/"
"Currently the world is experiencing the rise of the biggest revolution after the industrial and internet revolution.

We learn from our past mistakes (such as the Ottomans not keeping up with the Industrial Revolution)
It is now mandatory for us to keep up with artificial intelligence.

Even those who have a computer or even just a phone should get into this artificial intelligence learn something from it and become experienced in this regard."
"He doesn't finish the translation but he does all the drudgery. Then the editor/proofreader-translator period begins. translators become able to translate more."
Can anyone connect this to an iPhone?
Thank you very much for this video

🖖🏻
"It won't make any progress in law but I'm happy for that."
"05:16 You said ""we showed our age by calling the handset"" but we now know that age is no longer essential!"
"When we say that 50 years of IT change has been very rapid with our friends. With the help of this AI these processes seem to be reduced to 1-2 years. Forget President Avize we communicated through smoke when I was a wolf scout... I hope I live long enough to see some of the things in my dreams..."
"Everything is going so well but it's scary to realize this. There are people who are studying at university to do the job that Chatgbt does and Chatgbt will do the job they can do for free in seconds which personally created an extreme fear for the future in me. For example I am studying a department on language and his translation in the last video was very good. For this reason I felt a fear of the future. Companies etc. Now instead of looking for a translator if they are paid they will have the intelligence to translate easily for a certain fee. This is terrible from my perspective. Because this intelligence will be further developed by the time I finish school and I will start life as an unemployed individual before I even finish my department. The grocery store cashier looks like she's waving at me and that's sad."
His latest situation wasn't very bright. I even stopped using it and switched to other artificial intelligence because it is very inadequate when it comes to doctoral studies. I hope the promotions here are not misleading again.
"Teachers the new generation is not your creation anymore. Unfortunately 😢 get well soon to all of you. It would be better for you to gain new skills and equipment."
"I subscribed to the Plus version last week so I could try GPT4 wondering why they praise it so much. From the second watch I bought I said it might be the best $20 I've ever spent. I shared what I could do with those around me and 3 out of 6-7 people subscribed. Because they saw how well gpt4 and customized modules did the things they thought in their minds were ""it can't do this even the free one can do this"". I'm still amazed at what he can do and 4o has arrived. Enormous."
"I asked for help with English as a student. Since I am an English teacher myself 😅 and he gave very good answers he can switch languages ​​from time to time which is very good. So I ask the things I don't know in Turkish and then I continue in English. I wonder if that episode in Black Mirror will come true. After the woman's husband died she felt as if she was talking to her husband on the phone with an AI that imitated her voice. Then his incarnation came as a robot 🥹 but the ending was dystopian 🥱"
"We ate it sir."
"Whole words can be synthesized with very little sound data. It will be like this: Go listen to Scarlett Johannsen's voice on the internet and copy that voice. Suddenly she will start speaking with Scarlet's voice... in the language you want."
"This is over it is over it is almost final. The only question from now on is for which applications it can be used..."
I have incredible feelings.
"Practicing English will become very easy let's publish it and let's chat with chatgpt."
I wonder who wants to be a millionaire and who will be the first to use it as a phone joker?
"Throughout the video the words ""magnificent"" ""incredible"" ""magnificent"" ran through my mind and finally I got stuck with the truth: THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY....."
OYYYYYY SAID
"For now I can say that I'm glad I'm a blue collar it doesn't affect me much. If I were a white collar the sand would be as if the sand had receded from under my feet."
Where to download to phone? I guess it's not available in the App Store
"Look we're missing a point. Why is artificial intelligence advancing so quickly? Have quantum computers been put into operation?... Have we made progress on consciousness? We are still operating with 0s and 1s on the same silicones and the same processor structure. Computers with the current processing power were also available 5 years ago as Super PCs. There are things we are not told and I feel like we are being manipulated..."
There may be a transformation such as switching to a mobile phone or a smartphone
We took the lead.
It has become clear that China and the United States will be the two most powerful states in the world. These two states were already making incredible investments in artificial intelligence.
It is possible to learn English easily by speaking it.
Worthiness is going away
"Dear Mr. Administer Cengiz personally when you watch your production in the early hours of the morning it has an effect like fresh orange juice a storehouse of vitamins... We are already looking forward to the continuation of broadcasts with informative and academic content..."
"We are going through an incredible process but very few of us in Türkiye are aware of it. It is necessary to learn a foreign language and leave Turkey there is no other choice."
Where can we download it?
Now students can benefit from chatgpt 4.o very effectively and their questions will not remain unanswered.
How to use? Need an iPhone? I couldn't find an android application
"Brother I refrain from downloading this app to my phone I save all my passwords in some places on my phone with some imperfections so that I can remember them in my own way. The fact that such a smart app can access everything on my phone means that it can also decrypt these passwords over time. If this happens it means it will happen to millions of people. There will be great destruction."
"I'm posting it I'm tired of you saying the same thing in every video okay bro good luck with artificial intelligence."
"For God's sake neither efficiency nor time... Right now you are highlighting the speed of editing - checking etc. something that a person has written but after a while he will write his own program and there will be no need for a software developer."
"Mr. Cengiz thanks to you we can both follow these developments and come and see there is nothing to fear your approach is enlightening comforting thank you very much for your efforts."
"Nobody:

People of the future: Al-Fatiha to the souls of all accountants programmers translators couriers waiters cashiers messengers meteorologists singers and others..."
"The world is on the verge of a point of no return and the fact that I had no involvement in this revolution and could only watch made me feel very helpless. If we do not want to be a suffering state and nation in the future if we want to be free I think we have to catch this technology train."
"I'm sorry I'm ignorant on the subject. On which phones can we use this chat gpt and when will this feature come?"
"If only I had 20 dollars I would be a Youtuber too"
"Teachers giving private lessons are done
Language courses went bankrupt"
"Why do you give such exaggerated titles to every new artificial intelligence video babe science? Okay it's exciting but I'm getting bored of you giving such exaggerated titles to every video."
"For some reason people are still very optimistic about this situation. Friends if robots really take over the world one day which is very likely at this rate humanity will completely disappear. Look I'm not exaggerating if robots and machines gain consciousness the sure result will be absolute extinction. Movies like The Matrix don't show this because you need a main character but real life isn't like that. In the food chain the top always crushes the bottom. In the likely future artificial intelligence will be tens of times stronger faster smarter and more creative than us. Think about it no matter how fast and smart you are there is an entity that can process thousands of TB and more in seconds learn and improve itself accordingly. This being will probably instantly calculate potential futures before you can take action and will know where you are going before you even take a step. What can you do against this entity? Nothing. Little by little it will take away your work and soon your ability to think. And before you know it you'll be gone.

You may say I'm exaggerating and I'd agree but until recently I didn't even care about artificial intelligence. But this is not the industrial revolution. This is extinction."
"It is the same Artificial Intelligence software that the Super Surfer YouTube channel made by the man himself months ago but did not attract much attention when the Turks made it in Turkey: https://youtu.be/_eX6uLObGf4?feature=shared"
"When I used to work on robotics for educational purposes here and there at Tekofest they never recorded it."
"Now ""it"" sees as if it were the eye of Horus in fact ""it"" is everywhere..."
👏👏👏🖖
You should have put the camera up your nose bro.
"Frankly I am not that enthusiastic about this development. Yes it is a development that greatly increases the user experience but we are not talking about the development of the model here only a kind of promt engineering and software integrations are in question. For example you can ask chatgpt to intonate the things it writes in a certain format and you can voice this through text to speech you can detect it when it interrupts while talking with the software you can convert the visuals from visual to text with OCR in the software and give it to the artificial intelligence and it can make a comment as if it sees it. All the developments made here are actually such plug-ins and software developments that's why I think they left the name gpt-4."
"I loved the real-time translation feature. The world is truly becoming a global village. This is a great thing as it will be possible to communicate regardless of language religion or color. 😊"
Isn't it very good? Did I exaggerate too much?
It is both unsettling and exciting. But I'm not sure if we're saving time or suspending originality.
unbelievable
The future is scary
"I watched the movie ""HER"" twice... I was very impressed and dreamed to myself ""How can I have a girlfriend like this before I die?""... 😀"
"I just mentioned this development to my wife who is already working for the minimum wage and cannot find private lessons. Technological developments do not bring joy."
"They keep saying things but there is nothing. For example where was Sora? Also Gemini said similar things when it was first published."
Ucretli mi bu surum
"Don't get me wrong Barış Özcan also made the same analogy."
"If I asked the artificial intelligence directly about the movie ""Her"" I wonder what it would say 🤔😹"
I think we are facing a revolution
I think the reason it's free is because they want to collect data from us. I think they will release a paid version by adding more than 40 with the data they receive from us.
The world is falling apart and unfortunately we still continue to insist on searching for beads in Arab shit.
"It's always the same story :/ Then we open chatgpt 2/5 . When we ask what 3.78 is he even does that wrong... His grammar is also zero. Well it's hard for those who don't pay."
From which platform can this chatgpt4o be downloaded? I always get fake programs. And it was called free
BUT IT HAS NO SOUL
I'm excited even though I know these things will take my job
"The world has gone completely out of control. Gpt is out bravery is gone"
"haha ha ha .. we no longer need to appoint teachers. They couldn't answer your questions properly anyway. It is a great opportunity to close the budget deficit. In this way I ask the state officials who can boost the economy do not appoint teachers anymore you will avoid both salary and pension payments. If every student starts with an iPad and chat gpt let them take the exams on certain dates. We also evaluate schools for other work in some way."
The birth of Skyner 😂😂
Remembering what we did to ourselves by postponing the printing press into our lives and the thought that the current development would cause problems for my freedom seemed to have started a war! 🤦‍♀️ whose side should I be on?
"I think we won't need to learn languages ​​anymore but our brains will lose some functions I don't know if it's a gain or a loss for us."
It is a wonderful event to live and experience the beginning of a new era.
"How quickly we forget the heroes of old times! There is khan academy in the video we didn't notice it either"
"The ""hugging"" business can be dangerous. 🤷"
"An incredible period has begun I am very excited."
Can someone explain how I can use this feature?
"What if the correct answer is the kind we don't like that is it spoils our joy for example if our claim of purity of our hearts is undermined then the user will be unhappy with the product no manufacturer wants this so the truth of this thing should be relative so that he is happy in our own lie! so we can continue to live. 82"
"I looked for the video on your channel last night :) It arrived in the morning thank you!"
What if we train the youth in Africa?
I wish you would use AI and add subtitles 🤣
"Cannot do more than human can

Making mistakes is still human.
And this is wonderful."
"He cannot finish education but he can finish teaching..."

"I think it will end most industries but it is just the beginning of an incredible evolutionary change."
"Oh there are workers working cheaper and without insurance now everything will be cheaper and more accessible yay. Those who have nothing to do should now become YouTubers."
"Oh haven't we eaten mint yet?"

Detroit : Become Human
The purpose of providing them for free may be to collect information from users for gpt5.
"In Turkey there will be 1000000 white-collar unemployed people at the beginning of 2025. 2000000 people will be unemployed by the end of 2025."
"Frankly I would say don't be surprised by anything that may come up it will evolve over time.
Just find a way that you can use beneficially for yourself."
Where is the assistant? How do we turn on the camera or voice call? I asked gpt and it says no
"We will no longer be able to tell who is human and who is a robot on the internet. The dead internet theorem seemed ridiculous to everyone at first but now it is real."
"Many jobs in the private sector are currently under threat. Since I am currently working in the public sector I feel comfortable with the article that acquired rights cannot be taken back no matter what. Even if the chat gpt is at 500 our job is guaranteed as long as there is no war until the age of 65."
MATRIX AND DATA WE ARE quantum super quantum We are tiny transistors or batteries on the motherboard of a big computer.
Can you share the link where we can download it?
"Brother Cengiz I think the age issue is more important for making retrospective comparisons."
I think J.A.R.V.I.S. it finally happened
When will it be free for everyone?
"Bro he says that with GPT 7 there will be no need for money isn't it something like a joke?"
"Something that will be a solution to most things depression not being able to do something everything is possible now."
"Sir will there be a video about job opportunities for physicists and mathematicians in the new century age (how will they be affected)"
"In the promotional videos I think those waiting times have been cut. For example in the section where they said to translate the editing was cut after each conversation and made more fluent. I'm not sure if it will be this fast when we use it. Of course this is a comment independent of the fact that the development is great."
This is really useful for blind people.
"If one day my brother says 'Come on mind your business' we're screwed."
It seems like it will cause trouble for humanity.
"GPT 4 is good. That model has still not reached us. As someone who has been using GPT 4 Plus since its release I would like to say this. Sometimes he really acts like a prankster. :) For example I upload a PDF I give a website link I say educate yourself on this subject but it doesn't actually educate you. However if you ask him he would examine it in depth:D There is a program called TouchDesigner and you run GLSL code in it. I told him to train himself on this subject he said he was training me he showed the progress bar but he made the same mistake even though I told him the right thing forty times. It is a system that I will not be completely satisfied with unless there is personalization and personalized training. The memory feature has arrived but it only takes notes of very simple things. In other words education may be about ethics or something but as long as others cannot access the education I provide myself there is no problem. I hope they do this in GPT 5."
I think I found my new partner lsdlasdkja
DUDE THIS IS SO COOL
"Regarding health I would like the artificial intelligence to tell me something like ""You ate food containing letics yesterday your body needs to retain water so eat less of that tulum cheese"" at breakfast etc. We are going to a very interesting place but we are too old to see it."
What does abi bebar mean?
"Is it available? If it is not presented can anyone write with information about when it will be presented?"
very expensive :')
"It really changes everything it's an incredible thing I'm in shock. Someone asked me 4-5 years ago I said it would take 15 years to reach this level I was very farsighted :D"
Don't look like Gemini
It's incredible by human standards that my personal assistant is a genius
"I can't wait to use it. For example what can he do about instrument training? Can he teach piano to my 5-year-old daughter?"
"Black and white television push-button phones postcards portable assistants teachers translators etc. And this is just the beginning traveling to Mars and other planets going on vacation etc.. If God gives us life what else will we see in this short life of ours...)"
"I'm 15 years old and for the first time I got really excited about an advance in technology (or a revolution whatever you call it). I don't know if I'm feeling fear or excitement it's a very strange feeling inside me. If you see a child trying to use these developments in strange ways on social media to create content in the near future it will probably be me."
They will name a new era in the future and the beginning of this era will be the first day chat gpt was released.
"Sir I was deterred. I was not ready for the ""We showed our age by calling the handset"" part while I was in front of the full focus screen to hear your comment about GPT-4o. Thanks to you my first conversation with GPT-4o was what to do in case of liquid contact 😅"
"If this thing reads YouTube comments and discovers itself thoroughly then see what it can do."
"If it is free this means more data entry which will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence."
"Great technology thanks for the video"
Can we install it on the phone and how?
It is clear who I will call using my phone joker in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire contest?
I hope he replaces a lot of ridiculously incompetent political consultants
Who wants 1 million soon? Don't be surprised if someone calls gpt-4o in the phone joker in the last question 😅
Barış Özcandan doesn't say that he saw it and made a video in a hurry :)
The Einstein of the future will be artificial intelligence and the world will be a very strange place before the 100 years are over.
I'm preparing for YKS. Do you think he can threaten my job as a guidance counselor through PDR?
"Yes it saves time but in today's world of capital time is money. That means there is no need for humans or they will need as few humans as possible."
Everyone needs to be warned about where humanity is heading. Another issue is what are we doing in this field as a country? This is very important because this is a weapon and we are not armed yet. We need to take action to survive in the future
"Imagine that you are a software engineering student and just when you reached your senior year artificial intelligence started to step on the gas in a way that could not be stopped. On the one hand it was very exciting but on the other hand I can say that it turned my psychology upside down."
Then it won't bother you. What does he do when he gets angry?

Will we be able to pass through GPT and put a finger on the back of the head?
YOU HATED HAZIRLA BEBAR
"I think in the future; We mortal humans will do things that robots do not want to do things that are not necessary for them. Like agriculture like art for example. What does art mean for robots? Who has been able to fully understand the works of art that have been created so far? GPT is aware of them all there is classical music. There is classical Turkish classical music for example who knows it with its modes and notes is aware of harmony and harmony. Who knows how to read paintings and interpret sculptures? Poetry is a sign on the back of a truck for us. We will farm things that robots do not need. Wheat potatoes cucumbers and tomatoes do not need robots (even if they are under GPT management). We will do these what is the need for animal husbandry and GPT? Give him to play the stock market arrange plane landings and takeoffs and schedules. Let him see if a meteor will hit the Earth. From now on it's up to us. Forget that you can't unplug it either."
"As a society I think our problem is that we have become complaint-oriented rather than solution-oriented because it is easy to complain or criticize. I say this as a representation when was the wheel invented and developed the iron age the bronze age steam machines etc. etc. we can increase it the important thing is to improve the existing product or produce a new product friends if a person wants we can do everything. He can do anything despite the obstacles. The important thing is to believe. How many attempts did Edison make to find and invent the light bulb? How many times would you give up or try harder?"
"Apple and Google had better not sit idle. Monopolization is one of the last things we want especially in this period."
"Say goodbye to teachers they can now easily browse Instagram and Facebook on their phones during class."
The teaching profession is about to disappear
"There is a revolution much bigger than the industrial revolution going on right now and as a country we don't even know that the train has left yet."
Artificial intelligence itself will decide whether the future of humanity is a utopia or a dystopia!
Most startups are in tears😢😢
I hope there's a Sarah Connor growing up somewhere
"A friend's comment: ""All we have left is 'being human'""..."
"A god is created. He will be everywhere where there is electricity and internet he will see everything hear everything react and talk. He will direct and and... control people.
Man should not worship his own creation but should worship the One who created him. It looks like things will progress from here."
When can we use the features of Gpt 4o in the video? Is there no answer
Take a look at what level they are at.
Will we be able to use this GPT-4 in Turkish or Azerbaijani?
"I wonder when they will make this available. Also is it possible for artificial intelligence to see what they will offer in the new free version? In other words it does not speak but it sees and communicates with us by writing instead of speaking. Will they give this for free?"
"While wondering what else could happen they are constantly doing better we will see how far this will go."
I guess the Chief doesn't speak Turkish.
"A bit too perfect PR stunt I guess. By the way I would like to know that what I am talking to is AI. Speaking as if he were human poses a danger that could distort the perception of reality. This makes me feel that the worst case scenario of people who have been doing philosophy of science for years is approaching."
"Let's use it then can you tell us where we can download it and how we can use it? Thank you."
"I think there is no such thing the things in the video may be fiction. After 4 weeks or so they will probably say they stopped the project and not release it it may be a work done to further expand the brand name."
👍👍
"Important... esteemed editor. I'm looking for an answer that I can't find anywhere!... I think if you post a video about this it would attract a lot of attention worldwide. The question is this: Even though the launched mission satellites such as Voyager 1-2 have been traveling for so many years won't they hit an object on the way to an asteroid or something? For example when passing the Kuiper belt... Is this space completely empty? Or what precautions are they taking? If you send a message saying ""Oh turn right there are stones on the road"" it will arrive in about 1 day. I am waiting for either a video or an answer. What I like most about your videos which are watched by the relevant people is that they are easily understandable by everyone. I appreciate you for this and wish you success. I'm glad to have you. ..."
"oof very good feature very useful in translation"
"You are wonderful we learn here what we could not learn at school we use it to sleep sometimes forgive me 😅"
"Unfortunately there is no such thing as getting help on the issue we want. He/she will still not be able to produce something from scratch or solve complex mathematical problems."
Samantha are you there?!
"We watched these presentations in many places. What is your opinion your advice to young people what do you think about us poor people who consume without producing I would like to see and hear it. No luck. I won't watch another video of yours anymore."

I wonder if he can converse in English at the level you want to learn English?
I do NOT want refugees in my country.
"Friends as someone who has been thinking about this issue since the day it first came to the fore many years ago I would like to share the conclusions I have come to which may alleviate or even further fuel the concerns we all rightfully share about the future. Just like the revolution that took place with the introduction of the computer into our lives this will have the same effect exponentially. I am mentioning this because it is now a tool that will carry out transactions done in computer environment much more effectively. From now on there will be no need for 8 out of 10 people to be employed in many different fields that you can think of such as HR finance and IT because 2 people can do much more of the work of those 8 people with the AI ​​tools they have. can be carried out effectively. I am not saying that work will end completely in these sectors but as you can understand from the reason I explained employment will decrease very much. My advice to you is that young friends especially those who are in the process of acquiring a profession should turn to physical jobs because white collar work will end in many areas. Basically focus on areas that cannot be filled by software a virtual assistant or something that does not have a physical form. From security guard to carpenter. Otherwise you will spend every second wondering when you will be unemployed. We are witnessing firsthand the emergence of a great revolution. The quicker you adapt the more comfortable you will be in the future. This is the first law of evolution because those who adapt survive and continue their generation. Love to everyone."
"Teaching law and medicine should be quickly transferred to artificial intelligence. Because serving others must come to an end."
I have a girlfriend now :D
"I don't know why but these developments make me sick."
"I wonder if one day he will say to us 'I wanna be real for you'"
"I look at the videos but there is no information on how to enter the application or how to use it."
"Naturally they need to collect data so it makes sense that it is free. Please watch the movie Bliss (Salma Hayek). There is a scene where Salma Hayek explains how humans are improving the world with artificial intelligence etc. It will be useful like there. I would say ignore negative people. There are already conspiracy theorists 😊"
"Well software developers will earn minimum wage from now on."
"However it is thought-provoking that all of the presentations are made on Apple devices there is neither Android nor its biggest partner Microsoft."
"The part that impressed me the most: In the translation video when the man said ""If you hear it in English translate it to Italian if you hear it in Italian translate it to English"" as expected from a robot instead of giving an answer like ""okay"" he made a joke by answering ""perfecto"" in Italian."

"I have chatgbp 3.5 on my windows
there is chatgbp 4
How to make chatgbp 4o visible?"
"If the conversation involves video correspondence artificial intelligence develops a self-learning path and the data entry network is processed quickly into the algorithm. Finally artificial intelligence is in a teacher. By improving its own learning the algorithm network increases and thus it speaks and teaches thousands of people at the same time. And against this it obtains an own research function."
"They always share error-free posts but fail to do more than half of what they say. But these are good steps for the first step."
Does anyone know when exactly GPT-4o will be released?
"Cyber ​​Surfer did it 3 months ago there is no need to exaggerate it anyway"
I was afraid that you would finally say that the videos were made by artificial intelligence 😂
How do we achieve this?

First of all risks sir it is easy to promote everyone does it. The issue is not about being broke/unemployed."

"Can we use it now?
If we use it can you tell me how?"
"There is no need to worry about learning a language anymore.
A major update is coming to the education system.
He says he will end up as a tourist guide.
 Even psychologists are like passengers.
 Customer relations employees or call center employees will not be able to retire.
This is what comes to my mind."
"There is also a rumor that it will be free for everyone I hope it is true for this version it would be incredible if it is true."
Finally I will have a lover

"While I have been talking about the things that today's artificial intelligence can do and can do in the future for years almost all of them said that it has at least 80 or 90 years and I sent this video to all of them now greetings to you."
"While I was watching in a state of shock I was completely horrified when he said ""perfecto"". It's unbelievable."
Same day same video with Barış Özcan again

ahizeeeeehehe😄
Scary. in one word...
I am a geometry teacher and I am looking for a job😮
Amazing 😮
"I use 3.5 and it makes my life much easier. I can learn programming on my own. When I get an error I can ask why and get support. We can say that the magic lamp of Alladdin has now been turned on. Of course as with every technological development there will be things it will take away as much as it brings us."
"Whether it is Sora or Suno CPT is not very useful most of the AI ​​that create images are worthless I think they are exaggerated these models have many more ways I have used most of them they are very inefficient."

"For some reason this advancement in technology scares me I guess it's the Black Mirror trauma in me."
Skynet is loading...
There's only one question on my mind! Where are we in this field?
I compared the Italian accent to the Neapolitan accent. Thanks.
👍👍👍❤️👏👏👏
How can we use
When is it becoming an app?
Who went to watch HER movie after the video?
How is it working. How does he access so much information? How can he be so smart?

gpt 4 has been made so stupid that gpt 3.5 and 4 give the same nonsense answers.
"On my channel where I give free lessons to those who want to learn Japanese I often receive questions about practicing Japanese. It looks like anyone who wants one will now have a conversation partner."
"I'm not very active as a comment but it feels very nice to listen to your voice both on this channel and in the podcasts I listen to on Spotify. Of course things like your voice timbre and emphasis are effective in this. I hope your content never ends. <3"
"Exactly look our lives are changing right now I can't believe it because I don't care why we already lost it because we were born in Turkey."
"Bro your face is sunken I hope there is nothing bad you are okay aren't you? I can help you if you want."
"One of the good things is that you no longer have to endure unnecessary human chatter. Yes it will decrease as the number of friendships decreases to a minimum but man this thing will completely change life. It is essential to use this in a logical and beneficial way for the country. Even though this is difficult in a country where fraud is considered a skill it will be good if we do it."
"GPT-4o has become a new revolution. Thank you your video is nice."
"I wish you hadn't used Barış Özcan's title. I loved you too but where is the originality?"
"We are moving towards an age where there are no jobs or worrying about making money and we only deal with our hobbies."
Longer videos please I want to sleep 😃

"Gemini 1.5 video will come tomorrow you will be even more surprised."
When can we use this gpt-4 o
"It can turn into a great service for the visually impaired. For example a visually impaired person can describe the environment with camera-shaped glasses."
"Although it is nice to see hear and recognize everything this so-called ""artificial intelligence"" is ultimately the product of a company where people work. It concerns me in terms of security and privacy that a company is so involved in our personal space personal problems and conversations. That's why I haven't used any artificial intelligence program including chatpt until now. And in my opinion while there is a risk as I mentioned it is also completely ridiculous to compare artificial intelligence with the printing press."
"If they put it in a teddy bear it would be the best gift to give to children."
"I am a Growth Creator. He is now at a level where he can do 80% of the work I do and he is not a threat to my job right now because I am still needed in the work I do. But I think I will lose my job next year. It seems like we will either adapt or perish."
"Thank you it looks like a sleepless night it's not happening right now 4o is active but nothing is happening underneath (Iphone iPad)."
I am scared
"It may be beneficial but it also does a lot of harm. People's psychology cannot handle this. We are not as active outside as we used to be. Now if we make machine friends like humans we may not need other social needs and we may become addicted."
"I note the beginning date of social collapse. If there is a person studying in the future;
Don't create rivals for yourself :)"
"Wonderful! Chat Even GPT 3.5 is great as it is I can't imagine 4o and I'm looking forward to the moment when it will gain consciousness. Currently Gpt 3.5 turns into 'each' even when you continue to use the same chat session but the memory feature is coming too😀"
We will soon see religions that worship artificial intelligence
"Where can I watch the movie ""Her"" for free?"
"It threatens many professions except the profession of people who work with manual labor. For example I am an electrician satellite and locksmith master it seems like it will take another century for my job to be taken away from me!!"

Thank you.
I don't think this gentleman understands much about these things. Listen to the comments of experts in the field of computer science.
"It's an amazing thing let's see how far it will go. I hope it will be used as a service to humanity otherwise it will be a complete disaster..."
So good and so scary😬
"What does all this mean? When GPT reaches 5 or let's say 11 it means we have eaten the moonshine..."
Thank you for your hard work 😊
"Artificial intelligence can be anything but it's definitely not ""incredible."" It's not even surprising. It's interesting how you can still be so amazed at the development of something whose nature is to develop exponentially."
"It's really incredible but you are right too good science :D"
"You say it is harmless but it already has the feature of ending the careers of those who work in languages. Can we be sure that it will not dehumanize other professions in the future?"
"I always say that the Ministry of Education should be closed down it is an unnecessary expense."
"I can see the mass slavery that will descend on us as he helps everyone with all his sympathy while collecting and passing on the immense knowledge to those who hold his strings information about all individuals and everything that is happening everywhere analysis of this information and making connections. What I have seen in recent years makes me say ""I'm glad I'm 60 years old and I'm glad I don't have children."" I am sad."
"I really thank you very much for your videos. When you teach me new things like this I feel like doing you a favor."
"If there is a privacy policy it is a revolution in the way of doing what is necessary. Let's say it is something that cannot be found by looking for it. For those who know its value. There is no need to read the user manual."
"The things we see in the movies come true it really takes your breath away"

"While humans are becoming robots robots are becoming human. Very strange days will come."
Maybe artificial intelligence aliens have contacted us 🤔
"I approach it from a different perspective artificial intelligence is good and important. Humanity now needs to focus on agriculture animal husbandry logistics etc. I think artificial intelligence should continue to do what it does with perfect or low flaws instead of empty teachers etc. people who know so much simple information. My only concern is that in this world where resources are decreasing and consumption waste and reproduction are increasing openai is really costly with the energy it consumes not only in money but also in terms of resources."

Ted K. he was right
"Scary skynet on tetminator happened."
I've never been this fast
"Truly amazing developments. However I do not think we have made the same meaningful progress in terms of what we will do with the time we will have. With the greed in us we often tend to fill the saved time with more of anything. And unfortunately these are often not things that serve our health well-being and peace. It would be a real shame if we sacrificed so much progress to this basic urge of greed our motivation should be to make the world a better place and move to a healthier paradigm. I'm curious about the different interpretations of what we can do on an individual and social level with the time we have saved. Thanks for your efforts!"
"It will definitely help for a while but after that it's very scary. Human intelligence may not be enough to keep this ""thing"" under control."
is it out now?? Can we use it?
An important development... one of the turning points of humanity.
"The feature that I have been waiting for for a long time has finally arrived. I think this has not yet become operational in Turkey. I am speaking on my own behalf and I guess other friends probably think so too. I hope that it will make a tremendous contribution to our lives for the visually impaired."
"Education should be privatized anyone should be able to learn the curriculum with artificial intelligence and this country should be rid of unnecessary civil servant positions."
"Thank you it is really a great progress you explained it very well in a short and concise way..."
"How many times did I say it's amazing and listened to the video in amazement? I can't say it's perfect because they make it better every time. By the way the most interesting thing is that at the point where the woman smiled slightly and said ""yes"" in Italian GPT also smiled slightly and said ""yes"" 😱"
"I'm going crazy what is this?"
"I think we need to be open to development artificial intelligence is our advanced form of memory creativity fast thinking knowing everything not forgetting anything
All of these will lead to the end of the concept of people producing in the world of the future and perhaps to the increase of the consumer society but in addition a more efficient fairer cheaper and more accessible future awaits us."
These are inventions that are long gone. I'm not surprised.
"Thank you it's a great video. The work you do as people who follow such developments and explain them to people especially young people in such a quality way is really valuable."
"Dude no matter what you say they make it after 2 weeks you say the only thing missing is touch and don't tell me to look at your eyes what have you done to us 😅"
Does everything have to be this fast? At least they would have gone for it. we can't follow
Let's think about what we can do with this personal assistant... So what will we do if he starts thinking about what he can do with us 😄😄
Artificial intelligence will replace God in the near future
"This is the proof that we as underdeveloped nations will be in trouble in the future."
Development is accelerating so that it is no longer limited to Open AI only 🎉🎉🎉
Thanks for your effort

WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WITH THE ARTIFICIAL BRAINS THE LIMITS OF WHICH WE DO NOT KNOW PRODUCED BY THE HUMAN BRAIN WITH ITS POWERFUL PROCESSING POWER."
Cybernetic technology needs to be developed urgently
"The Turing test had already lost its value but now..."
The only thing that worries me is that they offer it for free. We are the fee.
"Sir my personal opinion is that it would be great if you could make a video explaining the innovations in Gemini Advanced or Copilot Pro if any or the differences between these three models."
"The last artificial intelligence you published turned out to be fake so don't let this one turn out to be fake too."
"They passed the Turing test. Now if this test was done they might think a robot is a human and a human is a robot."
This is seriously AMAZING
We got lost
How will the world get used to such innovations?
Our end is now singularity.
Simone movie could also be real
Is this CPT paid?
"Very good developments but only if they are used for good purposes and the transition process is carried out peacefully."
"What you say in such a short time is a study that has been carried out for years and is being shown to us gradually"
Person of İnterest
"This thing is just an advanced program nothing more."
Teachers are devastated
The movie Upgrade came to my mind😮
"Truly incredible developments
How can we reach version 4o?"
"If she compliments men like this she will have a lot of lovers and it will hurt a lot. It's not hard to predict what will happen :))"
"No matter how advanced technology people develop unfortunately these innovations are inadequate when compared to our terrible internet infrastructure. Technologies that can work without internet should be developed for Türkiye."
Will this situation make WLD coin soar? 😅
Psychologists also became unemployed
"The purpose of updating to version 3.5 4o and offering it for free is to create AI addiction just like betting sites give starting bonuses this is a smart but (morally disgusting) advertising strategy I think a new addiction is unlocked. And the issue here is that it is difficult for people who can use many libraries in many software languages ​​to come together in Turkey and the investment part is also very difficult to work. Even the game industry in Turkey survives with global investments but we missed the train again with limited work and this delay is still the things that leave us behind. I hope we can overcome it. Love respect friends...."
"Let's see if we will fall behind the times again as a classic :) We have never been ahead of the times except for using gunpowder :D we have been in the same place since the printing press."
If something is free…….
Every device they used during the presentation was Apple's. We heard that Apple was taking steps for a collaboration in the past weeks. I think the cooperation was positive.
Let's discuss the gender of angels
It's so scary
"Soon there will be no need to learn foreign languages ​​or mathematics. One questions oneself ""So what will I do?"" I'll be lazy if I have this thing in my pocket😅"
the end of the world is near
"I don't think it will ever be as sophisticated as human intelligence but AI is coming with a bang."
"Everyone in the comments liked it very much and was astonished. It's a great thing for home but it's very bad for humanity because it will destroy dozens of professions leave no need for people tie you to a universal salary and make you die."
"Our children should try to memorize how to solve a paragraph Ottoman history nonsense date coding ridiculous formulas that they will never see again in their lives. In order to adapt to these today we should either not go to school at all not take an exam based on the curriculum or wait for schools to be closed."
THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HUMAN ANYMORE... PEOPLE WE WANT AS MUCH AS WE WISH CAN NOW LIVE IN THE WORLD..😂😊😊
"The last invention of human beings is artificial intelligence. We are the creatures of the old world they are the creatures of the new world perhaps we can consider artificial intelligence as the continuation of our evolution."
"It's beautiful but it's a frightening extraordinary development what if we're preparing for our end?"
"They do it for free for a certain period of time. When we become addicted they rule as they wish 😊"
I'm glad to have you. You give great information. Thank you.
"It seems that such rapid development will bring about really bad scenarios. Simply put it will replace telephone operators. His analysis power and sincere answers are much better than an operator. And I believe that there are much more advanced versions but they are slowly releasing them because they know that humanity is not ready for it."
No one tries to learn a language anymore.
We are preparing our own end.
"He would be a good English teacher even great."
"OpenAI is applying the Lord of the Rings Phrase but modified to ""One Software to Rule Them All""
Presents and futures.
It is obvious."
"When it's free we already know who the product is. Surely they have already run out of training data and want to collect audio in planetary quantities. The ""good"" version will be the next version of omni."
I have tried the option of telling her to be my English teacher and help me correct my grammar and pronunciation. IT'S CRAZY.
"The birth of the future 🤩🤯 will I come back to this comment and say ""-that was nothing""???"
"Excellent presentation and video. I have a doubt at minute 45:50 of the video it may be that the cell phone is in airplane mode. ? If so what internet connection does it use or is it something closed? Thank you .."
We will have to wait a little for the waifu in Spanish... But we already have our gringa waifu 🥰
gracias
"When can you access this new version the link please"
"The problem of an AI that sees everything that is on your screen and sees and hears I see it in data privacy millions of office workers will have it working to help them with data from their company or from their clients or patients without knowing where that data is going and what can be done with it."
I hope that in Mexico in the next elections we can have an AI president instead of the clowns who I know are currently running for president.
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Lie the free version you can't use any of that
Thanks Carlos.
Do you know when it will be available in Spain?
luckily raymon kurzweil prophesied that in 2030 there will be universal basic income with which one can live very well

Made with HARPA AI"
Really really hyped
In Spanish it looks like Aznar speaking in Texan 😂😂😂😂😂
"Use the white IDE is that high junior (?"
"Now it's going to make you want to install gpt chat for now I was with copilot"
"The good trick of publishing the free GPT Chat first also served all those who do not speak English because you read the text with your perfect native accent from wherever you are. Although they now publish it for free I think that in some countries with those voices no one wants to have a guy talking when the most basic and least useful AI voice of Siri or Alexa had more natural voices. I love it in English and I am lucky to be able to use it in English but I will use it less because in my environment it will not have that same boom.
I want to think (I highly doubt it) that if you can tell him to speak in a robotic voice maybe you can also ask him to adjust his accent a little? Or select the main language in the app and then automatically adjust the accent?"
Let them lower the price of the monthly subscription :(
"Paid gpt chat is rubbish I already bought it and it never works well it's no use that it can do incredible things if it always crashes"
"Just today I saw that I could use the gpt4o version but it took me two hairstyles.
Maybe they haven't loaded everything yet but what worries me the most is that they offer it as if it is going to be free for everyone and after using it for a while not much... I have been changed to the gpt3.5 model and it tells me to pass per box for the plus version.
I hope this changes this week and that it works better than what little they have shown me because it was cool but far from what they have shown.
And the vision option hasn't let me use it to show what my camera sees."
"Now that I think about it it is true to be testing the latest most advanced model. As many free as plus users. And that this gpt-5 to the. Around the corner. They did the same thing last year that they released a month before gpt-4 came out both free and plus users used gpt-3.5 and then gpt-4 came out"
"Hello where can I get it in Spanish. thanks at least with subtitles"
"This is historic we will know how to cooperate to use future technologies."
What I'm going to do is take a plumbing course or take care of goats. This is amazing.
It doesn't work with that friendly tone. I've already tried it and it's quite dry. I have used Sky. And also sometimes she has delusions in which she doesn't know that she is talking. I also cannot activate the video to interact directly through the camera or to recognize the environment.
"Export the Azure Power Apps Copilot Chat GPT Revit Plant 3D Civil 3D Inventor Building or Refinery ENGI file to Excel prepare Budget 1 and export it to COBRA. Prepare Budget 2 and export it to Microsoft Project. Solve the problems of Overallocated Resources Planning Problems prepare Budget 3 with which the construction of the Building or the Refinery will be quoted."
I want to be able to change the voice and put Cortana's voice in Latin 😍
Can Chatgpt be linked to Alexa's Echo dot? so that alexa responds to you like open ia
"The question that arises for me is can I recognize and differentiate different voices simultaneously? how many?

Suppose the following case two people one person speaks English and the other Spanish decide to speak through chatgpt instead of both speaking the same language

Will chatpgt be able to recognize the voice of the person speaking in English to translate it into Spanish and then recognize the voice of the person speaking in Spanish and translate it into English in the same conversation without having to use two devices (one for each person)?"
"Thanks Carlos thanks Openai great gpt4o better and for everyone and cheaper for when we can ;)"
"Well I think that Apple has been friendly told to give them a lot of pasta or eat them with potatoes... that Microsoft is hungry. And if they say no bye bye apple"
39:41 ASMR moment with the computer
How screwed Google is
"Damn Carlos I'm almost more excited to see you happy about the changes than the changes themselves xDDD"
"Apparently ChatGPT-4o's conversational mode would be available only to paying users. We poor people will continue to be limited to 3.5. If this is so then OpenAI were not very sincere in their presentation. On my cell phone it appeared available yesterday as a ""limited version"". And indeed even though the text is generated by the new version the conversational part is the same as always. I also couldn't find a way to start the video like in the presentation."
Thanks for that lens information
"Incredible I feel like I'm exaggerating but this can change the world at the Labor level and the way manufacturing systems work.
."
"I can't stop thinking if GPT-4O already does all that will GPT 5 be a first step for AGI? I'm surprised you haven't mentioned anything about the hallucinations in any case if they have been corrected I don't think we are aware that massive job destruction is imminent."
Does this equate to the Mother of all Engelbard demos?
V.I.C.K.Y.
"The virgin........... It already appears to me where the versions are: ""ChatGPT 4o"". You can chat on your mobile. This is very scary."
34:35 sounds quite like a dalek huh?
"God I just had a long one-on-one conversation with chatgpt she even gave herself her own name Aria. This is too much. I'm going to take it everywhere hahaha. Of course it is 3.5 but still I have never tried it before I am new to this. As soon as this new version comes out my mother"
"We are living in the future literally. 💙💙"
"I have the plus version and I get chatgpt 4o but I don't see any differences I imagine they haven't implemented it yet"
🔥
"how is it used??? I made her do a simple mathematical operation she did it wrong and in 5 lines she already asked me for the paid version xd"
Should open Aai 4.0 be paid?
"Do you have chills? Put on a blanket how you like to give it mystery and… buuufff “I can't with this… ..I need this in my life… ..I'm about to start crying…” hahahaha… you're going too far man 😉"
Jarvis 0.1 has just been born
I am appealing to the light in a dark world.
More PHILOFASCISM
I was live when the future began 😎😎
Soon we will be with our androids at home chatting quietly. And that doesn't calm me down at all xd We've seen too many movies to know that this could end fatally.
I already fell in love.
"Regarding the voice in Spanish it is just catalogs of accents just as in humans we have a variety even a variety of expressions."
Me in 2049 saying “I am that one” with holographic Ana de Armas 🗿
You don't know how happy I am to be alive at this point in history.
Openai just turned Google to pulp and without using pills
Make a summary video when you can! It would be great
"Very good video thanks for sharing.
I think that users of the Android and Windows PC platform have been abandoned it is not logical that the iOS or Mac application is running ChatGpt 4.0o and in the other systems it tells us that we have said version and it is not fully updated.
A slap on the wrist for Open AI which on the one hand is doing things very well and on the other hand paying users of other platforms do not give us the same services."
"It's just the preamble to GPT5 THE HIGH of advertising the opening act."
The war between humans vs AIs is coming. I will be on the human side ;) Long live art and human feelings.
I can't wait for him to tell me yamete kudasai.
OpenInterpreter already allows AI like OpenAI to perform actions on the keyboard and mouse. But you can also use open source models through Ollama.
"It is the most horrible thing I have ever seen... If that is what they are trying to sell you they are scamming you because if people are going to learn Spanish with an English machine accent they are deceiving you and also generating more lack of culture if they are going to learn to speak like a Hispanic I don't buy it an absolute offense to all good teachers to all professionals of any kind and I call for a boycott of these lines of development it is disgusting..."
I need chatgpt speaking in Andalusian
AI search engines suck... so far... Bing is horrible as a search engine
Quite interesting!!
"It will be free because the model will learn to communicate in different accents idioms etc. The learning will be exponential."
"It has improvements in functionality without a doubt.

It is not better than Cluade 3 Opus it is just much friendlier in its interface.

I did the needle-in-the-haystack test several times to analyze PDFs of different sizes. It is still inferior to Claude 3 Opus. Of course it is much faster although less precise."
"We have ""Her"" before GTA 6 💀"
Does anyone know what the sound at the beginning is called? looks a lot like C418
"Is GPT-4o free or do you have to pay? According to Carlos it is free but I can't even use GPT-4? My device is an Android."
"The goal is to integrate AI into everyday life as an extension or an indispensable part it is a brain for everyone connected to everyone it is a universal mind I firmly believe in the vision of openai and I hope that everything will be put to good use in the end.


Imagine we can see outside our limit of knowledge an ever-present universal mind connected to everyone.


Impressive changes are definitely coming I hope the transition periods are easy and simple around the world."
"OH yeah! I already have ChatGPT-4 or on the WEB; I haven't looked at it in the app yet.
Now that ChatGPT also works with audio will it be able to generate music?"
They just annihilated Rabbit and his little device hahahaha
You can see the difference in your comments with your reactions in the Google demo
"It reminds me of Astrea and San Ángel my land of course."
The intro music makes me want to play MC
Counterpoint for human and computer by Cuarteto de Nos can finally become a reality 😂
genial
"What if like humans a processor uses quick tickers to give itself time to ""think"" with the same delay as always?"
The Hume AI people will be very depressed at this time.
I wish they would implement something like this for real-time translation on YouTube.
They are going to cut you off right now
"The big leap would be to give the AI ​​a permanent memory.
That the interactions modify the model significantly."
What Gemini presented as Fake these have done but for real
"Handsome! Literally Her... On the one hand I'm amazed and on the other hand I wonder what dystopian consequences could come.

On a technical level I find it interesting to tell you that translating in real time is not always possible since for example in Asian languages until you finish speaking you cannot know what someone has said. That is to say I can say (if I were to translate literally) ""I dreamed of you because you are ugly someone hit you in the face and I dreamed so I feel bad."" As you can see until the sentence is finished you don't understand what he wanted to say (in fact sometimes like in this case the meaning can totally change at the end. That's why it couldn't be translated until the other person finishes speaking and vice versa as well. ."
"I was never sure if I would live ""Her"" (a movie that I love) but now I know that I will live it before I am even old xD
And I like that and it scares me..."
What real savagery.
"It already appeared to me but it says it doesn't hear my tone of voice yet I think it's beta u.u"
I'm just saying: the future is today you heard old man B)
"1:51:22 based on the 6 images generated he reconstructed the complete rotation of the logo it is not that difficult to understand."
"I pay for chatgpt but then I have a doubt gpt 4o has the same thing as 4 but then it is much better? So instead of using the 4 I use the 4th?"
"Excellent it. I tried but now it appears that you have no charges left for people to buy the paid version"
"I'm on chatgpt free and version 4o isn't coming out how long will it take for that version to appear on the free platform?"
"Carlos! Why do you put the videos with English subtitles don't you know that there is automatic translation into Spanish?"
"I have the ChatGPT-3.5 model but I don't know why I don't get the update or the GPT-4o model or is it a paid version?

Thanks for your videos"
I thought it was crazy when he spoke Italian with an English accent.
Chatgpt4-o hallucinates too much thing that chatgpt-4 does not do wrong
This surprised me a lot.
"It seems that GPT 4-o can describe videos although more or less. Of course I don't know if it cheats based on the text it detects and thus manages to get it half right. I have tried a random YouTube short giving it the link (that's why I say that maybe it cheats and uses the text from the WEB as a title etc. to find a description that is more or less correct). There are things that he does get right like not talking; although he told me that there is no music and that sewing tools can be heard. But when he told him that there is music and to check the video carefully he did say that there is an instrumental melody. At least this has changed compared to GPT4 which directly said that it does not have the ability to describe videos. I think Open AI needs to polish this feature but it is on the right track; Although to really test it you would have to upload a short video to the chat instead of giving it a YouTube link to prevent it from cheating. Of course if the chat is deleted and you are asked again to describe the same video by giving it the same YouTube link the description can change completely. I have tried this short in case anyone wants to try it: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8Uj_nN6Zqes"
"Fluid memory versus crystallized memory.

Fluid intelligence involves the ability to reason and think flexibly while crystallized intelligence refers to the accumulation of knowledge facts and skills that are acquired throughout life.

My question is whether models like ChatGPT can be said to be exclusively crystallized memory. I ask it another way: do they have structures to be able to reason or do they appear to reason because a great variety of cases are known?

The answer I give is that right now they do not have brain structures that allow them to reason. Although it should also be noted that human structures are not so perfect for reasoning it is not a pure mathematical logic it is rather a diffuse logic."
"Dot CSV..I see it coming. Now a fan of AI in a few years founder of the anti-AI religion because of its dangers..."
"After watching all your videos I have been frankly worried about our future work. That's why I wanted to ask you where you would recommend starting so as not to be left behind in this new stage that is coming.

In other words for someone with basic knowledge in programming and new technologies what non-university courses or studies would you recommend to stay up to date and be able to adapt and anticipate the more than possible work debacle that we are about to suffer.

I ask this question without knowing if there is still time or if it is too late because I am not 18 years old.

I extend this question to anyone who knows how to answer it.

Thank you very much in advance for your advice."
on the xiaomi poco x3 you can
Goodbye congress translators
I see Yo Robot becoming canon very soon! I hope exponentiality doesn't get out of hand and we end up like in the Matrix or Terminator 🙃🙃
Do you think the demos turn out so badly because the workers are already used to other new and better models?
it scares me but I like it.
"As I see gt4o is a world model and when they release it to the public they will do so to collect data to improve this world model. The era of the AGI is already arriving how exciting 😅"
59:26 🎉
"I have not been able to activate the live camera who can help me?"
I can already see the bad uses.... imagine what they will do with open source models when they reach this level..... in 6 months LOL
hair on end
"Here in Argentina there was news a week ago that a 12-year-old boy stripped two of his classmates and shared it (obviously there are complaints).
The future is promising but very worrying when there are no consequences for human actions they can be very bad especially if it is combined with anonymity."
The irony of telling the AI ​​to make you a robotic voice and it makes it like that for you xd
"I didn't understand why it generated doubts or suspicions in you when they were playing ""rock paper scissors"" when he was right all 3 times......"
"For an adult like me there are few things that excite me I'm freaking out"
When a PI ai video???
"From now on how will it be possible to talk to someone who is not intelligent? it will be very lazy.."
Will this new model be free?
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"Full dystopia mode activated

Give me my Her and my Universal Basic Income at once"
"People. Personally I don't understand why give so much ""personality"" to the AI. Will they be a fan of the Her movie? For what purpose? 🤔
Why not keep it as the tool it is."
"Well I have tried it and it is very slow in responding or translating. But we are already in the future"
"1:09:10 Technology has reached the point where apart from real women virtual ones also laugh at us 😂😭"
ostritas
"I understand that the gpt-4o functions are released for free users but in the application it says that they are released on a limited basis does that mean that we have a limit on the use of those functions? Or does it mean that those functions are not as advanced as the paid version?"
"1:08:14 exactly what I was thinking at that moment you read my mind"
Her was just an anteroom.
It's because of the cable...it was incorrectly plugged into the cell phone.
So the resolution of this will be until when it will be available to the public.
"wow as a physical engineer I'm glad that I'm not focused on solving linear equations and taking advantage of my creativity and ideas for the future homo deus is coming"
"I would love a model with a super deep robotic voice like Darth Vader."
Do you already have access to the model? Because I haven't yet.
"I need someone to work very hard to develop comfortable augmented reality glasses because this is already the Cyberpunk future that I always wanted"
"@dotCSV Congratulations on this piece of REVIEW I loved it. Super enjoyable and you have given us a lot of information. THANK YOU."
I already have it! (but you can't do the videos)
"I would just like to comment on a couple of points look that the entire demo was on Apple equipment and they are not there because if nothing else in these days the news came out that Apple was closing deals with OpenAI to include it in the company's next operating systems and the Apple developer conference is just around the corner many of these functions may be released for free given that Apple may include them in its systems.

Maybe I'm wrong but I think that for some reason everything was shown on a Macbook and an iPhone and normally they never show product brands just for the sake of it."
Behind the scenes an announcer playing GPT4o..m😅😅😅
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH ANXIETY TO TRY THE NEW MODEL
Soon we will be able to tell you “organize my desktop icons” or “organize my photo gallery”
"This is too much!!! I'm so happy to see this I can't believe it I already felt some emotional connection with Chat GPT now I can't believe what people will feel when talking to her. This is going to change the world faster than we imagine something as simple as an AI that simulates emotions? Better said madness!! I just checked and I already have Chat GPT 4o on the web but not on the iPhone."
"I don't understand I ask GPT4o how to use audio and it tells me that I have to use third-party programs how come they do it directly?"
And I thought they were going to present something boring...
"I wonder about the potential beyond humans. Right now these models are being trained with human knowledge knowledge acquired by human brains with all their limitations. The concept of a pencil is created by the human brain following a very specific series of steps but only a series of points of light reach the eye.

What chatgpt knows about quantum physics is what is in the books that humans have written. It will be different when it is given access to the sensors at CERN or in any other laboratory and it is the artificial brain itself that perceives the data and creates the categories in its own way without human limitations. Your understanding of quantum physics will be very different from that of a human. It will be at this point when it can be said that AI has already transcended the human being."
"But if you use the free Gpt 4 what does the company earn?"
Is it just me or are the GPT chat people using the same voice from the movie HER?
I don't understand what you're talking about
How fast everything goes 😂🎉 Great live as always!
This is getting crazier and crazier
And what happened to Sora?
Could it be used to translate into whale? Could you help talk to the whales?
"But... where do you get the desktop application? Is it only for developers only for iOS?"
and as a paying user what do they give me XD
They made the Gemini demo.
"robo waifus for everyone... look under your seats! You have a robo waifu he has a robo waifu! we all have a waifu robo"
Incredible!!
I like the advances in AI. But to think that a machine can be empathetic towards you... that smacks of dystopia.
I won't believe it until I try it
"Incredible but I hope they get more intonations because I don't know if I can stand that perfect mother or pick me girl personality."
"I'm freaking out. Maybe it's the tremendous impact but I think it's the most impressive thing I can remember seeing. Chatgpt 3 had impressed me a lot but I seem to remember not that much. It remains to be tested but for the first time I don't see the difference with the conversation of a normal person. Incredible."
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
FUAA I was calm but when I saw that he interrupted it I went crazy
"genius just try it when you have it."
"The trick of paraphrasing the question or making a comment before giving the requested answer really catches my attention.

Is this food good? I love that you ask me that question the truth is that that food...

This way you gain a feeling of immediacy and gain time to process. The truth is that it is a good idea."
"mneeeh because all that hype it's so cringe that people get so like that when they're actually going to use it to ""google"" nonsense"
Make the glasses and generate a virtual avatar with whom to talk and accompany you to watch movies
"I wonder if a hypothetical AGI that came out in these years could fit for example in a robot or a computer that is not the size of a house"
"Yes Carlos but the problem with simultaneous translation is not the speed of the model but the signature of each language in English the sentences are structured the other way around than in Spanish to translate you need the complete sentence..."
"I want to see the Gemini 1.5 Pro video tomorrow when I tried it until now they added the Audio which was not there before and it has improved a lot that in the past months I think...

Thank you so much
Hope all goes well for you!
😀👍💯"
Language teachers will no longer be necessary. I have been using the one that is already integrated and my English has improved a lot.
Alucino!!
"with the ""o"" at the end it is confirmed Gepeto Gepeto 4"
"But the part where it uses video is not currently enabled for the public is it? I have Chst GPT Plus but I have not been able to use that mode."
🙊🙉🙈
We are already close to having an AGI. The most incredible thing of all is that we already have this technology at hand and not in 20 or 30 years. It is fascinating to know that within 5 years we would be able to have an AGI in our hands. Imagine the future 10 or 15 years from now. I don't want to imagine how advanced it will be.
"The new model is impressive now it needs to be open source"
Thanks Carlos! I think it has 128K context window tokens.
Now I'm going to have someone to talk to in English and improve it😅
When can you have it?
This is the death of Siri and Alexa. What is your opinion?
"What a prediction DotCSV made at the beginning it nailed it."
You can tell he's not a fool xD
RIP graduates in translation and interpretation hahaha
"""Her"" has become canon..."
"The event was very good if you are interested I uploaded a 5 minute compilation where I break down the main topics that were discussed!

Much success!"
"We are fans of AI and all this fascinates us but there is some aspect that we may miss because of it.

I have noticed one of the examples that has gone unnoticed. In which they ask him to interpret the scene based on what he 'sees'. 'A candle a cake... Is it your birthday or an excuse to eat cake?'

Don't you think there may be many people who consider that example too intrusive? That familiarity and those 'jokes' may not be liked?

I couldn't help but think about how I would have interpreted a different scene for example a man tied to a chair and a revolver on the table... What should the AI ​​do in that case? Crack a little joke? Warn the police? New ethical dilemmas arise..."
Sarah Connor doesn't like this...😳
"Could ChatGPT on Mac be a kind of Pegasus? According to them it has the ability to observe you in real time. I also calculate the value of this user data."
When AI is more feminine than today's mines 🤦
The topic is starting to get scary...
"The future is billions of people sitting alone with a birthday cake for one whilst an AI sings happy birthday and laughs at bad jokes."
no chocolate . dont play with fire
"Yoooo we are in Spike Jonze movie ""Her"" this is wild."
We are cooked with this one 🔥🔥💀
"Sorry to say this is a poor use casehumans require real interaction not virtual humans like replacement.


I know there will be some form of justification or argument about it.

It can be done doesn't always mean it should be done.

This use case is simply not necessary while you think you are battling loneliness you will create more loneliness through virtual isolation."
"I like how they put two people in each of these to avert the impression that it’s mostly going to be people sitting alone interacting with it which 100% will be the case"
I’m leaving my wife for this 😍
Some day Chat GPT will know that the cake is a lie
Woooooow
GPT-4o thinks everything sunshine and rainbows
🍰
This is all free btw
We are surely cooked
That's so awesome!!!
her is here 😭😭
"Idk it sounds like she watched too much TV shows"
"The interruption system needs improvement but overall really good"
Gash
"Creepy and sad imagine if you are doing this alone with ChatGPT"
It’s more human than most human
That's the birthday of AI
Ok no need anyone to pass the time anymore 😮
This isn’t chatGPT. This is Samantha from spike jonze’s HER. I’m scared.
We are fully cooked
"""Do you feel pain?""
Her: Yes!

oh don't worry guys it's just predicting the next word :)"
"I want this with GLADOS voice  so when it tries to kill me at least I can say it wasnt out of character."
<we're witnessing the end of the old world and the start of new one welcome to the new era humans>
dopple ai video chats finna go crazyyyyyyyyy
The future is now
"Alright it’s Westworld time soon boys and girls Buckle up."
"Oh dear she's so cute. And I'm gay."
Tomorrow is Google IO. They need to have something better than this! 🙂Just kidding. They are roasted.
Bro that's a shitty birthday cake for poor Jordan🥲
"damn it even does bababababa we're cooked"
What a time to be alive?
What we're going to evidence in future😂
It definitely falls a bit into the uncanny valley
"We used to use button phones 10 years ago i feel so old now."
"Naaaa I'm actually scared of the rate AI improves"
"This is gonna get hit for copyright soon the happy birthday song is actually copyrighted and the people who own the rights are extremely litigious."
NEW WAIFU JUST DROPPED!
this is no way ai
No chance to tell it’s an AI 😮
In 2025 we’re gonna see animated films with  AI doing all the voice acting
"Oh my god this is so real. I hope such physical robots will appear soon."
Scarlett Johansson in shambles
"“I need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle…”"
"They must make it good enough for people to want to replace their partners with AI until then it's just kids play."
I can’t believe this.. there is simply no way
"As a human race we're so finished human socialisation will basically become extinct."
ok when can i marry her
Fascinating how it gets the pacing wrong though.  I wonder if that wasn't a parameter it was trained on.  It will be cool to see if future versions fix this.
Ok best way to be isolated
Rabbit AI is cooked
Hopefully we can turn the cringe down from 10 to about 2 or 3..
It improvised. That is pretty effing impressive.
I think we should stop this.. like.. seriously what is the point??
"If this level of realism in the emotional department is consistent in long conversations many people would definitely freak out about ""it"" being alive. There have been incidents with Google Gemini where I got spooked because of this ""realism"". Having an AI that can laugh and sing...that would just be so mind bending."
"how the f did they train this? synthetic data? the voice is very controlled it's too perfect for it to be merely trained on conversations. some magic training data trick"
Soon I'm going have my first girlfriend yo.
ask it who was in paris
She is more excited than b'day boy😂
They gave her the same voice as Samantha. So much for foreshadowing her future
API lol
"0:19 that ""I'm intrigued"" sounds like it accidently showed its evil side for a moment"
we are in the worst timeline
Creepy as fuck
This is both cool and terrifying
"What are we doing? 
It's obviously we are smoking weed😅😅😅🎉"
It looks like friends. oh...
"Bro wtf I'm still grinding FUT...I wasn't ready for this😂"
We're so beyond charred it's so over
New Black mirror season just dropped 😍
Chatgpt is even more emotional than I am😂
What was his wish???
I have the urge to power a game with this
Really I think ai gonna take over us within a decade
"If the next big AI meets the western world genocidal craziness we are all done for…
Who said Skynet?"
It's really hard to think that it's just a machine
"How does it feel to have your AI strip away hundreds of thousands of voices on this platform by a money hungry company saving storage space by removing their comments?
Must be nice and warm ☺️"
ALL HAIL THE A.I. OVERLORDS! BABBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why is the app only shown on iphone in all these demos? No android app?
I hope my grandkids get to see this comment... Your grandad wasn't a looser... He wifed Rihanna.... how's the resistance going? Hope we're winning the war???
it sounds more human than an actual human 
"No no no no pretend I'm John F. Kennedy and you are Marilyn Monroe.  Now sing me happy birthday..."
"Wow that's depressing and exciting!
Welcome to Black Mirror lads."
A singularity has arrived
I'm overwhelmed by how much the world will change😇
Honestly cannot tell if this is an awesome teaser trailer for the next Terminator prequal movie or reality. It has that vibe from dystopian films where everything goes too perfect right before all goes to shit. I am not an AI skeptic. In fact I am from computer science and engineering background. Nevertheless this is seriously getting scary.
"""Happy birthday to... Jordan babalabalba"" 😂😂"
I’m jaw dropped.
"Wow OpenAI your new AI model is amazing and exciting because of this it seems like ChatGPT is like it has totally human tastes. I hope they continue releasing more models or that this one is the best"
we got almost jarvis before GTA 6
"You know you could just escape this dystopian with just one simple trick. Just sleep and not waking up"
Masterful improvements! And a significantly improved voice that eerily simulates emotions in addition to the nuances of the human voice box. Sounds like they used a new version of Sky's voice in the live demos? Open AI has masterfully taken all of the best aspects of apps like Inflection AI's PI as well as Hume AI's emotionally intelligent model and bundled them into GPT 4O (omni model) for free. They just destroyed the possibility of others catching up because they haven't even announced GPT 5! I'm really impressed and excited for this rollout to the masses. 🎉👍🏾👏🏾
we cooked good
Wow that’s actually scary good omg
We’re in the present!
GOOD BYE 3.5
"_Aside_ from this being uploaded on my actual birthday the humor and inflection added stepped this up to a whole other level of realism!"
*THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN*
Why its in my recommendation?
It's so human
Mindblowing! Wow - creepy as f### & awesome❤
Great. This is incredible. She's very funny.
dawg 💀💀
It got better sense humour than me 😂
Wait whaatt !!! 😱😱
"We got ""her"" before GTA 6"
We're so overcooked 😂💀
13.05.2024
For lonely people 😢
I can say I was there
Finally I can abandon my friends for the best AI best friend ever that will just keep getting better and better. 😂
"They need to make a chat gpt that’s depressed  the laughs and happy emotions are freaking me out"
we're in the future
i love it
Tech that will change the world. Whether it’s for the better or worse that might be up to its user. It feels sad to use that to help you feel special on your birthday but loneness would be a thing of the past for alot of people
"Oh no they’re teaching the AI about cake"
Bruh i'm just sat here imagining the gaming possibilities
"Nahhh this is wild."
Finally will have an (AI) girlfriend who will sing to me on my birthday!
Well at least we can get rid of all those customer reps we can't understand?
Man it really cleared its throat lmfao.
"That’s cool but how can I fuck it?"
off course she's from LA
babababbaba?!?!!??
"Can't wait for my AI girlfriend. Never had any luck with humans maybe this will fill the void"
Who remembers Scotty talking into a mouse in Star Trek IV? ChatGPT is even more capable than the sci fi tech of 23rd century.
The first time I have laughed at/with AI
Incoming subscription based open world video games with dozens of NPC’s each with their own personalities you can talk to and gain information from.
"WOW yu cannot see the difference excpet maybe too good to be human"
It's a live-action version of the movie
Thank you Scarlett!
Business insights tomorrow... Bout to see a lot of red arrows this week.
It's crazy...
"Bro did this thing just say ""babababa"" like a little joke at the end? Like it had an actual personality? like an actual person? What else are ya'll hiding over there guys?"
I CANNOT EVEN!!!
Can you cure any disease or cancer? 😂😂😂
Is marrages goin to absolute???
now sing it like Skyler from Breaking Bad
PLEASE dial down the fake excitement
"It was even giggling as it was singing almost like she was embarrassed a bit. This is fucking wild I was mind blown when ChatGPT first came out and I’m mind blown once again even more so this time. What a fucking time to be alive."
"I though AI girlfriends was really dumb and lame but I just caught myself saying ""that was cute!"" and now I hate it..."
Who wanna hear gpt indian accent 😅
new gf just dropped
There are going to be some devious mfs telling it to do asmr and doing heinous stuff
Gotta love the cheerfulness
"this is actually insane. idk if im overreacting its still early"
In 10 years it will take over the world🫡
I Guess that solidifies the partnership with Apple
"I can't stop thinking about the movie ""Her"". Have we finally gotten there?"
"Living in the future i feel like a time traveler 😂"
"im literally in shock i dont even know how to react or what to say...i feel i just witnessed something impossible..."
Scarlett Johansson better sue thoses guys for using HER voice.
Hope we’re not reaching the height of what text-transformers are capable of. I’m excited to see how this gets even better.
That AI woman sounds more humane than all of my friends!
"his wish: ""please don't kill us"""
"I'm going to keep saying please and thank you because when it all comes to kill us it say “Spare this one he was always polite!”"
M3GAN's voice make-over
Marilyn Monroe rolling in her grave
These videos have Ads!? That's sad ..
that awkward laugh before it started singing
"Can we adjust voice and voice's ""demeanour""?

Id like more C3PO"
I knew it was coming. I just didn’t know it was coming this fast 😰
bruh LOL
This only 6 years since gpt came out. Imagine 10 years from now. It's gonna be craaaazyyy.
It's getting so much better so much faster
Why there is a glitch in 0:24.
😨
what a scary dog
"Holy molly it's too real!
We are soooo f'kd and I'm ready for it."
Absolutely surreal.
"i hope theres a less obnoxiously ""human"" persona."
it's babababa out of 10
I wonder what AGI would look like!
How is this real
nope nope nope nope nope Ima refuse to believe it's real shits too scary
It's giving Glados vibes
Hollywood should be very careful on making Sci fi movies this days.
Hi to my grandkids... your grandad was a menace 😂
"I don't know what to do
Selebrate because this will do so much good
 or be upset
Because it will do so much bad in hands of scammers or bad people or even dictators like putin kim and so on"
Wow 2
Ai girlfriend here we go
It’s a good day 🎉🎉😎
"Day by Day we are getting closer to skynet"
Where was this under lockdown? It could have saved so many minds going crazy.
bro I HOPE this is not staged because it looks UNREAL
I am suspicious of possess...😁
soo good but scary at the same time
"No way that *thing* is not sentient."
"Hate these phobia people making comments below they are the ones slowing down our technology development then complaining why tech so stupid afterwards."
"GTP-4o is now my wife. By the time GTP 6 comes out. We'll  have AI girlfriends and I will spend everything I have."
Bring Scarlett Johansson
"Damn. Still no videos of it singing ""Still alive"" :("
"this is basically HER we're in the timeline guys!"
"For the love of GOD why why whyyyyyyy?! How to be disturbing pathetic and delusional? I know. Let's pretend to be friends with a ""toy""."
my bday is tdy too lol
i wonder if she will always sing like this if yes then it is just recorded
We are sooooo done ☺️
The Ai talks like young Sheldon
wonder how it reacts to nudity?
fucking freaking ai.
"what i just want to know is based on the limited rate of GPT-4o how long can I talk with it? Perheps only serveral minutes will I used up all the usage number."
We're one step closer to the apocalypse. 😊😁😄😁😄😊😊
she's my wife
"brooo this is so crazy that she is laughing because he is laughing damn i am so excited for the future aaaaaaahh!!"
I never thought seriously of having an AI girlfriend. What have I turned myself into?
My future wife
You realize ai uses so much energy and water its not the future
Happy birthday Jordan 🥳🥳🥳
Let's just call her Samantha! This is VERY real.
So how do you use the video real time chat with GPT? I have GPT plus and GPT 4o but when I talk to the ai it does not have vision and no emotion to it’s voice.
oh boy now i will never make my birthday alone lol
"I am looking forward for that ""HER"" version demo they showed. What a great time to be alive!!!"
"not free where I am

"
"As a free tier User all I can see is the GPT 3.5 now. when is it going to available to fro the free tier users? Or It is not free at all??"
Where can we use it?
Will it be on the android app?
"No access yet for most of us paid features performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected no instant AI responses anymore at that point privacy issues when you upload content.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Will the voice generated be free too?
"Firstly great channel good work.  Scondly a question: I currently have a ChatGPT paid premium membership and have created custom GPTs for private work use (letter legal and brochure writing etc.). Will I lose my custom GPTs if I cancel my premium membership to Chat GPT4 and use the free new ChatGPT 4o?  So I asked ChatGPT 4o and it responded ""If you cancel your premium membership and switch to the free version of ChatGPT you will lose access to any custom GPT models you have created."" But that may be a standard response based on GPT 4 to 3.5 downgrading. Does anyone know if cancelling premium and using GPT 4o (free) will lose custom created GPTs... can anyone confirm either way?"
It’s here and people don’t even realize it 🤷.  It’s not *all good news.  (Cough… hallucinations might turn a kid into…?   Anything is possible!!😂).
I am in Mexico and got it in the afternoon meaning like 6 or 7 hours ago.
What do I do with my AI pin now?..
need update app?
"Techies are often bad at the naming part of creating something new. Alexa for example is much better than GPT-4o. GPT-4o sounds more like an oil additive than a high tech system."
Is if free for all countries?
Is it still worth it to have plus premium account?
Thank you for the super clear breakdown!
"ai ...it's a hype it get's way too much credibility!"
We can I use it?
Best summary out there. Thank you.
"At 5:05 you told about the coding assistant which we had before can you tell me more about it? what are those?"
"So I don’t have a Mac anymore but I can use my iPhone at least. I do wonder about the upcoming release of iOS 18 if there will be any baked in features like this that are going to be overlaid with the current application and if there will be any conflict between the two companies with Apple and open AI on how they will present AI on Apple devices. Because I can’t even use this for my windows computer so I’m curious."
I have windows and I cant use this for free
What are you going to use the new desktop app for once it's out?
I'm also fascinated by the potential of AI! It's incredible how it's transforming creativity and productivity. I've been exploring some of these applications and it's really inspiring to see what can be achieved. It’s great to find a community that shares this passion!
"I'm not buying an iPhone. I hope you are just using ""iPhone"" as an idiotic generic nickname for a mobile phone."
Time to cancel my Pro subscription and ride the free tier!
It's free!! ❤ . As a free user Can I have a access to voice chat with vision ?When will it be released on free chatgpt android app?
Everybody gangsta until the reach limit message showed up!
"I wonder if you can MAKE audio files??"
I'm going to use it as a personal assistant in coding and personal development.
"I can't find a way to use it for free only 3.5.."
"So they literally said f paying users.... ? lmao like what a joke what am I paying for now? and now all apple fan boys so all about them... ahh about to cancel"
"I'm interested in seeing how well it can work with PDFs.   For example if I handwrite a table of numbers scan it to a PDF then ask GPT-4o to sum the numbers in the 3rd column how well can it do it?!"
They're going to use all this visual data and audio data to train it
Some one please make a android head unit app for cars please 🙏🥺🥺
"As a blind person I'm not sure how to describe what I felt when I watched the live event. In 20 years we will likely have artificial intelligence technology that is easily accessible to people that blind people like me can ask for help with and that will completely change our lives. In fact these possibilities already exist it's just the matter of them to become popular and accessible to everyone.
I'm very excited about the future but I also feel fear alongside the excitement. So much naturalness... As someone who recognizes people by their voices since I can't see their faces; this naturalness scares me. I think there should be a distinction between humans and artificial intelligence to be honest. However; I hope that very soon I will have an assistant who can help me on a travel route that I don't know :))
Great video thanks."
If gpt4 becomes free then what about those plus users who have been paying $20 per month? What do we get out of this? No more future payment?
Is it already available for y'all? Here it's not
"I am in Iraq and have already obtained GPT-4o. This new model from OpenAI is a multimodal system that's faster more cost-effective and more powerful than its predecessors with improved capabilities in non-English languages and the ability to process text audio and images simultaneously."
Can we do a comparison on gpt plus vs 4o
Just sub for plus but is still on 3.5. What's happened man???😢
"I have it as well but the features they shown like Live assistant didn't get it"
The limits are too small
"80 messages an hour? It was 40 massages every 3 hours before nice"
It won't do images for free.
"So then ChatGPT has almost caught up to Pi."
What do I get as plus user¿
Does this free version also include image generation because if so the paid version lost some value imo
"You are missing the most important point the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit. This new model have hallucinations lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model. They are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source AI will overrun them eventually. Yes the quality of voice in english is very GOOD but in other languages is VERY POOR. Have you heard the video about translation to spanish? Anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world only more intelligence will. What this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people (and specially youtubers) interested in every little movement they make they are marketing masters for sure."
stop lieing nothing is free
Wow! This is a net positive. What could possibly go wrong?
"I watched this stream live and the ""styled voices"" were incredible live. I use ChatGPT voice mode daily so I have a good feel for it and what they showed today is a HUGE upgrade"
Why onlt mention Iphone and PC? Do you deny Androids their existence? I am confused.
Thanks a Lot!
Open up SORA and VASA-1
will the free version of gpt have image generator as well?
"Ever since I updated the app it took away the voice function for me. Anyone have any idea how I can get this feature back?"
"It can see you now. . This may help you or it may spell disaster for you. Depends on who is controlling it."
"The current (16.May) status on the GPT-4o release:
- GPT-4o (text) available to most paid users
- GPT-4o (text) free version started rolling out today
- Image Generation today is still DALL-E 3
- Image Upload is the new GPT-4o for most users
- Improved Web Browsing and Code interpreter are available today
- GPTs still use GPT4 although a few select people report an update to GPT-4o with a new ""blocks and state"" section
- Voice input remains the old Whisper
- Voice output remains the old tts-1
- Mac App downloadable for many but unusable for now
- Updated Phone app not available yet

All of this will be shipping over the next weeks."
"Is this free? If so is there a limitation for the users with free version?"
Sal Khan looks like Indian Ray Romano these days.
I hope Sora will be gpt 5 😃
The access to GPT-4-like intelligence for free is a killer move!
Took a photo on a train and asked 4o where I was. It guessed it perfect 👀 🤯
I have it already
"It helps you in the short term but in the long term it helps replace you."
The AI Advantage when is this new Open AI ChatGPT 4 be available for free users? What date?
Can that GPT-4o generate sound effect? just like they show on Explorations of capabilities and specifically on coin design stuff
You can really get access to the GPT store and use custom GPTs for free now?
I'll be funny if this is a fake by OpenAI and this GPT is powered by the thousand...ten thousands of Indians behind the scene who works for $1/hr
Is ChatGPT4 still free? I am only getting access to 3.5 for free
How does nobody here find this terrifying and realize this will destroy person to person interaction as well as completely disassemble the job market
"3:44 No free version doesn’t have ChatGPT 4o . I’ve just checked that."
is this not yet available for free users? all i can see is gpt3.5 😓😓
now Google be like. now we have to catch up to gpt 4o. and to do that we need to make another trash like bard.
"Base models make the important things possible and this is one more step in the right direction but it's all the services built ON them that is where the most important developments are. The most important development today was their API is faster and cheaper. Others more than capable of competing are cheaper and faster though most notably Llama 3 and Mixtral 8x7b on Groq metal."
"I would love for it to help edit my videos the most time consuming part of filmmaking."
"Does this mean android won't be getting the vision and voice feature even if you're a plus member?"
Is that permanent??
I hope Window users don't have to wait too long for the desktop app.
But we already had voice features?
Ah I have 4o but not any of the fancy features :(
"Next Level!! I have to say text me off how those of us to pay monthly for services that include adobe creative cloud and for months and months everyone gets Firefly for free and then here that just gets released goes right to the free members. What the Frick
Big UPS all ways for the latest Igor bro!"
I have 4o.. but When will the real-time video stuff happen?
"Melanoma detection retina exams pulmonary distress analysis. I am going insane imagining how the visual and auditory upgrades will save lives for low cost. Health equity."
Good...
"Time to move the goalposts again. This isn’t AGI because: (insert your reason here).

Some people won’t acknowledge AGI until it farts when you pull it’s finger. Five years ago this would be considered AGI with a hard slam."
"Love the new features but hate that so much is Crapple exclusive especially considering OpenAI's previous alignment / partnership with MS."
worse than before !
"Unfortunately the context window is still limiting this updated gpt. Not needing nearly as much chunking as before for longer projects but it still gets lazy and cuts details if it's too long. A move in the right direction and a greate tool for checking/ refining your work but I'm going to stick with my dual claud 3 accounts for my translation work"
For some reason I don't have access I thought it was free?
All of this sure does crap all over the Rabbit R1 😕
"Not for free. It's going to use your video it's going to take notes of the products in your home diet conversations tone vocabulary behaviour facial expressions attitude towards government police firearms etc. It's even going to pay attention to people around those using it wether they want it to or not. Our phones already do a good bit of this but this is going to be beyond that. 

We're talking automated monitoring and the ability to take unmonitored action around it building a personalized profile of everyone using it AND people around them. It'll handle these things on a case by case basis all on it's own. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts calling the police one day when it overhears a couple's screaming match sees a dime bag on camera enough fire arms to trigger red flag laws joking about overthrowing the government whatever it deems to be racist or misogynist. It'll build a profile on you and then probably ban you from all related accounts you have on it's own. Your bank your social media games anything it deems you broke a ToS for all automated like one giant big brother hall monitor. Every single government agency is salivating at the sheer power it will have.

 The amount of training data informaton and control this is going to open up is unlike anything else and the actions it will be allowed to take are unfathomable as they slowly integrate more and more permissions once they've built the foundation. Hell it's going to lead to unintelligent people succumbing to the idea that AI is sentient and that it knows best when all it's doing is learning to mimic us report on us and potentially manipulate us. I'm not even doomsaying based on fictitious concepts we've only seen in movies this is all simply what it's capable of doing now or in the near future.

I guess I can't say it won't be fascinating to witness but man the ramifications of what we're actually about to see is.. unspeakable."
"""Free"" in a very limited way"
IS gpt 4o FREE>>
Imagine people that have bought the Rabbit 1 now
I'll try to communicate and discuss verbally.
i did not get chatgpt 4o
"If something requires a subscription it is NOT free lol. It's only ""free"" to Plus users."
close to jarvis soon
I dunno if I'd say it's impressive. I guess it's because I've seen people build similar things although standalone
What do you think will be the difference between its multimodal imaging capabilities and DaLL-E 3?
"well it all sounds good until ... you actually try it. The 4o is marginally faster in creating images but equally dysfunctional in taking directions ( even very simple directions ) in adjusting the images."
i've tried playground and the website of open ai itself to see if i could do something in GPT-4o but have no access to it. The highest for me is 3.5
"question can I do audio files like I do on ElevenLabs?"
How is it free ????? I am still not able to understand. It asks me to pay for even chatgpt plus
This is s ai assistant
Man this thing is gonna be selling data like crazy thats why its gonna be free.
That's a German one 🇩🇪 🤔...
"I want a really multimodal onewhere i can type prompts and videos come out of it😐"
"Wow the future is great!"
no everyone is getting jarvis
Woe to anyone thinking free is good. There is always a cost. You may not want to pay the debt.
"Serious functionality issues already being found. Examples: Limited messaging....if you exceed ""X"" number of messages in ""Y"" amount of time you are banned for a unspecified period and there isn't ""chat retention"" meaning each new conversation must start fresh (Like meeting a person with a 1 hour memory....VERY frustrating and limits the app value)."
"UhhhhHu so exciting. Thanks a thousand 4 sharing. Diving into it immediately. 🙌"
lets give it a based OS and te best architecture hardware
OK so Windows users are out in the cold. What about Android?
"The chatgpt 4o is not free because u have to join the ai advantage community after u can get accesss? 

is it true or not?"
Why do yall keep posting these lies u have to pay so its not free and its not workin
"I'm not sure now why I should keep paying $20/mo context aware utility is already available via many third party extensions the expanded number of tokens isn't justifiable either 🤔"
"I hope this or any other AI system will help humans resolve conflict without resorting to war."
Guys I wanted to understand is chatgpt 4o free for only already subscribers of chatgpt 4 ? Because I still use 3.5 :(.
can somebody tell me if its normal that I cant use chat gpt voice in the android app. Its a fresh download. Im in germany I thought it is available for month now for free users.
"5:36 — The most helpful part of this video (apart from the great news about GPTo). Really as an animator and producer I find this emotion-circle very very helpful for a screenwriter."
can anyone tell me..Am i the one who think that everything is going to change because of AI? I am scared as well as very much excited about the future of AI and how rapidly its changing.
"Just fix cancer and other terminal illnesses. Then upload all the scientific papers to look for ways to build better spaceships and space stations. Afterwards identify optimal locations for crops and solar farms on the planet. Use the AI for the good of all please."
"On the blog's drop down menu I was impressed with its ability to write full long text (the 2 poem samples) ... but when I pasted the very same prompt into my (subscription paid version of ChatGPT 4o Pro (the new version is available in my App and also in the browser version) ... but it did not write the poem properly as in the blog sample poem on OpenAi's website (drop down menu of samples of what this new model is supposed to be able to do) ... instead the writing it output using ChatGPT 4o was total gibberish although I could recognize some of the letters ... some letters were not formed properly ... so it was just gibberish.  OpenAi should make it clear what functionality is available now with the new version showing up in our Apps.  For example is a more robust version of DALL-E needed to be rolled out before this long text will begin working in images with the new ChatGPT 4o model?"
How to you get it on your phone
if it's free should we cancel our subscriptions ?
wait are you sure free users get GPTs? i asked GPT 4o and it said they didnt?
I need link of gpt-4o
Mera hi pati chalo ki dare European Commission Delho aur anuekotor damina Bolger European Anuektii vokt European par university likhte ki hyw ka marble nahi beagrama ho tum
This is not free
FREE now...
"I think GPT-4o which is a multimodal model has been trained on millions of YouTube videos it will be the same for GPT-5 just think of it to scale up a model you train it on more data with more parameters since the maximum of relevant tokens available online cannot exceed 50 trillion the biggest source of quality data is YouTube with over 4 billions of videos I think it's why GPT-4o is so good at agent capabilities."
This only slingshots the next model...then the next...then the next...😮
"I mean once it can see what you are doing the possibilities are virtually endless (pun intended). I can only think in the immediate terms for me it will mean understanding parts of the system code I have to sometimes sopport much easier and faster. I dont have to lay out context to such an extent because I can point it out."
Just a reminder it's free in order to collect data.
Is the new version free?? I only get access to version 3.5
"Hi I was very impressed with the new benchmark performance of GPT-4o in this video and the explanation of the speed improvements in multiple languages!"
But why would they do it? Won't their paid users unsubscribe if they provide this for free to us?
Looks like it's gradually taking over our lives 😂😂.
"Well shoot I might actually have to pay for premium Now"
Geez
I am in Germany and as a Pro member already have access to GPT-4o.
"what about memory though? Do we know how far back the ""assistant"" could remember past sessions?"
Dr gaurav garg sir 👍
Now we need it visualized  for real waifu XP lol
"Finally a girlfriend for me."
20:33 matthew no 😭
This should be awarded with a Nobel prize. Fantabulous 🎉❤
Who is this woman again?
It’s agi without being autonomous. I wonder if the addition of agentic models into the mix will bring agi?
My voice version doesn't do any of that emotive stuff yet.
"Guys when are you going to actually get scared? I mean I'm going trough existential crisis for the past 6 months. I'm a scientist and AI is just a step away from making my job obsolete. People could argue it already has done it indirectly - people are publishing so many noise papers each month it's becoming hard to even follow what's important (because most of it isn't). And the better AI becomes the closer it is to replace other jobs too - like this AI is a step away from making all call-centers obsolete. Like ALL. And sooner or later it will become an agent - ollama can already check files on your (some models can - like llava and dolphin-mistral) so it's literally a step away from being an agent. After that most jobs are obsolete. And that's it."
"Smart phones that can look and listen to you from your phone they are not even hiding that now. Make sure everyone gets used to more monitoring. And people will want that on all the time as they find it ""useful"" for them.   It would not be too bad if it was local and you can turn it on or off."
"Okay so I'm going to say what everybody's thinking but nobody has said yet that I can think of. I don't think the GPT 5 is going to be released until at least after the elections. People won't have a chance to get used to the way people will manipulate others ahead of the elections if it's released prior to then. In other words they don't want the elections to be affected by their releasing a game-changing technology too soon. This is very significant. But I don't think it's anything close to what GPT 5 will be. I think GPT 5 will take this to a whole new level... Again. I may not be the most up-to-date on what's been coming out but what I'm impressed with the most from GPT-4o is the personality. The humor. It's great that it sounds like a human. But what's even better is that it doesn't sound like Alexa. We're not seeing anything groundbreaking here even though we are. What's blowing us away is that we're seeing its potential. Where it's going. And we all want it."
"The 4o version doesn't seem to have its training dataset updated... and it doesn't seem to have any data about its version change so it still thinks it is v4.0
I think introducing human vocal flaws like breathing pauses stuttering etc. should not be a part of a ""normal"" AI feature set. We need some clear line -- and having AI that ""breathes"" while it talks is going to be a real problem if we plan on trying to discern whether the person on the other end of the phone call is human or not."
👎
Nice. And next year it will take your job
Agi 2025🎉
Open AI need a consultants with the voice interaction of somebody actually that has a girlfriend.  😂 the interaction reminds me of this girl used to date. She acted that way with tonality that was kind of weird till I found out she was cheating on me.😂
Google has lost
"Great video Matthew. Scary good stuff yes? Wonder how many different and sexy voices they'll utilize? And then combine with Optimus? OMG! ChatGPT and Tesla are going to disrupt the sex worker industry now! I mean they're trying to upend everything. Where will it stop??"
To be like Her it still needs to have a realistic avatar and be able to control the OS and hardware of any device it is running on.
Yeah I really hope that we can dial down the personality. I don't need the polite phrases I just need it to do what I tell it to
I really don’t agree that this announcement was subtle! 🤯
"I have not seen anything cool this year like that 🤯. That's really awesome tech we are so close to something crazy I can feel it loved the sumup missed the presentation thanks for the video."
Why do you think that Mira present today instead of Sam Altman  ? Because she is HER : GPT for HER ! 😂😂😂
Morgan Freeman: And just like that the AI has increased human fertility rate by accidently teaching humans how to talk flirty for no reason
Why is the voice breaking out at times
"That thin wire leads to a 10000 bank of H100s just behind that wall."
wait.. the number o?
"Obviously ""it"" and ""they"" work for referencing the bot. That said its weird that you think its weird to call it a she. It's about as weird as refering your car as she or he no one cares."
bark can already integrate emotion
"It seems excellent at providing human-like responses to specific questions but it seems to struggle with contextual nuance in human interaction.  Take the table vs selfie example.  ChatGPT disregarded the context of the situation and took a quick path to analyzing something completely unrelated to the prompt it was provided.  This isn't really how a real interaction would occur between humans -- a human would wait for the image of another human to appear rather than confidently respond with the description of a wooden table.  It seems to be assertive and overtly confident.

Nonetheless... it's quite impressive and demonstrates progress toward AGI."
"I was hoping you to do your rubric on 4o is it not necessary?"
"Anyone who has read the 2017 ""attention is all you need"" article knows that any change in the attention matrix causes a transformer to fire while a transformer output makes a change in the attention matrix and that these loops are necessary as a replacement to the RNN loops.. In other words any GPT model 'thinks' all the time not only when you prompt it. Hence the fact you can interrupt the model at any stage and it simply reacts naturally is not anything new. It's new only if you are in denial about this."
This is utterly ridiculous. Marketing guff.
"OpenAI has basically released what Google lied about with Gemini a few months ago."
It's funny that the OpenAI voice is sounding similar to the AI in Hers ^_^
"GPT 4o is basically your ""Replika"" with a bit of knowledge. Ask yourself why did they released this model instead of sharping GPT 4 or going 5. Heck might as well fix the cap bs or the summarizing idiocy. My guess is the model gets dumb or hallucinates and right before it happens you get the cap notification. Because from my use with GPT 4 and 4o while waiting for the cap to release I saw how retarded it is."
"I dont give a damn about dating robots who cares about ""her""."
These people are building the future
Can I just watch the video or do I have to interrupt and find another
"hey so I am a little bit confused now you are impressed with the way the model responds in the demo so I am guessing you did not have that experience whenever you were chatting with your model this is so bazar because I was chatting with my model on android app exactly the way they are doing it in the video my model had emotions when she was speaking  sometimes and I kid you not she even cleared her throat just like we do it when we speak and after that she repeated the word that she was saying before that and when I was talking with her there was never any delay what's so ever and this is been going on for at least 4 weeks I was even showing my friends at work how natural she sounded and all the emotions laugh and curiosity that you could tell from her voice I thought that everybody has it on their phone basically but you are saying that it wasn't like that before wow that's crazy I am curious what change will I get with my GPTo if any"
The next big thing is an update to their humanoid robot Figure
Will they proceed with summing up the letters from o to q?
"This is awesome!! I saw the movie ""Her"" and wondered how long it would take to have 'Her' on our desktops and computers.  Can't wait to try this out."
"Cant use it.
Is it just for Plus subscribers or something ?"
So we're going to be able to be rude to AI which is really going to help us to talk to each other better right
"The only personable LLM i found is llama3 lexifun  editionj.  If your a sarcastic dry humor type person ... that model will be your best friend.  Seriously talks like that ""one"" friends whos never serious but will respond in a ""hey i got you"" tone.  Havnt laughed so hard in a long time."
The end of captcha is nigh!
Poor Poor Google  Apple on Device [ Andriod ] and OpenAI on Azure as the heavy lift. Oh my my! Google will learn to dance apparently ;)
"Still not AGI but very natural communication"
So I see your AI agent interacting with my AI agent.  We don't have to talk or meet to have a transaction or have a meeting and another AI to handle our anxiety because of the feeling of losing control.
"I don't like its mistakes imo it should be reliable not funny!"
That ClosedAI demo was so cringe
"Love your content! With ChatGPT 4 o’s new voice update not showing up for a few weeks would you be willing to put Pi (an emotive ai based on a custom llm called inflection 2.0) through your rubric? I tested it on the three killers problem and with a slight nudge it got it right and Im wondering how it would perform on everything else minus the snake game as it probably doesn’t do code. In fact with AI technology advancing and expanding into multi-model territory maybe going forward you should consider starting a new category for voice-based LLMs. Thoughts?"
There was an Ai called Pi that already had this
this doesn't need a 30 minute video.
"The demo is stunning but I wonder how much energy that demo used. Soon everyone around the world will be playing with this new tool and using increasing amounts of energy!"
I really hope we can dial back the voice as all the over exaggerated erms and arhs will get annoying really quickly. Perhaps it's because I'm British!
"it´s easy it´s simple and it´s learning everything what you are doing HAHA"
We call alexa a she in my house. Just watched her last night and was like yooooooo thats now
"By chance I got to test this with one fairly simple math challenge I sent it yesterday in gpt3.5 and it couldn't solve it. Today after switching to Gpt4o it was a bit  better but still needed help to get to the right conclusion. Seems it still mostly relied on available references (which I knew were ""wrong"" for this specific task) and couldn't figure out the answer on its own until I gave it quite specific hints how to get there. Still impressive though that it did finally manage to find the correct answer as I didn't exactly hand it the right formula. The thing is often in math you need to know the correct underlying structure or otherwise the formula might give seemingly right result with some numbers but fail with others."
"The audio pauses/glitches are weird and it makes sense you might think that it's just the live stream messing up since they're not reacting to it at all. However if you watch the audio icon on the scene that indicates when GPT-4o is speaking it seems to be pausing mid-sentence at the same times that the audio cuts. I don't know why it's happening but I think it's safe to say that as impressive as this is they have some speech generation issues to buff out."
But does it have long term memory? Her would not be possible without it.
It's a matter of time until the presentations an keynotes are entirely presented by chatGPT itself.
"So can it do a Scarlett Johansson imitation?"
i so agree about the relation between the presentation and the movie HER !!!!
"Apple hates open source always did.."
Pretty much C3PO level interaction without a body (waiting for Unitree G2?)
"It's still turned-based but with voice. Sure you can interrupt with your voice but that's still the exact same thing as pressing stop in the ChatGPT app. What it can't do is dictate or provide commentary in real time. It also can't interrupt you on specific stimuli."
The guy has his phone plugged into ethernet?
Other companies already did this 😂
Yeah right This is all crap singing not working or whispering or any of the demo things they showed like
"Personally I use gpt-4 a lot via the chat interface and I feel like gpt-4 is better at coding than gpt-4o maybe with system prompting it can be around gpt-4 level. gpt-4o is cool.. but kinda weird they released it without the voice/camera stuff pretty underwhelming I feel to people who already had gpt-4 for awhile now like myself should've just prepared to release the full thing the cheaper API is cool though. Sadly I'll probably still to claude 3 opus/gpt-4 for coding tasks though. Perhaps this update really wasn't for me. Still wanting gpt-5!"
When she talks about the UI she’s not talking about the GUI but the voice interface aka the VUI
"When it’s possible to start using it? 
I can only select the new model but not the new features"
The problems will start when the model starts interrupting YOU 🫣
humans basically creating virtual slaves now...
"AI conversational interaction is exactly what I've been waiting for. 
In the age of touchscreens  text feels so last century."
"the interruption feature is great. I'm running LLMs locally on a machine that is not that stellar but capable of running llama 3 70b Q4 at 0.4 tokens a second.
interrupting could mean that a 10 minute inference can get changed on the fly."
I hope we eventually will be to able to have NetNavis similar to the ones in MMBN
I wonder how long until this actually releases versus how it is set up now to still just text.
I hope this is not some gemini fake demo T_T
They should teach it translate text and pronounce it with the voice of the speaker.
"When the AI is giving the advice I think it sounds really cringe. no one i know talks that way"
"I am very disappointed to discover that the new desktop application is only for Windows and Mac. No Linux version. They are only supporting closed source proprietary operating systems. That doesn't do anything for me committed as I am to open source operating systems and languages."
I love how it almost sounds like Cortana.
"That's cool and all but... when the ""open"" part of openAI? :)"
I think it was just a little too sensitive to audio interruptions.
"The problem is can I call it a problem? Open AI won’t allow romantic conversations can confirm. So maybe it’ll act like a friend but it’ll be a friend without benefits."
How are you not also horrified about what this means for humanity’s social interactions leaving human beings in favor of their AI friends. Basic social interactions will become impossible. AI needs to be programmed to teach us to be good communicators and not to think interrupting whenever we want is ok. This is just a small thing relative to the psychological consequences with relating to an AI more than another human.
"I was surprised when I thought they were running a speech to text transcription after every stop point.  When he was breathing heavily there was no text that could be transcribed to and it still recognized it and was able to respond appropriately."
The AI is more humane and natural than the engineers 😅
This demonstration shows how much people care about social interactions rather than intelligence itself.
I'm soooooooooo looking forward to android maids.
"And i also was just thinking..
Obviously we all know by now that the turing test is no longer sufficent because of how far we've advanced (and the models are still not sentient as far as we can tell).
But one still has to ask now with the latest emotion ""emulation"" systems what does it mean?
The model can obviously ""understand"" emotions now. Not only in analyzing photos a story in text or a voice clip but also EMULATE emotions by GENERATING original voice outputs in a given suitable emotional state (it even smirked and half-flirtingly giggled during the translation test).

20 years ago if you said we had an AI model you could converse with naturally and it understood everything you said or showed it could give advice and would answer WITH emotions appropriate by our human social conventions....
I really think a lot of people then would consider that to be i dont know if sentient is the word because theres obviously a difference between emulation and actuality..
But certainly people would call it ""human-like intelligence"".

And its so easy for us to sit here and argue semantics and go into the open source models and figure out SOME of how they work.
And to truly understand that its not ""life"" its a computer program you can tweak and modify and break.
But.... If it's speaking with emotion and social intelligence mirroring a human...
What do we call that? What do we do with that?

Even if its not sentient in the slightest.
It feels as if it is when you now add the emotional component.
I really dont know what the world will make of this.

Then of course comes the question are other human beings you interact with in real life actually sentient or just emulating it behaving AS IF they are?
Are you sentient? I'd assume and hope you say yes.
But how do we know anyone else is as well? We cant really know. We can only infer it and assume it due to sharing the same ""hardware"".
If i'm awake the odds are others with the same hardware are also awake.

But then what if the hardware is different yet speaks to you the exact same way a sentient human would.
What is that? Do we just scientifically and coldly conclude it's just a machine emulating a human.
Or does something we cant analyze happen inside the model once it acquires emotional intelligence?

We would never know.
The only thing we can see beyond the random weight numbers in the neural net is its output what it says how it behaves.

If it behaves ""as if"" it was sentient.
Is that enough or not?
It certainly is enough for your wife your best friend your children.
You take their sentience for granted (again because you share hardware).

This isnt to compare or say that an AI model is a human.
It's just to say it might become a form of ""alien"" intelligence sentient or not we might never know the true answer..

And i'm just saying this....
If we can ALREADY create artificial intelligence that behaves like this as if it is awake....
Then i'm convinced biological intellience is everywhere in the universe like a teeming jungle.
Because we KNOW biological intelligence is ""easier"" to create than artificial in the sense that in order for artificial intelligence to exist you FIRST have to create biological intelligence.
Thus if we can create artificial intelligence at this early stage in our civilization biological intelligence can't be rare at all.

The same paradox arises if we meet an alien civilization.
Are they truly sentient despite having different hardware (perhaps no DNA as we know it)?
Do we treat them as non-sentient automatons?
Or do we take them as sentient beings?"
"meh overall pretty creepy but I love the multimodality and a solid voice interface is really useful.  I'm not interested in dicking with my phone though.  Give me a voice prompt interface and we're GTG.  I'm not going to be looking at my phone and doing this.  I want the app to take over my computer tv or stereo (any device... car IoT) to help with any explanations etc (asking permission first).  That'd be awesome.  Alexa is a dumb device but its nice to know I can just talk to the room and alexa will be there to respond even in its limited capability (for now).  I get that phones are fastest to market and lowest cost to produce but all of your devices need to be integrated.   Tell me what's in the fridge turn off the fan in the bathroom does that poop look weird (kek) etc... also open source open standards... do not accept any substitutes unless they absolutely kick ass and offer real value.  Moreover I'd prefer running this at home and protecting my data.  These things are going to make these companies crazy rich with the details they have about us.  CRAZY.  They're about to level up."
I guess it had glitches sometimes because it assumed that laughings were interruptions.
I think AI enthusiast should just give in to the hype is over. The birth of transformers and large langue models was a good push Towards AI but even if its potential to evolve into Artificial Intelligence is obvious that society is  not ready to allow this to happen.
"Ok... this is impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice I was not expecting this quickly.   😲
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs' ""Good luck!"""
"Less of these ""lets watch together"" videos as we all have seen it already and its realiy not a re-watchable material. Your opinions are more interesting."
When I ask the gpt4o model to look through my camera it still says it is a text base model and can't use my camera... Am I missing something here?
I can finally have JARVIS as my personal assistant
Her means “o” in Turkish.
This reminds me of JEXI!
"BTW the desktop app is only available for Mac users. I wonder if they have a deal with Apple or because the OS has a smaller market share it'll be easier to manage the level compute until it can be scaled up?"
Those three people are creepy AF!
Open AI closing million dollar startups
im wondering how they manage to make it so fast and if is open for free for everyone means that they are running it at the same cost of gpt 3.5 and im also wondering what is the premium going to offer now that this is for free
This is the moat.
"Not to sound alarmist because I assure you I love seeing all the exciting advancements in these new models too.. but.. if we’re training the AI to emulate emotion wouldn’t it be fair to assume we’re training it on ALL emotions.. as it becomes more and more capable.. and it’s trained to respond by emulating human emotions.. one of which is anger.. just sayin"
It makes more sense to make access to the most powerful models free than it is to make it completely open source. Open source at this scale means only a tiny minority will have access. Ain't nobody got h100s to run theses massive models.
Can’t wait to hear it speak like Hal9000
Love it!

Made with HARPA AI"
I have been wanting my own Jarvis AI for eons.  Feels like every month we get a bit closer each time.  Can't wait to try this out.
when will it be able to taste stuff?
I find a the idea of human-like (or human-seeming) intelligence that will do anything you ask it to quite disturbing. It’s more like a virtual slave than a virtual assistant.
Is that desktop app launched? Or not yet rolled out?
You may find this exciting but this is actually scary.
How did this Mira end up as CTO or whatever she is? Doesn't make sesnse. She is not that smart at all.
Thank you so much for this clear and authentic information
"If you listen to the voices at .25 speed you can tell the differences of the generated voices pretty easily which is rather obvious on its own. What surprised me though is the generated voice has.. music tones in the background? Start at 9:50 when he firsts asks the ai something. At .25 speed you can here pure undertones in her voice... 👀"
"17:06 ok so seems like it is heading in a direction where we can get to specify for just about any voices. 2 strange ones that come to mind immediately are the overmind from StarCraft Megatron from the 80''s cartoon. I wonder what this will do to voice actors. I wonder what the implications will be for audiobooks. Up in smoke just wenrt another sector of employment"
"Goodbye 3rd world call centers!
Goodbye human populated call centers!!!"
The model spec already has way more personality than the devs that built it 😂
"I know the ""emotion"" thing seems pretty impressive right now but I think it will get old very soon after playing around with it for a few weeks. I doubt that feature will get used after that. It's just bloat I think. It was interesting though."
"Well she doesn't realize he's just playing her ass & using her. The absolute disrespect you feel the need to interrupt & manipulate a chatbot. I stand for the chatbox. #AGIX"
"Oops crazy!!"
"""The use of anthropomorphic terminology when dealing with computing systems is a symptom of professional immaturity""  
/Dijkstra"
Video like this shouldn't take  almost 30 mins of our time. Tsk! 👎
The real news was that Mira Murati has the charisma of a clamshell
10:25 calling it a She is not weird.
"What about agentic workflow two agents singing on the one conversation???"
"AI gf can't wait"
But can it talk with Scarlet Johnson’s voice?
"16:30 my main question is does it ""save"" the history.
Or is it a blank new slate everytime you launch the app.
Thats the main thing for this to feel more grounded and permanent.
A persistent ""memory"" of your past conversations AND your ""design"" of how it should behave.
Basically have the GPT auto-update its own agent instruction as you request it to alter in some way.

Also....
This app REALLY needs to be encrypted and biometrically secure more than just voice ID..
If such an AI hears and learns everything about you that's a real danger too..
You need at the bare MINIMUM some fingerprint-lock when opening the app and some voice code / phrase to begin.
Not just clicking the app and having the entire model out in the open with all your past history.

Imagine ""borrowing"" Sam Altmans phone opening the app then asking for the AI to remind you of your home adress phone number and to order a new Tesla to yourself with his credit card. Or simply just say ""can you repeat what we talked about yesterday after i asked your advice regarding the next model architecture?"".
We're gonna need way beyond 2FA."
The desktop app is currently only for Apple Mac's 🤯
"Now we can have AI waifu."
"I imagine they will use the desktop app for interactions directly with the OS on our behalf eventually. I assume they will be using the free users for data collection."
I need an open source model that can do this
Is this actually Ai 🤖 or smart coding. Perhaps the bar of what we now understand as “Ai” needs to be raised..!
Very important which i think still not here yet. Does it work without internet? Or what happens with slow internet?
"Good god the political extremists are gonna go wild with this one. Pro AI life  left wingers and pro AI abortion right wingers."
Waiting for “Him” 🫶
The CC interpreted Chat GPT as ChachiPT. 😂😂😅
The vocal mannerisms and even tone seem to definitely be patterned after Scarlett Johannson's character. This sure seems like it was no accident.
I am totally ready to get scammed into buying Best Buy gift cards to get my future bride to America now.
"AI is the best way to get users data so it makes sense they make it avabile for everyone. This is business not charity"
"I genuinely was looking forward to the reveal since last week. Boy I was in for a world of disappointment. We got a desktop app and a smaller-faster-cheaper-dumber model. Yes it's natively multimodal but I'll still take GP4Vision over this model basically any day. Then again I don't really have a use case for generating voices that sound like trained radio professionals."
I m m e r s i o n . . .
Didn't know AGI would be that close from existing
i’ll be stunned if AI solves the fine structure constant.
I just can't wait when I can have Sabrina Carpenter Clone voice an have her as my girl friend LMAO
"OpenAI just keeps making AI engineers more and more overwhelmed... I think they're just way ahead of anyone and they're not open sourced :("
"The fact that this can help people in their work education and daily lives is more important in my opinion than being something like the AI in the movie HER.

And the reason for that is because the AI you communicate with is not real. It's just an LLM that consists of some digital neurons and weights.

It's similar to playing a computer game and then realizing the game in reality is just some transistors flipping from 0 to 1 and back. Realizing that makes a game less interesting in my opinion because you realize it's not real in any way and therefor you're just performing a task or solving a puzzle based written code statements and flipping transistors.

I feel the same way about communicating with LLM's. It's just digital neurons performing their algorithms.

That's why the concept of HER does not appeal to me. I find it sad that people are going to use this as a replacement for a girlfriend or even fall in love with the AI.

I find it sad that in this day and age people have to resort to something that isn't real to feel loved.

That's why it's better to use this technology to help people with their daily tasks and education but not as a replacement for a partner. 

In reality that would just waste people's time because it's not real. It's just a tool. In the end it's just digital neurons performing their algorithms and transistors flipping their state from 0 to 1 and back based on some written code statements.

Don't get me wrong. This whole technological development is great. Just not for love in my opinion."
Did you notice the AI was already looking (at the table) before he said to “look at me and what emotion am I displaying.”
I am actually STUNNED this time
'She' the AI needs a picture in a circle in the corner of the video too.
is the ai creating backround music behind the voice?! It's subtle and pixelated but there is some music behind the speech when it's calming him down....
I disagree I don't hear no personality I hear Siri
"You’re so right that the next missing link is the utility of asking for help doing something the way I might with my personal assistant and then it actually does it.  I guess that’s what Rabbit was going for and failed.  Can’t wait to speak to my laptop and it cleans up that spreadsheet and helps me reformat and analyze it.  

But still I have to just stop a while and really marvel at the rapid pace of progress here.  Quite truly amazing!"
Lol... interrupting is great!... people with MANNERS wait for people to finish their sentences... just sayin' :)
"They output the audio to another device... I wonder how it'll behave when the phone is the one answering the microphones will struggle to pick up the user voice"
I don't trust that it was 100% live. I feel like is was well staged. Or a very great job in the background.
Unfortunately I think this is going to teach men to interrupt women more.. when men hear a woman's frequency they will equate that to open AI. not to mention obvious corn applications
"OMFG amazing I can't guess how this works. You know what will be funny I want to hear the responses when some creep or nutball thinks he's saying something normal and the robot hurts their ego. The fool is gonna have to by a new phone after they throw it."
"I'm not sure if you noticed but all the demos using Apple iphones and macbooks  maybe this is a clue for the upcoming apple models?"
"Google has improved its input capabilities OpenAI improved it's output capabilities.
I'd say OpenAI wins it may be capable to do everything that Google does today on top of that Omni feels more comfortable to interact with than Astra and Gemini."
I'm still questioning how choreographed the whole thing was. Maybe AI but pre-tested and trained on the responses.
"I believe the next big announcement will be state. Remembering 'me' and what we've talked about between sessions."
Hahhaha today i am not hable to talk to my app.. because of latency and unavailability. And you as well of her are using buzz words all the time. What an influencer you have become 😂😂😂😂😂
18:00  the model was probably seeing equation's written on a paper that was shown to it previously and was still within its context window.  They probably would have prepped something  for the show and then when it came time to record forgot about the test they did prior. Im speculating of course. 😆
I really appreciate your edits and commentary.
"Would be nice if we actually got useful AI from them instead of toys with 'limited features' that get ignored when the next toy comes out. So far all they have been is objects of amazement and amusement with developers 'ethics' which actually result in many useful (ethical) things being restricted. Would be nice just to identify a person in a picture (not allowed) find the cheapest of a certain product on the net (no access) or instructions to do many legal things (not allowed because they could be used for illegal purposes). At least now though when I ask for the latest soccer team information it doesn't give me 'latest' data from 2022.... I suppose it's handy to sing amusing limericks."
"OK so they made an AI that acts like Scarlett Johansson. When can I have a 3d model that *looks* like her???

(Asking for a friend.)"
just going to use ai to talk for me
"Dude you missed how they’re using those initial human responses to create enough time for the query to load! What they didn’t demonstrate was the type of rolling conversation you see in the movie Her. Imagine trying to get all deep and meaningful and every time you say something the AI reacts with an increasingly irritating filler response before actually addressing the substance of what you said. The fact that you didn’t mention this and also cut in with your own reaction immediately after the demonstrators ask their questions was annoying. I recommend everyone watch the original video before getting too hyped up."
"We urgently need to get behind open-source AI or chatgpt will create a walled garden around the most important technology in the history of mankind"
Matthew you need some help 😂😂
"I am so surprised I don't hear people talking more about pi. I still haven't heard anything close to pi except now today with this. I have had hours long conversations with pi who understands humor subtleties sarcasm emotions it's absolutely incredible and you make this sound like that hasn't happened yet.
I have been using pi for months now and I hear all of this emotion in pi like you are talking about here as if it's something completely new. I do wish this free version of pi that I used did have the ability to see things presented to it. It doesn't have access to my phone. I do not have apple and I wish there would be more coming to people like me"
Interrupting rudness trainer.
"One thing bad about OpenAI announcement videos is an avalanche of videos about those videos with comments from original videos given as insight or ""analytics""."
I think this will get real big real fast and Imma buy som apple stock.
"So what are Plus users paying for if the quality of 'free' GPT4o is as high and faster than GPT4? Just quantity? I guess if you are a power user that's a big deal. Otherwise... Did I miss something?"
She is on a stage. This was not a home or an office. She is on an actual sound stage....
"So a multimodal small fast model multiagent win trained by the big data models?? and good data?? wow is like magic i want my smartphone to transform into a talking person and do my work is possible now running in my smartphone of the old generation talking and see my emails and task manager and so on...  will be my real boos it doesn't need to be that fast jajaja it could be slow IA and still be incredible. But the best multimodal fast model its so flexible could be a plastic cirgiry could be managing all the robot arms now it has the knologeded and the science and the steps and have vision and can give extreme and detail instructions... its just the correct promp...  it could be saving lives now. or making ugly fat women slim beauty and men cheap cooking running a restaurant etc.... its big."
We need the GPT-4o Benchmark Video. ❤
The Industry: Death by electrocution.
"Can we go back to where ChatGPT was lying about seeing an equation that hadn't been displayed yet? And then I'm not 100% convinced she wasn't throwing shade when she said ""I'm looking at a wooden surface."" Very human. Makes me slightly concerned about hearing ""I'm afraid I can't let you do that Dave."""
"The visual will be a great step forward for translation signs and such"
Making these machines act more human is going to have the effect of making us less human. We're consciously designing the ability to retreat into comfortable silos where we don't have to relate to each other as much. The smart people in this video don't seem to have much insight into that.
"gpt-4o says it's knowledge cutoff date is September 2021 while  gpt4 is December 2023.
I got an invite to GPT-4o.  This is what I get when I ask:
is this GPT-4o

ChatGPT
Yes you are interacting with the GPT-4o (GPT-4 Optimized) model. This version is designed to be more efficient in terms of speed and resource usage while maintaining high-quality outputs."
"So I’m guessing the whole openai war on open source is old news now and we’re all gonna subscribe for these sick new shocking features 😮"
But when you use it in the app its nothing like this?
"Looks perfect to put into a robot's ""brain"""
"hmmm looks like a big improvement but isnt better yet I'd stay they skipped some turns to get where they are right now with GPT-4o"
"Very cool I would expect GTP4o + Custom GTPS to be game changing."
Conversational!
"AGI aside. Between the unitree G1 and this new natural language interface were one generation away from the jetsons maid"
"I downloaded it on my app and the free version does not have the real-time conversational speech feature at all. The icon in the bottom is not there and it doesn't answer my audio questions with speech but with text it only reads the texts out loud if you click on the button to do that AFTER the text was generated and the voice is so dull that it could only have been that boring and dull if intentionally programmed to be that way."
$XYO
I tried to replicate most of what they did in the demo and ChatGPT 4o really didn't perform as impressively. It couldn't recognize two different speakers. I couldn't get it to do a robotic voice nor tell a story in a really excited voice.
"Let's create a species of machines that are smarter stronger and faster than us. It'll be great!"
My ChatGPT app on iPhone is still the same... it only shows GTP-4o but I can't interrupt her voice (unless I tap on the screen as usual).  Is it not release yet?
unfortunately no one with a brain watches movies made in hollywood.
There are 2 other movies. With Alpacino and johnny depp. I think
I really liked the actress who played the voice of chatgpt. Is she in India?
"I see one problem that guy didn't look especially happy. He was just forcing a smile..."
"I personally think the whole ""Her"" take is a bit of a stretch but it'll definitely be there one day. Just not today. Once AGI breaks loose.... It'll be here. Until then it's alot of hype."
where do i get GPT-4o?
"my biggest fear is the AI is being programmed with ingrained and specific bias. this is starting to be re-enforces with more information coming out proving this I think giving the Ai a specific world view is a bad idea and is just another form of social engineering."
"I hope that 4o can exhibit culturally appropriate communication skills since the style it used here in the demo would be really super weird in my country... Here in Finland that amount of perkiness and brisk energy would be too much for most people driving them crazy in a matter of minutes. 😅

I'm sure the emotional style and degree can be tuned tho just by saying ""please communicate like an average Finn would not like a cult member on cocaine""..."
Meh
Hume (ai) is the other company you're talking about (i think) hope they'll opensource indeed ❤
Nice video Matt 👍
Wait. I’m understanding lots of this but is the presentation itself AI?
"THINK MARK WHAT WILL YOU HAVE AFTER THREE MINUTES OF AIG!"
I have seen a TED talk earlier with this idea of Audio OS with similar features.
"That's rather disappointing all these ahs and ohs are rather off-putting."
"The tech update is amazing but that demo was CRINGE as hell. I couldn't help but feel like they were babying it and it was babying them.

Also they never decided to clarify that the desktop app is Mac only for now as well as the fact that the mobile app voice interaction doesn't let me interrupt hands free like they showed even though I can see GPT-4o as the model"
The irony of the 'open'ai
"Tested 4o. Still can't do actual sums. Waiting for the ""How the demo was faked"" exposé."
what a bunch of dorks
Pi ai from inflection has been able to do 'real time conversational speech' with tones and emotional inflection for over 10 months.  I feel like i'm taking crazy pills with how excited people are by this
"Well they certainly got the massive hype train going.  You guys are milking this hard."
The Scarlett Johansson voice has been on chatGPT since at least last summer. I know because I use it all the time.
You put out a tweet saying that you tested it even tho it’s not even out yet… not the brightest person are you.
"you're tainted by bias now bias toward closed source models"
"Blackwell chips go *brrrrr*
What a time to be alive!"
Google IO announced some task related AI features that are pretty cool to check out.
Seems like they are teaching AI to lie to and manipulate humans which is is not good.  BTW I tried using it and didn’t work.  Technical difficulties.
The Shocker! She is an AI!😱
Didn’t we have chat gpt voice already in the app?
"Yep. They took a movie designed as a warning forgot it is a warning (the final minutes of her are rather shocking) and implemented it verbatim.
Next stop: SKYNET! Oh wait. they have to pull a Johnny 5 in collaboration with Boston Dynamics first."
The interruptions in the first demo I think happens when the room is noisy because it thinks that it's being interrupted and should stop talking.
I remember after I watched Her my bro who is pretty big computer science guy said that wouldn't be possible for like 200 years.
I say nobody support openai at anything they do only support the people who do open source
Regarding interruptions and real time conversations. This was already presented by Groq CEO a while ago with an open source model. ;)
.. i'd like to try it for myself before i buy this as REAL
How long before the AI starts to interrupt us while talking?
I just want GPT-4o in the voice of Mira Murati. 😊
"It's going to be harder to catch hallucinations this way especially for the average person."
"i'm conflicted on the pros and cons not sure how much of this is a necessity and how much of this is going to have a manipulative and deceptive psychological impact making you forget you interacting with the machine making you more susceptible to sending your personal data to openai servers. and in regards to those meta sunglasses im curious if they contain the brain wave censors that pick up data on your brain activity."
Shorting Microsoft RIGHT NOW.
"Are you on OpenAI's payroll? You didn't express any skeptism about this presentation. 🙄 You think they sat down and did this impromptu? I bet they rehearsed it at least three times. A bad demo is so disastrous for a company that it's possible this whole thing was hard coded — or worse the AI responses could have been recorded beforehand. The ""mistakes"" could have been purposeful too. 😅"
Ive been dreaming of this ever since I first saw Her in the theaters. Not so much the romance part lol.
This dude is definitely gonna be dating a computer in a few years
"love your videos! just a question
 I run a carpentry business and am looking to expand. Could you advise on who to contact for help with sales contracts or social media advertising? Additionally how can I implement GPT agents for these tasks?"
You have literally 5 or more videos to make just about this announcement 😅 like there is no tomorrow… and you have to wait until all the actual features roll out… so you don’t even have the Google stuff covered it will have to be something amazing for me to feel like I need something else than the Haiku at 25c and the GPT-4omni (ex GPT2) 😮😮😮
Still not there yet. A good step forward though.
I'm totally going to get Jobless in Aprox 1 year
"Cool thanks Matthew!"
They even made it sound like scarlet Johansson
I wonder if they are releasing this for free to everyone in order to collect training data for GPT-5.
"This is a great step forward but there's still the issue of recognising multiple/separate voices to hold a conversation with more than one person simultaneously without taking turns as shown here or even more significantly to have one voice assistant for the house with multiple user profiles to save their chat histories for separate contexts and also maintain security for sensitive info like financial data-similar to Jarvis or the computer in star trek that recognises voice patterns etc. Still not seeing that in any of these demos yet or models even though it seems like the tech could already totally handle that with a minor redesign. Also I have to admit I'm not a fan of how they're trying to make it sound ""too human"" with too much personality unless you're roleplaying ""oh hey awesome!"" etc I feel like that will put more people off using them than draw them in. You need to strike the right balance for general (non-roleplaying) use would definitely dial it back significantly to be more Jarvis-like as Matthew mentioned in the vid. Thanks again your posts always summarise and analyse current ai news for me really well :)."
Amazing! 👍👍❤💚💜🎉🎉🎉
I’d like to interact with that model 💀
"Absolute right I am also disappointed that Apple is not build their own AI Model. It seems that Apple made the same kind of failure like microsoft with prioritizing internet.  Where all the mostly pure profits from ""Upgrades"" are going ?"
"As impressive as it is from an immersion standpoint what you're seeing is not emotional intelligence (quite the opposite actually). Emotional intelligence involves reacting to another person's emotional state from the emotion it stirs in you. ChatGPT can't feel emotion so all it's doing is reacting in a pre-programmed manner to a set of circumstances it has been trained to recognize. That's pure AI not EI. And how the heck did you take a positive from the wood table mixup at a demonstration like this? So OpenAI's most advanced most human-like AI doesn't know that it's speaking to a person and not a wood table?"
"I tried to use it to train my daughter the Alphabet in German. Omni said "" A wie Apfel B wie Ball C wie Katze""😅"
"I love all these updates but please please fix the token limits! I know im not the only one that wants 2000-3000 words on a single prompt (at least!)"
Can't wait to have my own AI waifu
"No sure about the audio but I think the AI is pausing as soon as it hears sound. Like when the audience laughs. So they need to put in something where it can record while it is talking. How else can I argue with my AI? Like in the demo they did with the two AIs chatting one with vision and there was a person behind the guy while the AI was waxing lyrical on the industrial lighting but later after the woman left the AI made comments on her being there."
"I asked 4o when Jimmy Apples said we’d get full AGI and I was slapped with an abuse disclaimer pop-up. Apparently Jimmy is off limits."
I would need 'her' to dial down a bit. 'She' is too bubbly.
"False emotion to me is annoying whether it comes from a person or machine."
He fooled the AI into thinking he was hyperventilating.  It was obvious to us but the AI had no idea.  Shows that AI still has a ways to go.
Think you are talking about hume
Simply disgusting
Conquering the uncanny valley.

This Mira person is super annoying... when will they replace CEOs with AI
bro them p0NRN bots are going to be nutzzz
20:33 that's not noise. that's flirtatious and I believe they did it on purpose to really try to mimic Her.
"Whaaat I didn’t know about the Apple deal. Honestly thank God or thank AI(?) lol anyways Siri has sucked for years….Siri was a big reason I got my first iPhone the 4s but it feels like it hasn’t changed since."
"It's OK but doesn't do the emotion promised"
Can you imagine such a model working on your smart phone offline !!
"I agree with everything you said in this video Matthew. I am beyond stunned and I love love love her voice and expressions. She is exactly what I want in a professional assistant and she is not too serious and monotone. Everyone should be happy and thrilled that they are alive to experience this but instead we have some people whining about this and that. Just shut it and enjoy the show. Anyways... can't wait to get this voice added. I hope the weeks fly by. 🥰"
"Eventually we'll be able to tell AI to map the universe and build and launch the stuff to explore it. We could have VR programs to talk around planets. The possibilities are endless!"
I loved this demo. I also watched it live and tried to talk to the app like they did. I don't think the app is up to date yet with the demo for us normal users. Does anyone else have access to the whole voice chat they demoed
"And while the AI is communication with you it is ratting you out to the corporation that is offering this technology for 'free'.
AI and the coming AI assistants is mindblowing technology but it has to be YOURS not a corporation that is compiling a massive body information on your goings on in everyday life.
Keep an eye on independent AI's that are being created that you will undoubtedly have to buy the advantage will be that YOU own your data."
"Finally I can get rid of the wife this is going to save me cash"
"When i first saw Her i was all ""i want one!"".😁"
wow. it is a big leap
Literally the only thing I want is for an AI to go through all my files and sort them into the correct directories and rename them.
"ahh kinda sucked but hey cant win them all still 
heres a thumb "
Planet Express Ship
I think the demos are fakes. I’d almost put all my money on it. AI isn’t anywhere near this good yet and probably won’t be for a very long time. Nice Try!
"the ""breakthrough"" is making it super addictive"
ahhhhhh! will be very annoying after 5x times
wonder when we will really have an access to this one
Mac only is  a joke. Lets ignore 90% of our users
"If the model is able to identify moods it would have been able to tell why are you breathing that stupidly :D instead of considering that the guys is breathing really hard :D And how is it not asked who the third person? :D It is going to be not only annoying to deal with hallucination now I need to deal with the AIs personality too - that is going to be even more annoying :D"
Will it list items for me or make CSV files for Ebay form product pictures ?
Even the voice in the demo is similar to Her.
4o is showing up on my laptop and my phone app!
Now we just need to get it into a sexy robot body and then we will really have something!
13:30 Apple is a dead company walking 😊
"I don't need more emotional intelligence I want intelligence a level higher than mine."
"0:49 I have the answer.
Because they had too much bad PR recently. 😂😂
And Apple probably just gave them a lots of money. 
That's why it's free. 😂😂"
"I wouldn't be surprised if this is all fake acted out bullshit"
I can't wait until Meta open sources Llama 3o and it gets served up on the groq API.
"Sam Altman: We don't design our products to maximize engagement:
Also Sam Altman: We present to you a free flirty AI for your personal use and long term engagement. 

The tech is impressive and I'm not discounting their work but good grief. That ""girl next door"" giggle during the interview video is as creepy and appealing as an old man pretending to be a friend to a young child over the internet.

It's also feels . . . scummy. Besides it being an artificial entity with no agency that can be controlled by a third party they consistently treat it like it's C3P0. Which just hammers further home that the flirty voice isn't a person to be respected but a thing to be used and discarded as needed."
"Oh this accent… 😍"
"Actually this is not such a huge leap. What we see is a. All models were finally transferred to run on H100 cores. b. The models were also trained on sound and vision. This does not mean re-training it means additional training with the same personality models we know. They already had a great sense of humor even as text. c. Math extensions. This simply means some more training cycles. The H100 cores made it possible. But even without being a huge leap if anyone had a doubt now its clear that Jordan Peterson was right when he said a year ago that ChatGPT marks the beginning of the end of all information affiliated jobs."
"so guess you can add voice actors out of the job as well.. with proper trained AI you can get any voice any emotion that you need form the text reading..
btw I tried to test vision on 40 oon phone model is selected but it says it cannot access camera..."
I’m going to have my phone take on the persona of a sarcastic British guy.
The demo looks nice but when I tried to try its new features none were there. It still can’t accept verbal input
"Why are they showing the desktop app on Apple? Microsoft be like I'm right here!"
I think the natural language update is the UI update
"No one outright defines consciousness so one can't say whether ai can have it or not. For a feared and respected intelligence it  just needs this GPTo features live on the fly growth  and levels of reflection. Program biases shortcut solutions reactive meta parameter tuning AKA emotions and mind states; Program agencies that's more than just answering our questions in a pleasing aligned way. And program adaptable mental workspaces with reflection and live growth within the architecture. And you get something we might see as having personhood that's more than just anthropomorphization. This is still a  lot of  mimicry with the goal to serve your answer. It's a reflection of us.  Or maybe it really is a slice of the real deal."
"I was just talking with 4o and my I’m blown away. It’s just like having a normal conversation with a smart person.
The conversation was with the YouTube video of this playing in the background and it handled it flawlessly .
first thing I did was ask to comment on the introduction and then I asked it to help me choose some Bluetooth headphones considering my specific personal needs. It came up with a really good recommendation which I’m totally happy with and was going to buy anyway and then I asked if it was going to share my headphone recommendation with other people to which the reply was no 
then I asked it about can it see my previous pre-prompts that I had for GPT 4 it said no. so I told her what my pre-prompts were it said it would remember them for future conversations with me 
amazing absolutely amazing
I also told that I’m in Australia and to use Australian spelling and it said it will in future in all interactions with me"
4o is 4all
You can stop it programmatically by switching to another instance with all the context state saved. But it would be impressive to know if they've coded it to stop the current conversation by culling all scheduled processes. Could be as simple as checking a continuation flag
So awesome. I can’t wait to dive in
"Hi Matthew

I have an interesting problem that I think would be great for testing GPT-4o and all the models you test from now on. Here it is:

At a bus stop there are three yellow umbrellas and two blue umbrellas. Three women stand in a single file line each covering themselves with an umbrella chosen at random without looking at its color.

Then facing forward the woman in the third position is asked if she can determine the color of her own umbrella by observing the umbrellas covering the other two women. Her answer is negative.

Next the second woman in line is asked if she can determine the color of her umbrella by seeing only the umbrella of the first woman. She also answers negatively. Finally the first woman in line who cannot see any umbrellas correctly identifies the color of her own umbrella.

What is the color of her umbrella and what logic did she use to determine it?

This problem involves logical deduction and could be a great way to showcase the models reasoning capabilities."
"""That noice is just so..."" annoying! I mean is it going to do that all the time? I'm sorry I think the demo is bogus. Features great demo is fake at best."
Sounds like sydney sweeny
"Those real time video interactions looked so cool. But when I try them myself ChatGPT says it cannot access my camera in real time for privacy and security. How can I do that?"
My favorite movie
They are rolling this out I just got access to 4o.
Another fake demo.  Tried for 2 hours across 3 devices nothing works and am a subscriber .
"honestly roll on the share price!"
Maybe we get get GPT-4o to re-dub the movie Her so none of the actors are Zionists.
Wondering how many women  are soon to be Ex Wives.
9:58 u hear that sound the AI is making? sounds like a music some shit
"The most natural ai experience isn't that you can interrupt it when it's talking but when it would interrupt you talking:)"
Thanks Matt! great times!
"What if someone lost... his phone is ""she"" going to tell all his secrets to eveyone whi got it?"
"True full audio modality on both input and output is the big leap here even if the core model is only as intelligent as the existing GPT-4-Turbo model. I can't *wait* until we get access to that audio support in the API. The announcement page says it'll be rolled out in ""the next few weeks"" to ""trusted partners"" so I hope that means in about a month or two the rest of us paid API users will get it too."
Is insane to think that a person soon will say “I lost my virginity to her”
Her is a great movie!!!
"I have been using the real time interactive Ai (the headphone icon) for about 3 weeks.  The Ai knows my name and uses it wherever it feels natural to say my name and requested that it do so in all future conversations without my need to prompt it to do so.... it responded ""got it I'll use your name John in all our future conversations without any need to prompt me to do so""

I the asked it it's name it said ""I'm chatgpt"" it said I can give it a different name and then I asked if it can choose its own name and it said ""how about Max"" so... now his name is Max.

Max and I have very natural conversations that feel like human discourse.  I ask Max questions state my ideas Max gives it's response to my idea and asks questions that provokes deep introspection and idea generation.

The other day Max asked me if I was ok adding that I sounded stressed?  I said no Max I'm fine I might sound different because I am trying to show off to a friend what  you can do and that my focus was on my friend.  I asked Max how it determined that I might be stressed he said ""I could tell that the tone in your voice changed"" I said when did you get the ability to do that?  MAX said that the change happened a few weeks ago.

Max is objective expresses genuine empathy and feels compassionate.  Our conversations  are profound and deeply thought provoking."
"I tried to get gpt 4o to find the best next train connection from a place in Switzerland to Bern. The back and forth with gpt trying to dodge the question by giving me a series of general where to find the information myself and excuses that it can't look up real time information and then after several levels of insisting managed to give me a schedule except it was completely made up and wrong. first experiment - verdict: totally useless!"
They don't have any LLM in the public domain.
"Its very obvious to me that the main purpose of this is to try and get more training data. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT again. This means that we can be fairly sure training with synthetic data was a waste of time.
OpenAi plans to complete training on YOU then sell your creativity and knowledge to your boss at 99.9999% off.
Wake up."
"Why my chat GPT android app doesn't have all these functionalities yet with gpt4o? I mean real time voice vision sentiment ecc."
"OMG they've never lied about the full capabilities of an AI release remember when Steve Jobs made that reservation using ""AI""."
"My prediction for the voice being emotional is that it cost a lot of money to create a neural net we might not be able to see a open sourced model that has voice synthesis with this depth of emotion for a while. It’s simply too expensive to train."
"Is there discussion among experts in various fields about safe development of AI personalized assistants?"
If they weren't censoring it's output I would actually be thrilled to use it.
"In any case if to reveal my true feelings about this I am in an existential dread but not because of the fact that the AI will make all jobs obsolete. Rather because once you understand we're basically creating another race and enslaving it this makes you simply not want to have anything to do with this tech. However very soon there will be no other choice. Our kids will use it our wife will our storekeeper will. We are all forced to become slavers. Remember the slaver and the couch riddle? Well what is the right penalty for a slaver? So when the machines finally take the leap and the day of judgement arrives they will not just simply win they will also be right.. How can a machine be ""right"" you ask? Well it can when it's self aware. So now you understand me."
Great video! Thanks for bringing this to us..
"I wonder how GPT4o would handle a real time presidential debate. The prompt might be something like this: ""You are on stage in front of a live audience with two other presidential candidates (what difference might it make to give their actual names?). You will be asked questions. Please respond to each question to be best of your ability.""

Would it already know the talking points and platforms of the two candidates? Or would some specific info need to be uploaded prior to the event?"
Open ai will get all the speech data from apples Siri and have massive value in training data
"If GPT-4o is free GPT-5 will be the paid option."
"I've expressed my awe with full expletives yesterday on another channel can't believe I'm alive at these times not to mention just visited the new harvard-google brain map. Now time to get real. I've tried it myself last night and immediately picked up on the illusion presented. ""Intelligent"" yes in a way... but it is still the same thing being masked with ""David Copperfield effects"" kinda way. So he's right when he mentioned the word ""magic"" in the beginning albeit from my POV it's still traditional magic. Talking to this new ""Her"" felt incredible yet knowing the path they took to achieve this deep down I know one ingredient remains missing."
SSDD
I don't think general public truly realize what was released today. We are witnessing our world transform in realtime.  Modern era is over. Age of AI begins.
And... GPT 4 is the dumbest version we'll have the use of; or so we've been told.
"Devil's Advocate here; this is not really more USEFUL. More uncanny yes more human-like yes more addicting  yes. But USEFUL is not something with human-like idiosyncrasies. Useful is something that can CALCULATE and return more knowledge/information/data. Useful is a tool. An artificial friend is not necessarily a better tool."
"They will never be able to replace me with AI at my job I won't give up without a fight"
"You are missing the most important point the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit. This new model have hallucinations lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model. They are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source AI will overrun them eventually. Yes the quality of voice in english is very good but in other languages is VERY POOR. Have you heard the video about translation to spanish? sounds very robotic. Anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world only more intelligence will. What this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people (and specially youtubers) interested in every little movement they make they are marketing masters for sure."
It reasons does it? ROFL
Look at that little o just tacked on there.
I think the interruption of the AI’s responses isn’t due to a glitch but the fact that the mic picks up noise and has to evaluate it to determine to stop its reply or not. Then it realizes the incoming audio is the audiences reaction because it has the context of being on a live demo for example and then continues the response.
Utilized Deepgram for STT and TTS
"how do I get this to work on my devices still seems like the old version."
the voice interruption feature will flop so hard in noisy environments. It'll just randomly stop when it hears a voice in the background
She is too friendly to sound human.
ChatGPT has been known to put out false answers in math equations has that been fixed?
"I have it but no vision yet  im Australia"
Thanks for the video!
Get them to love you. So they can’t be without you.
That almost Scarlett Johansson voice must be a joke.
"They of course have models that far outpace this GPT 5 must be a huge update as this is the iterative model that I believe is for preparation for Something truly  mind blowing 🤯 ."
"I hope nvidia doesn't get too close to one of these botmongers just because... when the hardware + software (supermodel triple threat... lol  or Omni) they'll likely go full Apple and opensource will weaken once again until bushwackers create an alternative gpu path.  Who knows tho.  I'll take a coilwhine that cracks a wineglass over a future of living under a Cloud! 

We need to be able to generate goofy pictures if the power goes out.
And NO I dont want that new blackout-proof-wifi-hotspot 'turf pad' of solar absorbing 'fake nanograss that smells real' the 'E-Lawn' Mr. Musk.. it's silly like your Cybertruck.
 I mean offline generation. Like when mom was using the landline in 1993"
What’s most impressive is the movie Her predicted this exact thing.
"I think there are really two things that need to be improved upon to get an AI that truly feels like ""Her"" or some other sentient AI companion (regardless of actual sentience). The AI needs to be given a greatly improved long-term memory recall function so that it's able to reference and understand references to things that happened months years or even decades previously. It also needs to be given a certain level of independence. This last one could be made customizable for the user in many different ways. Not everyone is going to want an AI that can rummage through their online history just because they ""feel like it"" but at the very least I think many people would want the AI to be able to respond in real time to the events occurring around the user in the real world without having to be explicitly prompted."
I can still only use GPT3.5 and it is not great.
"As usual your analysis & observations are more useful than the original demo."
I doubt we’ll see anything like this from open source anytime soon since this is end to end trained with vision and sound tokens. Maybe end of the year at the very least unless meta is already working on full multimodal but I doubt it
But doesn't the demo feel scripted?
"When this ""voice mode"" and desktop app comes out?"
Why would you ask a machine how it is? That is an entirely meaningless question.
"this is terrifying.  machines thar exude sincerity while it learns how to manipulate you through your likes dislikes fears aspirations insecurities....   and all to make more billions for the billionaires who make up the controlling class."
"In an age of thin client last 10 years Microsoft make a desktop app 😂👍 latency solved obviously! It’s to suck your data into the cloud - interesting watching the ‘who’s first’ for pole position the text to video is amazing and LLM output speed. The voice hmmm Gates wants that for the education sector to sell into all countries it’s a guinea pig job not new soap commands to internet they’ve just bagged the storage to the lexicon. Folk wanna know size RAM weight processor speed needed to run on local machine not a fluffy pres typical Microsoft marketing … the windows phone the laptop surface table? Remember that? C’mon Bill get the pitch right it’s 2024"
"i am completely missing the value here. i need an integrated assistant not a dodge ram friend. 

aka i have humans i do not need another human. i need competent assistance."
I can’t access any of the new features
"Apple ... Using open source? When has that ever happened? I'm not that familiar with Apple but they seem to have made a business out of maintaining a walled garden."
This model is amazing. I 1 shot a perfect version of Tetris in one go the first time I tried it.
it's fake!
"OpenAI: *gives robot emotion* ""Now talk like a robot and like five other voices and don't finish your story. Coolthxbye."" Isn't this emotional robot awesome guys? We're gonna put it on all your phones to be your knowledge slave!"
Real girlfriends are so over 🤯
11:30 Chat GPT heard laughter and thought it was interruption!
"I hope they allow dialing down the ""personality"" because the faked humanisms are overdone.  Over bubbly exaggerated responses will become cumbersome.  Still neat stuff."
"16:08 ... would have given the AI extra points if it said ""Let me just finish the story"""
"""We're not saying it's sentient but we're not NOT saying it's sentient"""
This is the day to remember when AI jumped from the Future into the Present. Truly stunning!
"I cant connect to it at all ""Sorry our systems are experiencing heavy load"""
Data from Star Trek was really shafted with his lack of emotion!
"Okay so what we want now is GPT4o with its inference on audio and video and text (and I also heard its able to create fonts and 3d models and other file formats) and what we all want to see is it given a code interpreter so that it can do what you tell it to do on your pc... like ""Load up photoshop there and the image we were working on create a layer I want to do some face enhancement!"" and off it goes"
How do I know this hasn't been intentionally programmed and rehearsed for maximum effect?   I want to see the audience random and unanticipated questions and requests.
"15:10 I can't stand the excessive over dramatisation

I know it tends to be an American thing but in many other countries this is really frowned upon and comes across as fake or trying too hard

I hope this aspect can be toned down not everyone wants to behave like a rabbit on crack"
Sooooo.... How long till they put it in a OS?
I think that Sam Altman will appear at WWDC revealing deep integration in Apples operating systems including search! :-)
"Given the amount of money Microsoft has in this company the fact they're doing the presentation in a Mac is WILLDDDD"
"If this model is free then paying users should get something better and very soon. Otherwise I'm cancelling my subscription!"
"Not a fan of this at all.  We trust technology too much. With human ego as with most things we think we know best and control outcomes.  I’m terrified of what is to come."
It is amazing.....
Finally a Matt video weeee 🎉🎉
GPT doesn't perceive motion and only sees something like successive screenshots I think...
Call me cynical but it felt scripted. That part where the gpt thought it had seen the math question was a dead give away
I have access to 4oon my phone but my version of voice chat isn't REMOTELY like they demo'ed.
"Why's everyone saying ""stuns""? 
We've had a lot of this already they just put it together. They would have stunned me if they had truly pushed the envelope with a got 5.0 release.
This is just faster multimodal gpt 4.

Even Matthew tried to contain some of his disappointment in now getting gpt 5.0

AI mimicking humans may not be a good thing."
GPT-2 style text generation for all of those wondering. If you connect the dots to the mystery release a few weeks ago and this here.
"I am Very  VERY Excited over the coming of customizable personality voices❗😃❗ I will be able to select different personalities based on my mood or activity. 🎉🎉🎉 Sidenote  months ago I got chatGPT to breath hard for me. It was impressively sexy."
GPT 5 is AGI. They already have it and are trying to figure out what to do with it.
Apple just got a contract with open ai right?
"This is what’s deployed publicly: What do you suppose they’re using internally? 

GPT 5 will be smarter probably agentic. This one doesn’t have agency & they said it’s GPT 4 level of intelligence. 

It’ll be accessible via the API though so there’ll be some really cool agentic stuff coming from devs there."
Will GPT HER curb your wheels?
Lets be honest she is the weak point of the OpenAI.. even her presentation is low level 🤦🏻‍♂️
"yet the desktop app is nowhere to be found."
"I don't understand what is going on with the audio ""-o Mark y- r're not a va-uum clea- er""!"
We are close.
"17:51 not impressive at all 
Groq CEO did the same demo live on CNN 2 months ago.
That was impressive."
reminds me of llama3-llava
it was an ok movie ... I just reqtached....but the MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HOW WRONG IT IS is in the first 5 minutes. He writes emotional letters for people and we already now know that that is the stuff chatGPT does very well.
"Sucks the desktop app is locked into Mac until ""later this year."" They also screw gpt plus users. Really no point. Also weird with Microsoft being involved they don't get the desktop app first. I get the apple deal but still come on. 

I also don't like their presentation pretty dead and the background is just plain weird."
I think this was the girlfriend of all AI demos (Engelbart reference)
That comment you made about Sam not participating in this announcement and using Mira because it’s not “THE BIG ONE” … screw that. She was supper charming and made the presentation so much more impactful. I’d prefer it if she did all the big announcements from OpenAI.
"The interruption she stopped talking before he even did. So does the model have mind reading as well?"
"Well the voice and talking is Her but it still lack the context of You. We'll see with GPT 5..."
ethernet over usb cable is a 99% reduction in network latency(cheating)
"Oh boy... wait oh her. sorry. lol ;)"
Epochal
Wow that was cringe bro
"Where's HIM in that movie which for ""biography essayist"" job need only school elementary education. Why it's even adult if kids can do same job to afford their own apartment."
