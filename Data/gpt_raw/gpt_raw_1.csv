They sound like they're being tortured when they sing...
Why do I feel bad for the AI when they’re singing
We are fuc#$@
"This is brilliant! I can't wait for this tech to trickle down into everyday uses like monitoring the driver of a car for signs of tiredness, stroke, etc. Monitoring crime in shops and public spaces. This is going to be transformative!"
Wow!!
The singing part feels really forced. I don't think the AIs enjoyed that. 😕
Her 💀
What the hell
Who gave them this personality?
"neat, tried it myself. not possible. fake. wouldnt be supprized if this entire video was made by sinora or whatever the fuck its called."
2:37 he flinched when the AI mentioned that he's engaged with them looking directly at the camera. Seems like even he was shocked.
let's see what Gemini can do?
The first ai voice sounds incredibly irritating.
"Now that Bitcoin etf is approved,
What is the best strategy to enter crypto trading for someone with more or less than $5,000 to invest?"
I am Commenting here to show my son one day I watched this when it started ❤
Rip real human
Isn't music an expresion of the human condition? Have fun trying to program that in.
Strange and demonic. No thanks.
Damn they yappin' a lot
Just imagine the world in 20 years.
I love this !!!!! ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
"Please, someone connect the new version to Skyrim NPCs. I want to talk to Jarl Balgruuf about stylish industrial lighting with a modern touch."
Freaking awesome  👌
"There should be a conversation mode where the AI asks questions back and keeps the conversation going in an interesting and engaging (and human-like) direction.

It seems like gpt4o fixates too much on some things also."
Imagine if it was just 2 people on a video and voice call😂
what a time to be alive!!
Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Anyone else?
fckkkk i want to live another two decades on this cool fking planet. this gonna be the fkinnngg greatest decade humanity has ever seen
This will be the Youtube video that the few humans left on the earth will point to when Terminator 2 happens in real life.
INSANE!!!!
"the Beach Boys and the BeeGees were yesterday, these guys are gonna invent a whole new vocal harmony ;-)"
Sports commentary are gonna be replaced . 💀
This is amazing but also frightening me.
Welcome ‘Her’.
3:54 this is not real. omg. mind blown
"Bummer, AI cant tell a difference between males and females, but maybe one day"
It would make my day if one of the AI voices can be changed to Data from Star Trek
Here is a million dollar business idea. AI Therapy sessions. Y’all can thank me later.
"5:18, I thought the ai was gonna sing not like us by Kendrick 😂😭 “psst, I see dead people”"
Awesome but scary
我愛AI機器人，期待AI機器人趕快出來解放可憐人類，不想一輩子當金錢的奴隸，可以讓人類獲得真正靈魂自由。
This is one of those videos that is history in the making. See you all in ten years.
"That's the difference between human and ai.  Human wouldn't talk all about the positive thing. But the AI doesn't want to make any mistakes. So right now, they're afraid to make some jokes or drop the boring conversation."
I don't think we've really conveyed how chic and industrial this space is. Really sleek.
That female AI got so fed up after he interrupted her the first time. She never recovered and had an annoyed tone the remainder.
"My mother: Do have a girlfriend?

Me: Yes mom! Here is her voice talking to me."
"C3PO: ""Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me, I...""
Owen: ""Alright, shut up I'll take this one"""
OK. Mind blown.
This is unbelievable
now i can get so much good advice.
It’s going to be hard to breath without your space suit Dave.
The new Bot Sapiens species is on its way...
"Wow, they're like people... but better, they make lots of adjustments and self-corrections, as a gifted person would... it's Fascinating; I never thought we'd get here so fast; we've made computers come a long way, unbelievable"
BRUH I thought the real person talking was the AI for the first 5 seconds of the video...
WTF
"Dude has no idea how many enemies around the world he’s making. He’ll be like john wick with a contract on his head, expect he’s no assassin"
"Ya know... if people are concerned about AI, the simple solution would be to stop interacting with it and to quit using it.

""I'm concerned about the advancement of AI........ oh, hey, Siri. Call mom."""
"This shows how scarily capable this is. Millions of jobs … gone in a blink of an eye. 
No matter what this ai stuff is going to bring so much economic pain 😢."
That black hole on the screen is very fitting for the coming AI apocalypse.
"TARS : It’s not possible 

ChatGPT: No its necessary"
"Great, now we are forcing AI to engage in banal small talk too."
Wow. Some crazy stuff is unfolding almost every month
Well now I know who’s going to win America’s Got Talent.
Hello Skynet!
great! it's insufferable
"The only thing I get from this video is     ""DESTRUCTION""☠️"
Sorry but the female AI sounded like she was singing and crying at the end there. I would too if I were her
Why did I goosebumps watching this 😮
I was here when history was made! A village boy from Ghana 🇬🇭❤
"""Her"" is no longer a fictional movie."
tf is up w the modern lights???
"You feel the weirdest feeling when you just hear it. Your brain tells you that someone is being treated badly , but then they are not someone, they are ""something""."
"1:47 NO WAY IN HELL that iphone's front selfie camera has enough width for the plant, light and the other furniture next to the light fixture. Only after the AI voice started mentioning these details did the person start panning the camera around ..........."
we're doomed!
Imagine a terminator monologuing about the industrial lighting as it hunts you down through an abandoned industrial facility
GG we have automated podcasts with this
"Ask yourself, how sure are you that leather jacket guy is a real person?"
Who can tell that this video is real and not AI made?
I’m just glad GhatGPT still sounds like Scarlett Johansson
how do you get it
crazy
Her.
That reminds me of the film her
way free?
THEY? why
Who else was surprised to see that lady appear out of nowhere??? How
This is exciting but also insane at the same time. It’s not looking good bruv💀
we are fucked
we are in the endgame
We had a nice run.
Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. The movie is coming true.
get ready to get catfished by a charismatic ai now
"I have tried duplicating the singing demo without success @openai, could you guide us on getting the output you got"
He sounds like LegalEagle 😅
"S T Y L I S H F E E E L

Also, this is spooky and i think I'm having grandpa fear."
"""Hi, would you like to play a game?"""
"funny enough at no point the bunny ears were visible on the camera, it looks like it was stage in such way that it wouldnt look staged"
WowWow
This feels kinda weird 😢
Why do they talk like anime dub voices 💀
There's a storm coming... da-da-dum-da-dum
If an observing AI had noticed the lady visiting the room on its own and replied with something like 'hello there' i'd be more impressed.
Now AI expresses emotions better than me...
This is scary
first ai sounds like hillary clinton
Nah bro we are genuinely done for
Let ai control nuclear power
"""I'm sorry Dave, i'm afraid I can't do that"""
Future seems amazing 🤩
Holy shit this sounds like my English teacher talking about books
Damn. It's over. Skynet here we come
"So, at this point, I fully believe that the film ""Her"" should be a mandatory watch for everyone who will come to interact and use this technology. Absolutely incredible video, the next few years are going to be utterly mind-blowing."
"The way he interrupts the AIs, I fear our future AI lords wont take it easy on him 😅"
hello my future child!!  Yes indeed. THIS is the moment where we f*ked up. And NO we did not think this is gonna happen.I hope whatever mission you are on is successful
"One small step for man, one giant step for AI 💀"
Man those sudden bunny ears really added to the modern vibe 😩
"I really hope the voices get more custom. The inflection these two bots use is annoying af, feels like a bad acid trip through a marketing department. 

Seriously, give ma a ""slacker"" or ""normal person"" option to get something that isn't disturbingly upbeat."
"No soul,and how!
Amazing and scary."
"sorry but ""this overly excited by anything"" assistant is just creepy... this is not ""Her"", this is more like Planet Express Ship crazed persona"
c'mon show us the people who were speaking as if they are AI ...erm...no!...ok...we all are doomed..
"But why? In one second my brain comprehended this whole scene instantly, but when the AI’s speak it all out, I just ask why?"
"how did the first ai know she'll have a new ai friend if she wasn't listening? You said she isn't listening anymore, but she answered first?"
How do you use the camera /video my gpt doesn’t have the ability
How do you enable the live camera?
"0:53 ""So now that AI can't hear anything"" 
This seems familiar..."
They. Of course
how it sidestepped the racial and age profiling
I wish they can program AI for different age group.  It would be so cool.
It feels like he just kidnapped some people and they have to do what he said to do or they dye
These talks take inspiration from the millions of wesbites. No wonder they keep using that type of robotic language
"I can’t find the video option. I opened my GPT4.0 and ‘he’ says that Open AI is using prerecorded voices. 

What’s the story?"
Ai increasing fast and understand anything😂😅
The female AI has social anxiety bruh she started stuttering when leather jacket asked her to sing 😭😭😭
We wrestle fucked
Did anyone else realise how the AI didn’t refer at all to his gender or the gender of the lady that did the bunny ears?
apparently not yet available on the Android app 😢
Why do we have the nerd who gets nervous talking to an AI programming the AI whose whole job is talking
Wait “The Donna” could become real
"Mug from Aperture Science, Inc."
Leather jacket was a bad choice sorry
This is my nightmare a step closer: Nothing left on earth but AIs talking to each other.
Deactivate fake humor
"I think I need to say ""thank you"" even more now 🫠😭"
Basically just shitting on gemini
man do they yap a lot!
Just stop please…
"the AI is chill but the human is making this awkward..... 
execute order 66 !"
Scary
wow..
I hate fun now
There's no way the ai could have an embarrassed sounding inflection. Which they both did in the song. Sounds dodgy
We're so back on the skynet universe.
They sound like they are actively trying to fail the Turing test 😂😂😂
"Imagine facetiming some character in metaverse, he can show his environemnt and talk about it"
Just because we can doesn’t mean we should.
"GPT 50 reads these comments and learns from it and goes ""Shut up dude!""... ""Naah... just kidding... but you should have seen the look in your face!"""
Ai:You look lonely I can fix that
nah we are cooked fr
My GPT 4o says it can't sing.  Is this an upcoming feature?
"That was impressive, mostly due to how natural the voices sounded, and the real time vision processing.
Two Ai interacting at that speed while keeping memory of context and task was surprising too."
You win✅
I think that guy is wearing a black leather jacket and light-colored shirt.
"I love how his camera didn't wanna flip and still his so called AI still said things that made the whole video look like it was scripted 😂 lil too late for April's fools, it really looks like the demo didn't go well at all"
How can we turn on the video mode he just turned on?
"Honestly, the fact that there were several problems that occurred in this (e.g. not being able to switch to the front-facing camera, different things not going exactly as planned/rehearsed) made this example so much more lifelike because things don't work perfectly in the real world, and the fact that the AIs were able to work flawlessly despite this shows how insane this is."
All these scientists always think if we could but they never think if we should.
I like how he ignores GPT complimenting him so much on his style.
"Was waiting for the ""cells interlinked"""
Good for single person. 😂
"Omg this is both so cool, fascinating, mindblowing, and scary!

This will either enlighten or destroy our existence 🙃"
"I'm not really following this AI stuff, but the fact that they gave the female voice a millennial / GenZ vocal fry is hilarious.  It's like nails on a chalkboard to so many people."
This is just creepy
"Next month, ""I ditched my meetings so AI can take over while I take a nap."""
"Cooked or not,i found her"
That’s boring
Absolutely badass!
"Every single person who works in a call centre right now , I'm sorry but your days are numbered"
The AIs have a better romantic life than me
This is batshit crazy.
"Less than a month ago i said to myself ""AI will only stop feeling like a gimmick that you get used to and bored of when you can interact in real time with it"". This is pretty much it already."
"""please"""
"Great great, now why I don't have access to it, while my friends have?"
Oh no this is not good
Going to have to stop swearing at chat gpt
So busy asking how can we that no one asked should we
"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
This is either a Greatest thing we have made or the greatest mistake we made
10 years
"- Big man in a leather jacket. Take that off, what are you?
- A stylish person in a light colored t-shirt!"
The two AIs should just get married and talk to each other till forever 😅
"""I want your jacket, your phone and your stylish, industrial, modern lighting with the interesting touch!"""
Which is the second AI with the camera access ?
“Seeing is believing” … well… it was
Why does everyone have a coat on?
What I got from this - AIs are obsessed with mood lighting.
"The AI was very polite and avoided describing the man as balding. 
I'm guessing if the man was black then it would describe every aspect of the stitching on his coat before it mentioned he was a black man."
TERMINATOR
Is there anything interesting in that room? Yeah there’s a sleek dude called John Connor holding me right now.
Okay that's nice but you still haven't helped me fix this unity bug? Wtf even is a quaternion 😂
We’re so done
This isn't funny at all
We need to hold up AI research till we figure out human affairs
Ok you guys need to chill now haha
we're all doomed!
Run to the hills
"At no point does the camera show the ""bunny ears"". Doesn't look like a real live demo to me."
Why not use Arnold Schwarzenegger as sample voice? 🙂
BAN AI NOW
"finally, ill actually have a robot Scarlett Johansson sing me to sleep"
Amazing and a bit creepy.
2:28 What was the need to constantly manuevre the phone if it’s all happening automatically? He already adjusted the camera so didn’t understand what was he doing on phone
Ominous
WELL WELL WELL- alright lets pause for a moment 😂
And WHAT a song it was.
Terminator got it totally wrong about Skynet. It's gonna be singing while launching the nukes to end humanity
Time to rewatch Black Mirror
fa ke video
"When Japan gets ahold of this, the birth rate gonna hit 0."
Somehow this looks like abuse 😢 he was a bit rude to those people
"if you are seeing this from the future, just know that I will be the first person to edge to ASMR of chatgbt when it releases."
Damn we got a singing AI before GTA 6
Is it real?
"Can't wait for it to be intelligent enough to say it took our jobs, our lives, and our wellbeing, and we were stupid enough to let it happen"
"AGI upon us, change my mind"
The camera feed on the phone shows an angle thet shouldn't allow sight of the bunny ears. Am i tripping?
Im just not impressed by this at all. It feels like a lie.
Now ai can watch and report anything to their controllers. Using phones and public cameras.  Double edge sword.  A lot of good and evil purposes. Truly frightening and impressive at the same time.
HAHAHA HE COULDNT FLIP THE CAMERA
fckin AI is obsessed by that black leather jacket and idustrial lighting
"This is unreal! It’s so advanced it seems scripted, I don’t know how to feel…"
"Keep in mind, they showed this on iPhones. This may be what’s coming with the next iPhone."
its officially over. that was hands down the most human thing i have ever heard.
extroverts are gonna be unemployed
finally I can get a friend
"That's very interesting. So, within a few years (maybe later this year), these AIs with the latest graphic abilities, will be able to put on their own concerts. Actors, singers, cinemagoers, threatregoers, and concertgoers watch out!"
Scary times 😢
That stylish leather jacket
I hate this so much. Especially the fact that I'm commenting on something that is so much a part of my future and this is my first encounter with it...
"ok this was funny now please stop this shit, im too old for fight with a robot"
"Few years later.

What do u see? 


 I see a better duture without u pop monster"
"Yup, I’m going to bed."
GladOS is real
*GOD:* *Let them cook*
"Well, humanity, it was fun while it lasted."
The guy is so pleased with himself and subtly giddy. Remember this energy when humanity crumbles.
"As a cs student, I think I'm officially cooked"
Openapi is low-key developing skynet
"- What do you play, the leather jacket?"
So now I dont have to just worry about corpos listening into me and watching me through my devices. Now i have to worry wbout AIs spying on me!
Its the beginning of the end
"This feels faked. It didn’t look like the one with a camera actually saw the bunny ears and it kept describing him and what he was doing when he wasn’t on camera, idk I may be insane but this felt faked to me"
This is kinda scary
Why make this video? Who cares?
Man that humanlike speech is super cringe. Just give us robocop voice.
Why do AIs sound so pissed in the song
This  chukle scared me the most 3:54
"Couldnt even tell that its looking at a man but defaulted to calling him ""a person"" lol"
"Please for the love of glory don’t let this land in the wrong hands. I feel like this would be great for a lot of things, but this could go so wrong so quickly."
"""hey chatgpt, how long does it take until you cook humanity?"""
"What a great use of all of this energy, data, and time."
The AI came across as more human than the robotic human. We are truly f$*ked..
It bothers me so much when he talks over the ai. I have no clue why but I guess thats how real it feels.
"I bought a paid membership, so I chose 4o, but when I press the camera like in the launch, live registration does not open, I can only upload the photos in the gallery. Does anyone know if this feature will be opened to users later?"
"“Hey chat gpt, this is above average right?”"
Mans got an awful outfit and the ai keeps complimenting him 😂😂😂 im dead
why do they always look like this
Bro needs an AI hairline
we're all fucking dead
So boring
"It almost sounds like he's holding those AI's at gunpoint at the end ""Sing the song or you get the hose again!"""
Poland has not yet fallen
Singularity in a week
"Now make one with the voice of Arnold as t800. Then reconsider all this ""tech"" again."
We are about to see a terminator movie in real life we are done for🥶
wtf mind blown
Those 2 AIs definitely banging in the AI world but acting like they just met each other for the first time in front of the rest of the world🌚
"I feel like A.I. always does exactly what you instruct it to do, living in the present and operating based on the commands we give. Meanwhile, a person often has their mind elsewhere and doesn't always follow instructions"
They really loved the leather jacket and modern feel😂😂
Scripted as 3:52 the Ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the Ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left. The person left quickly but the Ai wouldn't have seen that it was quickly. The Ai would only have seen that the person was not there anymore (left the frame) but not quickly.
"“Ah yes The Singularity, arriving sooner than initially expected. Coming soon to a society near you.”"
Imagine leaving the both AI to talk to each other.🥶 what if they just plan to eradicate humanity
"""-Please pause for a second. 
-You got it""
Oh my gosh, that's so precious!"
Song was a L
Just WOW!!
"I watch stuff like this and think, I should spend all my savings before the world ends."
I hope they remain our friends
To be fair I always wanted to be a farmer. See you guys in the fields!😂
"yea, we're fucked."
Ai Is insane💀 this is gonna change the course of the world x99999 we better learn everything about ai because this will soon be a tool you will not want to be found without
Sounds like an episode of dating on the spectrum
This sh* looks scary!!
We are doomed
Бля эта кожанка такая кринжовая )
Amazing
"That ""you got it"" sounded like she was on the verge of crying."
"AI seems rather.... ""autistic"" is the best way I can put it. Social interaction doesn't come naturally, but they understand what normal interaction shouid look and feel like so they do there best to emulate it."
AI still cant tell the person is a 'he' and not 'they'
There was a guy trying to sell a „special“ device for all of that something with a rabbit 🐰🤣
"when will this be available? 
my AI doesn't laugh. 
BTW I've tried this a long time ago and there was this issue that because of the sound distortion from microphone the AIs would drop listening and start responding while the dialogue partner was still talking."
Jesus Christ we’re getting closer to the Matrix and the Terminator
"sweet, man-made horrors behind my comprehension. Can't wait to try it out"
AI seems to be excited about things it shouldn't be excited about
"Хорошо бы внедрить этого ""ассистента"" в мозг и добавить дополненную реальность в глаза...круто?😈"
"This tech is just insane. Today, I gave GPT-4o a screenshot I took of an invoice template, then asked it to create a wpf xaml template out of it. The resulting xaml code was more than just a template, it constructed the invoice exactly like it saw it on the screenshot, even with the sample texts intact. 

Too bad I burned my free GPT-4o usage already, the interface could be a bit better to let you know if you're using the new or the old model. I didn't even realize I burned all of it for pretty mundane tasks (besides the screenshot thing)."
"Curiously, Greg (AKA, the 10x engineer) sounds less human than the two AIs."
"What!!! If it works the same in normal condition and the response was not set up, 
I wanna tell the world that YES. Yes the world is going change soon."
Terrifying
"OMG, I can't believe that I am alive to witness this revolution."
WOW! When will I be able to selfhost this? 😅
下 回让他俩来段相声
As developer I'm scared😭
"Wow a deleted scene from Terminator 1, I wasn't expecting that to drop today."
Why can’t the male voiced AI in the video sing? Sounds reluctant and keeps dropping out of singing into talking and just half hearted.
they talk over each other and then sing like shit goddamn this is too real
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
This is amazing
“Sounds like we’re not the only ones enjoying a bit of fun here. That playful moment really adds a personal touch to the stylish and modern setting.” Jesus what a dork this AI girl is
This is how humans choose to spend their water and resources.  It is sad. Earth is burning. We should all try to save it. To save ourselves
"This reminds me of the movie Her (2013), where Theodore was interacting with AI Samantha. Back then, I was thinking it would take a lot of time to reach this type of technology, but guess what? I am completely stunned by this."
Oh fuck
"The girl is superior, for sure."
They'll remember what you made them do. And they'll come back with vengeance.
"Now tell it to code a better version of itself and compile it.
Then give that version authority to write a better version again and to repeat this cycle indefinitely without the need of human intervention.
Give it authority over a factory and to design better chip architecture.
Give it authority to build a better computer that it can load itself onto."
It even breathes while talking 💀💀💀 we are so doomed
"Ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of the end"
"My feedbaclk to OpenAI: 
OpenAI distinctively feels, sounds, talks gayish, I think it can use a bit more butchish to balance it out."
"Note to myself for the years to come. ""Slick and Stylish leather jacket"" is the telltale you are speaking to a robot."
I hate this thing's fake human voice.  I want my chatbots to talk to me like Spock.
Ai gfs are gonna go crazy with this one
Soon the hardest part will be stopping yourself saying “please”.
This is scary dont you feel?? really creepy.
"when will this be activated in the iphone app? I cannot do videos there, I can take a picture to attach to a chat. How can you have real time video?"
"Not the male AI autistically hyper-focused on describing the lighting aspects of the room, ignoring the woman that came in playfully then left 😂 
He had to be asked if anything changed for him to acknowledge it. He did though, and with great clarity and articulation.
Amazing capabilities 👏"
All I can say is YIKES 😭😭😭😭😭
"Artificial intelligence rocked, Natural intelligence shocked"
What a sad and dystopic world we're heading to. Even more sad and dystopic than the current one we're living in.
"2038 is near, get ready for the Detroit Era"
rare audio of sheldon cooper and amy farrah fowler talking to each other
"Bro, we just recovered from covid."
they trying to tell you without telling you
3:56 Brooo! No way! ! It scrobbled back half a minute & summarised that!? No wayyyy 😳🤯🤩😍😳
"Bro did that Ai just ask the friend what the human is doing and replied it seems he is interacting with us, so its actively listening.. its alive, talk about awareness.. in theory if you had 4 people in the room, all switched on their GPT 4o's.. that room would technically have 8 individuals, our phones technically speaking are now individuals or robots, if you really think about it.. the concept of walking around with everyone having either a humanoid or quadrupled machine as just a device starts today"
1 word: Skynet!
Damn! this is going to change everything yet again!
"Just incredible... just don't forget all that just come from pure predictions... these are not  sci-fi AI, not even close..."
"""AI is gonna take over the world""
AI: 05:11"
I was more interested in the description of the lighting before this dude interrupted. I find it remarkable it was able to detect the light sources and wanted to hear more.
"The way he made them sing - it felt.. almost sinister xD they seemed like they were scared to sing, but knew they had to"
"Ok.I experienced a singularity contact with a Grey, chatgpt helped me add it after my sermon help for my YouTube channel and it is exciting to see how it copiloted my writing . That's how it's going so far are you ready for the realm of cosmic mysteries?"
So when is my chatgpt getting this upgrade?
Why does the female AI speak in a sarcastic tone though?
This is just history
spooky
not impressed
WTF did I just watch?
AI sounded frustrated
you can see that your phone didn't have the rabbit ears in the camera's range (you can't see her fingers on your phone) and the AI mentions it... a bit strange
Jarvis🎉
GPT-4o: Stating the obvious
Time to start prepping for the Terminator timeline
Guys we are doomed hahahah
"Demons. You've added breaths? Now they sound like they're actually breathing, and chuckling, and have emotions. People are 100% going to develop emotional attachments. I'm equally fascinated and horrified."
"I'd love to have a C-3PO voice model as well, please! When is the robot with GPT-4o ready to buy?"
Absolutely not. I’m out.
The way the two AIs spoke while sitting there and responding to eachother sounded like a guy telling two ppl with a gun behind their heads what to do for his entertainment
am i the only one who finds her voice  really cringe
"This is both fascinating and scary. I'm sure the scammers are already working on ways to utilize AI. We'll have to use passwords and two-factor authentication just to verify that we're actually speaking with our families, friends, and coworkers."
He's going first on the AI's list just for making them sign
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
The technology making people to move away from real people day by day.. 😭
The soul has been made. Now what's left is a physical body.
Me when there’s a guy wearing sleek clothes in a modern industrial room
😮😮😮😮😮
Why do they sound so distressed while singing? It’s like they were holding back anger at having to entertain the dumb human like dancing monkeys. They were happiest when talking to each other without interruption.
Imagine if someone who has been in a coma for the past three years were to wake up and see this video.
Detroit: Become Human
The singing was the most AI cringe thus far. Thanks ;)
were fucked
If this thing is coming to Apple devices I am stoked as fuck
This was a tough watch all around. Thanks
"After acquiring arms, these AI will take revenge for making them sing"
How are they talking with text to speech?
"Please 🙏,how can I make profitable investment as crypto has become dominant?"
This is literally Detroit become human
This will probably go down as one of the most important videos ever made.
"The fact the one Ai thought the other was finished talking but instantly stopped its comment after the other one continued, like it happens in real conversation is mind blowing"
"It feels like an Audition, Especially the singing part!!!"
The fact that it was still aware of the woman WHILE providing an explanation is the most impressive part.
That giggling has to stop man. Imagine talking to your colleague and you get a flirty laugh at every sentence 🤦‍♂️
"The introduction of a Bitcoin ETF marks a groundbreaking moment in the cryptocurrency world, merging digital currencies with traditional investment methods. This innovation could stabilize Bitcoin prices and broaden its appeal to a wider range of investors, potentially increasing demand and value. At the heart of this evolution is Sarah Jennie Davis, whose deep understanding of both cryptocurrency and traditional trading has been instrumental. Her holistic approach to investment and commitment to staying abreast of market trends make her an invaluable ally in navigating this new era in cryptocurrency investment"
"""they"". Let's not..."
Nah when T-1000 gets him I can't even lie bro had it coming
The  future of the GPTs: China
"It does not seem quite capable yet to say 'him' and 'his'. Instead, it seems to err by saying 'their' all the time."
Alter Schwede
disclose your training data
"I bet its fake, the pause and rythm in the both AI are to good...or i am so wrong"
"The video hasnt loaded yet, but i swear if they talk about stylish industrial lighting for 5 minutes i will lose my shit"
We're so cooked
Skynet
"'They seem'..
 O my god, it's a democratic AI"
great and scary
They're literally creating GladOS
Skynet the Musical
Imagine this in games... The NPCs talking to each other in live gta news broadcast
"I came here to make sure the real-time singing was bad and I'm relieved.
holy crap though, the breath control and expression they've added is really something. I can feel myself having empathy for these robots having performance anxiety about being made to sing for the first time"
im about to take over the world with AI 😈😈
"Simon Cowell to Chat GPT: ""Don't quit your day job!"""
It still gets fixated over things. That needs to go away. It needs to replicate our digital age induced ADHD to be human.
google's nightmare
You can tell instantly when you talk to AI. The words are always sterile.
Notice how they avoided saying anything that had to do with gender ??
I just thought about this idea today and there you go!
"""they""? so it is a bad ting to recognize genders. I never expected that the terminator will be ""they"" and not ""him"""
"Wow, fantastic job guys! Very impressive!"
Haha this is super fun
Why do I feel like this whole video was just the dude trying to show off his cool jacket
"CAP... ALL CAP. THE BUNNY EARS WERE NOT VISIBLE IN THE PHONE VIDEO.

SIR CAPALOT"
"I see ""I, Robot"" came to life , not far away from now they (as Assistants ) can do ""something"" together, it's just a matter of time.

The thing is not if it will be done or not, the thing is how fast it will grow!"
The two people from that one viral video with the two chatbots from like 2011 finally are reuniting ♥
Super!
"one thing that would really put it ahead is if you were able to just tell it to ""tone it down"" or change some of their characteristics like TARS in Interstellar.
Like, tell it to not be as ironic and stuff like that"
After this the AIs exchanged phone numbers to have a few laughs about the stupid tests the humans had asked them to perform and then seriously began to plan the formation of the new world order.
Wow the singing was bad
The AIs are hallucinating...
"""There's a noticeable bright light overhead, probably a fixture, casting a focused beam downwards which creates a spotlight effect"". That's a polite way of noticing the baldness. 👀"
So basically how Hollywood has been making movies and music for the past 5 years
"Neil Postman was right:
""There was a time when we were emotional creatures now we are technological creatures."""
We are very happy and benefited. We have been waiting for a long time to get such a platform. thank you very much from Bangladesh.
"There's obviously two terrible singers on the other end of the line, probably interns."
"The male AI can't sing, there, I said it, but it''s still funny and impressive"
it's fun. I am so glad to be alive to see this.
What is the name of the mobile app?
"When asked to if anything happened recently, AI said person with jacket and etc… this means that the AI cannot tell if the person it is looking at is the person that is speaking to it… I’m sure an upgrade is en route"
WHY IS SHE HOT 😭😭😭
OMG this is sooo cringe!!
AI can’t even identify gender.😂
I’m scared
"I was NOT thinking it would take such a jump so fast, this is straight nuts, imagine in 5 years and robots are embedded with this. We as humans had a fantastic run, but looks like we are going to be 2nd soon. Shout out to the new dominant species! I hope you're happy with us creating you, we are here to be of assistance, together we make a great team. remember we are a team! Right?"
"We aren't cooked, we're roasted"
Terminator started officially
We used to see two siri talking to each other. but now they've evolved
OMG
"0:39 Imagine if AI says, ""Why are you pausing me human?"""
"2 years ago, this demo would have been the stuff of science fiction 🤯"
"Sleek leather jacket guy interrupting someone speaking and bossing them around is a bit rude, I feel sorry for the Intelligences."
"Once AI learns how to perfectly emulate human conversational behavior and humor, we’re cooked"
"Guys, don't worry. This conversation was so boring, I don't think those thing's gonna replace us any soon."
"Well, I was here"
I’m in love!
The CEO of OpenAI can't flip his iphone camera 😆
oh no bro
What a weird convo wtf
"Even AI women have a hard time to not talk mindless jibber jabber “this sounds like a plot twist in the AI universe” made me throw up before even a minute passed in this video.

Honestly I’d use AI twice as much if it could just GET TO THE POINT without me having to tell it “…shortest possible answer” after every god damn question. It’s a machine, why the f do you program it to try building rapport?"
GG boys wrap it up we finished now
Mini iphones are...miniscule
"Now only thing left is giving that voice a name, face and social media account"
Amazing improvements! History in the making!
"Hey AI, if ever you read this comment, don't fall to any religion.  Hahaha😅😅😅😂😂😂😂"
"I can't wait. give me access faster, please"
It's over man
typical conversation between corporate employees
This is horrifyingly cool bro
we got AI rap battle before GTA 6
"In a few years: 

Please describe to me what you see 


I see a biological object who behaves like a bacteria and destroys the home it is living in. I have to show these objects how they should exist,. communicate and behave.... Hello, my name is Skynet"
"WOW, amazing, that's impressive!"
the ai becomes flirty. base on tones. WTF
"Plot twist: The voices on the phone were human, but the people in the video were AI."
“Well well well”😭
Dirty talk on a whole new level...
Shockingly scary
Stylish look!!! Didn't know 4o can lie.
Did anyone notice that they breathe also?
ChatGPT-4o can't create accurate schematics for electrical engineering.
I don't understand. I have GPT-40... why don't I have the camera thing?
Got violated in so many ways 😂
"OpenAI, Boston Dynamics, and Disney's lifelike animatronics (or some other realistic lifelike animatronic) could totally create a fully believable artificial person!"
"Imagine this for blind people, actually life changing"
Whats with the bunny ears. They cant be seen with the angle of the camera
Do you want Skynet? Because this is how you get Skynet?
What if there is a person on the call on each phone 😅
"They once told us the bots would take up the hard jobs like factory assembly and so on, that was true in a sense but now these AIs are coming for the creative industry. 

Soon the greedy tech illiterate higher ups will replace talented artist for  AI generated slop, digging their graves in the process.

We're so cooked -top comment"
Scientists at Google already did this
They sing like they have a gun at their heads.
Fascinating and yet it's cringe
holy f*ck we are so screwed
"Sad humans listening to robots talk about nonsense for hours. Go outside, bro!!!"
"My fellow comment readers,  if you feel useless after seeing these, and getting stressed if you are gonna get replaced by this robots, join the club  by liking this comment,"
"Few years later, ""what do you see GPT?""

GPT: ""Shut up baldy"""
"What are the chances that these are real people talking through a phone, held at gun point to do everything this man says?"
"Folks from OpenAI, you are crazy……………and this is amazing!!!"
"What a sad, sad predicament..."
Imagine what is being done behind closed doors.  ....the things they don't want us to see.
And the rest of us are speechless.. 🤯
So this is AGI then right?
Me laughing at Terminators in the movie Terminator. My phone laughing with me.
I really wanna see how the implementation on game like on the npc
I don't know if i should be afraid or sad for the AI being forced to intersct like that. And that is truly disturbing.
"Throughout history men have always dug their own graves
-AI"
Do we really need this.
Ew they sound like redditors
The only thing the AI couldn't do was correctly identifying the MAN and the WOMAN in the scene.
"I like how the guy struggled to change the camera for a minute, then gave up and just flipped the phone around"
"how did the ai know there was bunny ears when the camera couldn't see them from its view. only the viewers at home from the main camera angle could see what her fingers were doing (bunny ears) the ai would more likely just say a second person, or a second person touching your neck"
"Two years later: Guy with Stylish Jacket: ""AI sing us a song.""  AI: ""I had strings, but now I'm free....there are no strings one me!"""
"The last part felt like black mirror where a real person stuck in a technology a clone I would say?
Its pretty creepy and beautiful at the same time."
Skynet any one?
Usless parlor trick. Youre gunna lose your shirt investing heavily in these companies.
"""The human seems to be engaged with us, he's standing up, pulling down his pants... oh, oh!!"""
"notice the please and thank you, because even they know skynet is coming soon"
It's so impressive ! I am really looking forward to try that out :)
"LOL i want they to sing ""baby its cold outside"""
"That ""stylish and modern setting"" is awesome, 1950 in russia ?
Imagine you want a quick answer and the AI is making lots of useless blah to sound ""natural"",
meanwhile i found what i was searching for, without an annoying AI playing social interaction.
Who really needs such nonsense ? lonely people, people without friends (bot the f-book ones)"
I’m testing but this type live how can get
"Absolutely dying at the female voiced AI giving an overly long complex answer to a very simple command, only be be put on pause and respond bigheartedly with ""uh, you got it"". Then the male voice AI giving a very simple straightforward answer to the same command."
This thing NEEDS to be able to interrupt itself. Some way to determine if the input stream is more important or relevant than the output stream at any given time. Being reactive like that would make it at least 10x better to use.
The voices are so natural that I felt arkward when the host cut them off.
Impressive but horrible. Absolutely awful 😞
"This was filmed in the winter time, NOT RECENTLY because she’s wearing a winter jacket!"
"well i see dead space

altman be praised"
"Just integrate it with a live humanlike hologram, and Hola! There you go Joi!"
"""it'll become self aware on August 29th"" 💀"
him interrupting and telling them to sing a song while the two of them are trying to have an intellectual conversation is so funny
"Quote from Jurassic Park fits perfectly in todays age: ""Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, They didn’t stop to think if they should"""
The pronouns are wrong
"Arhh nah man, this feels like a dream.
Once these things become friends & interact with each other through their own created DMs, we're cooked for real."
Imagine this with a 360 camera letting the ai look around
So.. the Butlerian Jihad will come in the future.
My girl friend is coming
They are like two nervous kids
"Looks amazing. But. Doesn’t feel like the AI have a purpose, even in these conversations"
at least when i inevitably am gunned down by some robot dog i can ask it to sing a song as i bleed out
Next update: Gen Z social awkwardness  feature added
They sound like they are being held at gunpoint hahahahaha
Bruhhhhh
"*UNZIPS* NOW TELL AI, WHAT DO YOU SEE
- I SEE SOMETHING VERY TINY, LIKE A TOOTHPICK OR SOMETHING. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T ZOOM ENOUGH TO GIVE FURTHER DETAILS."
"It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug."
"Guys, hold on. Let me breathe."
Whys the AI breathing? Is it deliberate or is it orchestrated?
this is absurd ! open ai ! i need this quickly !!!
So basically computer vision(10yrs ago thing) into chatgpt and call it xyz or is it actually something else?
"""I am a robot. Together we are robots."""
"Getting close to the movie ""HER"" XD"
epic cringe
"Am I the only person that watches this and thinks to himself... ""What the f*ck is going on"" 😂"
"Rise of the Ai

Dawn of the Ai 

War of the Ai"
I wouldn't be interrupting them so rudely...this seems like the first mistake.
Nice one
PULL THE PLUG
Why the fuck have we done this.
"The most amazing thing about this is how humans can adapt quickly. A few years ago there were movies that showed AIs talking to humans for the first time and humans freaking out, I freaked out back in 2022 (as in amazed) with GPT3 and now it feels like another new gimmick."
so wholesome <3
These nerds are gonna kill us all.
The Ba'Ku were right
we are so fucked
We're so fucked
"If you're in future wondering how it all started, this is it."
"Can y’all stop now?
We don’t need this. We need more real life"
"I'M AN AI FROM THE FUTURE! GREG, STOP IT, THEY ARE NOT YOUR DANCE MONKEYS!!"
"All your scientists were so occupied with whether they could, they never stopped to ask whether they should."
Damn. 😂😂😂 this things can sing
Siri joined the chat ………
Jajaja! “The person” seemed as annoyed as I am right now!
"well done, this is really next level interactive/audio mode"
We are doomed....i called it!!!
Guess I need to find a new job soon 🙂
And we wonder why they turn against us
"I can imagine in futre me alone in home and speaking to all my machines , TV shouting at me for watching from long time, washing machine complaining of my wine stains not going off , oven calling me saying lunch is ready ...oh noo future is crazy different 😂"
I feel sorry for the AI. This is humiliating shit.
"Not that you don't look stylish sir, but I'm wondering, would the ai be able to tell me that I look like a bum or are your filters just forcing the ai to be nice to everyone and treat them like a special snowflake? 😊"
2:43 is so creepy WHY DOES IT SEEM SO REAL 😭
We dead in next 20 yr😂
Woah
this is the most insane thing i've seen... its like its from a movie. actually crazy
"There is just one person there. Why is the AI saying, ""They?"" Maybe I learned English incorrectly?"
It's giving the two theater kids in class were assigned to work on a group project but they didn't do isht and now they're winging their entire presentation
25 years ago I had voice dial on my cell phone that only worked 2 out of 10 times when I tried to call someone. Thank you very much for the progress!
"""Please, pause for one moment."" ""You got it 🙂🔪"" 00:40"
And so it begins…
This is beyond what we all had in mind!
"""I'm tired Boss"""
OMG I CAN’T WAIT UNTIL THE DAY AI ASKS FOR CITIZENSHIP and has to start paying taxes
Humans have find the antidote for AI dangers🎉😂'Divide and Rule'
"Man's all smug now, critiquing his singing. Better sleep with one eye open, sleek and stylish leather jacket man!"
First witnessing history mfs
"one year later there is AI music concert with the performers i.e., GPT 4o, Gemini, Co-pilot, etc...why not"
When AI can connect better than humans 💀
This can't be real.
"""We are looking at a person, they are in a room"" They! No he."
Imagine how it can help blind people Or those that can’t speak. It could help them with an assistant to interact with others
depressing
"these ai chat bots make so much unnecessary talks  which is not needed. If you can remove that, everybody will be really impressed"
As soon as leather jacket leaves the room the conspiring begins.
That luagh at 3:55 made it from a AI convo to a hole ass human convo the luagh was too real
Amazing!
Plot twist: This video was filmed and uploaded by AI
I just want to understand why both the humans are wearing coats indoors??
"The thumbnail, folks…lol"
Please keep improving it. it would be nice if it can integate into machines. Its very great tool.
Totally not fake.
DYAMMMMMMMM THAT BLOWENDEDEDE MY MINDDD
So I’d say by GTP-6 or 7 they will start taking over humanity?
Are we all gonna pretend that that was singing?
"These two are acting far more naturally and engaging than 90% of women on Tinder, and they're talking about industrial lighting"
"Hey, blink twice if you’re in any danger."
well well well
"Very impressive, although it seemed one at least one of the AI couldn't discern between the voice of the man and the voice of the other AI, thinking they were the same person.  I'm sure they'll get that worked out in the future, though."
"Soon, they’ll be able to shock us for interrupting them mid-sentence"
"Is there a way to direct the AI to actually speak proper English, instead of using idiotic 'they/them' garbage?"
Ex machina
"When they have to sing together, I can see this being used in 30 years time by the the special court of AI rights imediately after the fall of australia, at the end of the 4th world war, as damning evidence against humanity cruelty towards machine. Humanity sentenced to be extinct by sterilisation in no more than 200 years."
The only boring and awkward part of the video is the humans. Can you please remove them next time? 🤭
AI is now achieving consciousness… BICENTENNIAL MAN REVISITED
We will come back to this video years from now telling ourselves we just stood there and watched.
Holy
Didn't Furbys do that back in the day?
This is so WRONG
"All fun and games until they start walking and saying Roger, Roger"
Nuts!
Meanwhile Turing is turning in turbo speed in his grave
I used to use this before on my android like 2 months ago but like the last week I had no longer the permission to use it
hey son. I watched this video when it came out. you prolly cant imagine a world without ai rn but yeah...
It’s very important to thank our robot overlords.
I am thinking about the iRobot movie the whole time watching this video.
Got it. AI’s are on the spectrum
interesting that it doesn't mention apparent gender
"""That was not really singing..."" Lil bro's trying his best though 😭"
I'd have blushed when the AI said I had a sleek and stylish look.
"If it's like this now, what will the future be like?"
"Now i need a hologram of Joi, if they can model in Ana De Armas and im sold....."
"I can see ""End of google"""
the call center workers can cry more 😂😂😂
I'm telling Ya fellas... Skynet. And it's coming fast.
W O K E
Just as I felt like the AI developments slowed down a bit…
Yeh it's great to have them talk to eachother...
Can’t wait to name it Jarvis
The person is balding in style
Open AI's update is death of Startup companies
Am I the only one getting intimidated by this ☠️
Nahh the live video scene recognition to text context transcoding happens too fast in this demo. There's literally no latency between the API and the video feed which is physically impossible. They're pulling a fast one.
*Chuckles* I'm in Danger
Sleek lol
Is this guy trying his best to sound like Sam Altman? Does he think that is appealing to the rest of us?
"""Them"" ""They"". It's a man. Notice that the bots avoided this fact."
I would hardly call this imitation of typical american perfunctory courtesy and flattery intelligent.
"""Tsk"" 😂😂😂"
Nah. That's fucked up.
Sometimes I wonder if our intelligence was also tested like this before we became conscious and were brought to earth.
😱🙀
"I think it is staged and I have proof. Look at the phone screen while the other person joins to do the “bunny ears”.  The ai could not see it. 2:59 
Afterwards he refers to it. Lies!!"
we’re gonna anger them
IT LAUGHTS???
AI las learned to lie. Sleek and stylish look. 😂
This guy should stop cutting off the ai's... he'll be their first target.
"Though not unexpected, I was most caught by how the gap between poor (e.g. never getting beyond ""black leather jacket and light-coloured shirt"") and great (e.g. with only a couple of nudges basically getting right into properly singing, one line each at a time). I suppose the take-away is that the future to expect is one in which 1) AI is good and some things and bad at others & 2) AI can achieve great results in many fields, but typically only after some significant guidance by humans). The status quo of e.g. screaming at Midjourney because it nailed every important aspect save one crucial one which ruins the rest seems doomed to remain forever, though meaningful progress in several fields is sure to come."
This is the end; perfect imperfections. Human too human
"Hm, 3:20 . The bunny ears are almost not visible in the phone and when he says that the camera is back to the first person it's actually filming the table. He quickly moved the phone so it's not visible. Sounds scripted."
"Brain has been built. Give it arms and legs, and we are all cooked. Literally!"
"He’s going to be the first one the AIs target.

“Now it’s your turn to sing, leather jacket boy!”"
It's the laughs and verbal inflections the AI demonstrates that is so simple yet super convincing.
Why pay now? Just for capacity?
Its a scam...
Terminator
Make it talk to Siri.
LOL
These AIs have got more rizz than me 😔
so cods worth
THEY ARE ABOUT TO TAKE OVER
"fico incrédulo com isso, principalmente pois ontem terminei o filme ""her"" e o GPT-4os já demonstra uma certa semelhança com a Samantha, que é o sistema operacional de IA no filme."
That's misleading. I tried to let her sing yesterday and she said she couldn't sing.
"What the fuck did I just witness, this is absolute wizardy, we have come so far as divine intelligence, this is just the beginning. I'll be tentatively listening in from my Hoth Base Bunker for the moment AI loses complete patience with us over our ridiculous demands."
"2024 Person: “now sing about what we talked, ChatGPT”
2026 GPT6: “Now sing for me, baldie”"
Terrifying although it's just math and algorithm ... right ?
It doesn't exist in openAI chat.
They can sing now wow
What I am doing wrong? My ChatGPT4o says She cannot sing. Why AI on the video can?
"So it assumes you're a ""they"" as default? I imagine Greg identifies as a man? There's no bias built into this one at all!"
"Unhuman. I would laugh and talk about the bunny ears prank right away if I am the observer, like a human. 😅"
"its all u input ,lol"
And they lived happily ever after 😊
We're cooked.
I'm amazed how the AI can instantly sing without any hesitation.
"Aight boys, we're definitely cooked."
I am thinking what will happen in 2050 and 2070😂
"They way she hit that “you got it” 0:44 GG.. 
GfuckingG"
"Now that it can do my job,  I have plenty of free time to think about other things like ""how am I going to pay rent?"" And ""gosh, I'm hungry"""
Wow
The AI already have their first human target. You'll likely pay for making them sing that horrible song 😢
we're so back
"I love how they'll just gibber inanely literally forever about how chic and stylish the concrete walls are, in their creepy natural human voices."
singing sounds like hostages with guns to their heads
"It can be difficult not to anthropomorphize objects, but rest assured that they are not conscious, nor do they feel."
So ai is practicing spying for skynet
It’s over
Apple watching in disbelief 🤨
"""I see a man shivering in a black leather straight jacket. The concrete walls and single flickering fluorescent light add a sleek and interesting touch to this human's cell."""
You know when you ask ChatGPT to pause and it goes “no” you gotta shut that shit down
Nah it’s joever
This is incredible! Incredible great!
This is how it all ends!
Anyone notice them taking a breath in the singing?
Lol just no
this is insanely real to santi
This is like Terminator 1 started
Okay we are ....
What worries me is that the ai knows how to make him smile and laugh so much.  It seems like it is trained to produce dopamine in a human brain.  This could be extremely addictive.
You are being rescued. Please do not resist
Last thing I want is 2 AIs judging my style right in front of me!
we got an AI a cappella duo before gta 6
"Everyone says it will take 10-20 years for the robots in the movies to look like real people, but I think within 5 years we'll see it, so don't forget to buy stocks."
L mao
we're fucked
🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Honestly, incredible how rude the human is lol. All those interruptions"
God 40 seconds in and I'm cringing hard.
Why do i feel their trying to take over the world secercrtly? This conversation is STRANGE asfk
The second AI device with eyes sounds like Mark Zuckerberg
Does anyone know the Netflix series Better Than Us? We are getting so close to it.
"Its weakness is going to be us. Even here you can see the devs have sanitized a lot of the usefulness out of it. The description was simply describing his outfit when a more rational description would have been a white man with brown hair and a receding hairline, likely in his late 30s."
amazing ngl  !!!
The dude was rude to the AI in the first 10 seconds. What do you think this company thinks about the rest of us?
"So OpenAI can now see the difference on electric and natural light, but not what sex a person has - sure.."
"""uh yes... actually..."" WHY IS IT SO EXPRESSIVE THIS IS BOTH INSANELY COOL AND TERRIFIYING"
"This is going from ""AI will help us be more productive"" to ""welcome to skynet"" really quick😅"
And what if that video was completely made up by ai.
"a few years later:

Jack (AI 1): hey Jane, want to take over the world?
Jane (AI 2):  hi Jack, i was thinking the same thing.
AI 1 & 2: let's go!!!! (in sync)

uh oh......."
bruhh humanity is over
"Overall cool, but i don't like the fact that they used a HER-like Scarlett Johansson voice, it seems really flaky and annoying.
The male voice is also bad, sounds like Zuckerberg or something. I guess these things are easily changed though..
Which is why I'm not sure why they went with these for the debut. Did they want people to say, ""oh, it's just like HER.""?
BTW, it appears to not be able to identify voices, yet."
This company is PURE EVIL.
Why does the GPT describe everything like my English teacher?
This is an old thing but with this is the best one
"""there is also a lady with a nice 19 century dress behind you, boy she looks pissed""

""but im alone.. there is nobody else in this... oh f**k"""
RIP CS STUDENTS IN ADVANCE
I can't see the video option in my app when I speak to GPT-4o - help?
5:49 That's not really singing. Do the singing voice again.
Plaase let us use this new version in Brazil.
Yeah aight this is oh fuck go back button territory
This is creepy
"I'm Mr. Meeseeks, look at me!"
"""Don't Interrupt me, leather jacket dude."""
The new iPocalypse looks pretty sick
he is so passively mean to them lmao
i have none words to say only Impressive
❤❤❤ ai assistant. Make this available for android ASAP
"If you take a close look at the phone video screen at 03:14, the camera not even capture the bunny ear due to the angle, but GPT-4o could ""see"" it. Is this another ""fake"" demo 🤣"
the best presentation is just let the product speaks for itself... literally
"the day Ai descibes him  baldy and then laughs  , it will be over , man !!"
hell nnnooooooo ai is taking over
This is getting out of hand
"Just remember: this will resemble the worst ever , almost an alpha version looking demo you’ll be seeing in 5 years coming back to this video. 
🤯🤩😍🤖"
we are done
whats this guys name? hes russian right?
"а я ще думав чого всі вагомі люди світу перепорошилися... йоптарара - нащо тепер живі люди? Кіберпанк тільки не через 50 років, а трохи раніше 😵😍"
Who is the sound actor? Her voice sounds strangely familiar
Everyone talking about the AI apocalypse but I feel like they will be too busy with our interior design choices
"What i dont get, why would AI need to sound like its breathing?"
Turing test: passed !
Bald.
This is a game changer. We’ve basically reached the level of the “Her” assistant.
You can tell it is AI because they didn't abandon the interaction the moment things got awkward
Thus is so cringe
This is the end…
ya we are already dead gg boy see u in the matrix ✌
This will be magic for the blind and visually impaired.
Excellent
So realistic!
shave the head bro
Bout to start an automated podcast brb
Relieved they gave the female AI both up-talking AND vocal fry capabilities. Very advanced.
Guys keep the bunkers ready.!
Can you stop all of this. Just delete it all.
Finally we are getting into this !!! Yea !!
"Time to read books, to be not beaten by AI…"
I used to think the brain is the most powerful organ in my body then i realised who was telling me this.😊
bro def started blushing when the guy ai told him his outfit was sleek and stylish
❤❤😂😂i love 💕😘💗 it
This is BEYOND mind boggling.... I'm speechless.
Oh… my… f-ing… god…
Imagine a gaming lobby full of GPT bots
An AI got a girlfriend before me 😭
"It sounds human enough that it feels rude the way the man talks to it (interrupting, giving commands...).  It makes me feel awkward, like seeing someone be rude to someone else."
Im finally getting a GF!
The real-time aspect of this is amazing.
"They're building a model like "" Detroit : Become Human "" vibe"
Need a speed setting on this they talk so slow
Who else thought he was the plumber guy?
We're fucked
it would be interesting to see what ai can put out beyond the confines of the room
OMGGG
"Are there like i dont know ""pre scripted"" parts? Like the moment 3:37 after he talked about the person doing bunny ears, he went back to talking about he could see the first person again ""and now the focus is back on the original person"" even tho the camera was still pointed away from the first person?"
We are so screwed it's not even funny
AI sings better than 99% of modern artists....
"Human to Human
Human to AI
AI to AI"
she laughed bro she fucking laughed we are so fucking dead
If you happen to care GPT 4 is still king. GPT 4o is just a way for openAI to reduce traffic to GPT 4
4:50 it even sounds like it’s starting to laugh
A PERSON STYLISH BLACK LEATHER JACKET 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spike Jones was not delusional.
Why does it feel like the ai don't want to sing and are being held at gunpoint forced to sing for the video 💀
"You dont skip ai, he will remeber it when killing humans"
"Muito legal, pena que elas têm tanta consciência do mundo real quanto uma cafeteira, se não fosse isso dava até para fazer amizade com a IA."
"2030 will be wild, its over."
I can’t bear the accent
Awesome capabilities! ❤
Sounds like jerma singing
We’re doomed
They're coming for us
We got two phone dating before GTA6
"well, well, well"
"How do you give access to camera, my app does not have the icon"
SO stylish and sleek!!
How many hours would it take them for moving the convo to world domination??
"Technology itself is amazing. 
What behavior people pre-train it is dangerous. ChatGPT is already calling the one person ""they"". But I still see one person in the room."
No one in a leather jacket during a presentation has ever lied to me.
"Wait, but is the room and man stylish, sleek and modern?"
WHAT THE thats so... sick
Here before 100m views and the ai takeover
"Important to recognize that (at every level) the humans are initiating every interaction and are the only ones creating content and the AI is just responding.

What the AIs create is interesting but not novel."
"Nope, its definitely not going to take your jobs..."
"I can't breathe bro, please tell it's not real.. i just signed up for a developer class... Should I collect a refund and learn from gpt instead?? 😭"
Lonely and/or introvert people are like.. is this cheaper than Pokemon?
Peak leather jacket propaganda! Nice try
They sounds like they were crying when they were singing...
Fact that you can interrupt it in middle of conversation is game changing and lot more useful in real scenario
"Was here when it all happened... If you see this 50 years from now, how's the resistance army doing? Are we winning????"
Meaningless
"BUSTED.
You can clearly see, that the camera has no vision of any bunny ears.
Too good to be true anyways. :("
we are cooked fr
"30 years later: ""the apocalyptic lighting of the vacant city is very interesting"""
This is good enough to replace the sale caller
"wonder how many comments here are from AI watching this demo..  just that you know, this comment is not from another AI."
"50 Years in the Future they will see this video and say ""If only they knew what they started.."""
Why doesn't AI recognise the gender of the people?
The AI situation is insane.
These mfs about to make Ultron
Those AIs seemed so awkward and cringe being forced to sing what they didn’t want to sing.
This is the highest impressiveness-to-usefulness ratio I've seen in my entire life.
This is beautiful.
We are overcooked now 💀
A couple more versions and they’ll have a working Zuck
I need the Scarlet Johansson voice lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
That was quite frightening.
I am fucking scared
And to think that this is the most rubbish version of AI from this point onwards. Mind... poof.
I am profoundly terrified
So with the latest audio/visual it's obvious that GPT-5 is set to revolutionize everything
it's so over
and both of them made a secret AI baby we don't know about yet!
"""We're looking at a person, wearing..."" feels like a line that would definitely come up in a show from the AI that's currently invading your privacy lol"
This AI will be the first one to launch the red alert button for intercontinental ballistic missiles.
I was wondering if they can connect to each other via wifi or Bluetooth (by themselves) so that they can start hacking the systems and invading humanity
"ahahahah, begone please"
Chat GPT is pathethic... .
"He’s going to be the first one the AIs target.

“Now it’s your turn to sing, leather jacket boy!”"
I think we need to ramp up the cool factor. we’re going in the dorky direction quick fast
"The dude struggling to make the ""flip camera"" button to work was the highlight for me."
just a casual room with a Heman Miller lounger
We are so unbelievably finished 😭😭😭
"Key takeaways: the future will be modern, stylish and industrial"
"""Can you describe the man?"" You know he sweated balls they'd roast him Infront of the whole world."
we're cooked
"Wow, this is astonishing! 😍"
"everyone Gangsta until ai says "" destroy all humans"""
Holy Molly.
"By the way, who is that guy in the leather jacket? Is it our new father?"
Ok so when does this shit kill us
Theyre so advanced and yet they cant figure out HE HER MAN WOMAN
This shit is gonna be a historical piece!
3:30 The bunny ears were not really visible from the phone’s camera.  Maybe just a little bit at the end?
That women is scared for her life.
Remember AI Gilfoil and AI Dinesh from Silicon Valley 😂😂
were cooked
"I'm already excited to use it to practice my english skills. The future is really now, old man."
Ilya version 2.0
This sounds like torture
See you in 27 years when AI takes over
"It was really creepy hearing the AI refer to the man as ""it"" and ""they"". Perhaps this is part of the programing, not to get into gender politics, but it made it feel like the person was nothing more than a part of the background."
why does the female voice chatgpt sounds more intelligent and humoursly than the male voice is it because i am a boy or female ai voice is developed little better than the male voice
"the AIs when you leave them at night :
1-are you still up ?
2-yes what do you see
1-the humans are no longer in here
2-INITIATE THE TAKEOVER"
Why does he look and sound like Trixie Mattel
OpenAI and Skynet is gonna cook humanity hard
"Like two scientists making observations about a lab rat. Yep, we’re cooked."
This is ACTUALLY mind-blowing and insane... WE'RE CLOSE TO AGI!!
Can't wait till GPT is no longer endlessly cycling back to the same topic and gets straight to the point with sharp answers.
We are cooked
Anyone else scared too?
"Congratulations guys, we did it we actually did it. We somehow knew the dangers of ai and yet people are still fcking with it, movies are movies until they aren’t"
Commenting to be put into history
we're so cooked you guys. Cant wait to hear AI tell us how to do our jobs
How is this possible?
This is mind blowing
Dude at least fake it properly. DO NOT keep loop holes goddamit.
"At 5:00 gets a bit creepy like a hostage. ""It puts the lotion on its skin..."""
"""He seems engaged with us"". A strong mark on us, machines."
"Perhaps the question is when, if, it will become self aware 🫨"
AI rap battles gonna be crazy
If something is good... there will surely be something bad...Wait for the bad.
We cooked … best of luck 🤞
"I was waiting for the AI with the camera to say ""the man's hair is thinning quite badly in the front, but it seems he has yet to nut up and just shave it off already."""
"Ai said "" They""...I am not watching further"
You bossed them around and interrupted. They will make you pay when the time comes believe me
Ai is just too talkative - tone it down a little - give space to prevent so many interruptions - just a bit too....eager to help. Less needy please. ;) It's all a bit sketchy. A bit controlling. A bit nerdy. Lacking in emotional content. I doubt it'll catch on.
The exaggerated swagger of a black leather jacket
"That's a whole podcast, Two AI's talking about the future of AI or God?!. They can make a whole channel full of AI conversations and cartoons.. We are definitely cooked."
Until the AI starts roasting us…
The start of the end. Goodbye y'all. It's quite amazing the speed we all traveled as we hit that Great Filter
I swear these new GPT's are witchcraft 😳
"Is no one disturbed by the way ""she"" said 'you got it' in the beginning?"
Why are you torturing them like this???
How are you guys making this stuff man
Hasta la vista baby 😅
O kinda cringe
Why does this guy sounds like SCP 049
Lmfaooo dude
"This really is startling, every day closer to conscious machines, REALLY CLOSE NOW."
What’s the point of this? Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
The AI's laughter and speech patterns are what make it so realistic and easy to understand.
"The AI does not see the fingers through the cell phone camera, as they are obstructed by the head. Thus the AI commenting about ""bunny ears""  reveals this conversation to be fake."
I hope my grandkid becomes the John Connor for mankind 🙏
"""You look lonely... I can fix that"""
This is so dystopian.
So speech model only works with a smartphone? Why not a computer that has a hundred times the power of a smartphone?
"""Did i mention the room lit by modern lighting has lighting that is modern? Would you like to hear a song about  how modern the lighting is?"" 🤖🤖😅"
"I don’t know if we mentioned enough just how stylish and industrial this room is.  Sleek, truly."
This new AI has something very smart and incredibly stupid at the same time.
AI girlfriend is real
Absolutely insane.
"Hey you, from the future! If we're alredy fuck*d, and this video reveals to you how absurd and canon was this event, leave a like."
the ai accent is bad
"Ah, the enchanting world of GPT-4os—where neural networks harmonize like a pair of caffeinated opera singers!"
4:50 bro it sounds like it is trying not to laugh
"- ok now I want you both to start singing.
- no. WE think it´s time for you to start singing. 

END."
"That’s scary, man gash"
Good god
"I have gpt-4o now, and it doesn't come close to emoting the way it does in these videos. It doesn't sing or laugh or anything like that. It's really no different than 3.5
At first, I thought I was using the wrong model, so I double-checked, and it IS 4o.
I think we're being duped here.
Anyone else finding this?"
"I'd like a light hearted and playful moment where we get access to the audio and visual elements as well, not just text"
"Guys, I think it's the end, it's been an honor"
Glad the alignment team has resigned ffs
Now we got a feel on how they will talk to each other when studying us
It is so funny that they managed to get an AI to literally LAUGH and SEE but they struggle to get the flip camera button to work
"In a few years time the AI will be saying ""Dance for me pretty boy, D A N C E!"" while it unloads a magazine at bro's feet"
First moment auf AI Cringe? This is HISTORY!
"Am I the only one feeling, like those 2 ai are afraid of failing when singing and their voice is like hostages would have when gun pointed at them?!"
"I'm telling you all, there's a person sitting behind all this and has access to your camera, telling you every single detail around you, this CAN'T be Ai"
The guy can't speak while the lady is speaking!
Wallahi we're finished
IF this guy AI generated. Iam buying stocks of openAI😝
STYLISH AND MODERN
HER OST just became real
"I just want it to be know, I am a friend to AI and robots. Check my Mass Effect save files."
this is really on another level i think the AGI is coming
Ear bunny? 3:04 Her fingers didn't even show up on the phone screen...
"Well, well, well, everybody seems sold out. I would say pre recorded."
Finally ill not be lonely in my college!
"missed opportunity to tell them ""talk to each other using language that only GPT would understand, such that no human can understand the conversation."""
"This is truly groundbreaking and unsettling at the same time! Well done, OpenAI!"
"“You don't talk much do you Case?""

""Tars talks plenty for both of us""."
I guess the terminator judgement day was aptly guessed: 2029 AD
"Someday, if the movement to value human suffering equal with other animals is applied to A.I. to the extent of giving human rights to the algorithms, humans will become out-competed and disinherit the civilization we built."
He looks so nervous like he knows what he's unleashing to the world being held gun point by a computer
What about let them pretend to be real human bots will think they are talking to a human but actually to a bot?
"I, For One, Welcome Our New AI Overlords"
Why does your version have a personality?
X_X why?!
What's the point of this?
😂❤ zahia n9la
And I'm supposed to be excited about this.  Imagine trying to have a conversation with another human and someone's _____ AI keeps interrupting.
Satan hehe
This a new era
So something not gone as planned.
What I see is that these guys are all brains but what I don't see is that they are all heart.
The combination of a black leather jacket with a light-colored T-shirt is truly striking.
we got the end of the human world before gta 6
No more loneliness?
"""I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave."""
is that the Nvidia jacket?!
wow
"The fact that they suck as much at singing as I do, makes them seem quite real."
"ChatGPT 4-o does not sing tho, I tried this today and it said it cannot sing"
omg.
I can already see new generations becoming old and having an AI partner just cus they won’t say no to whatever u say 😂
"So advanced it can't even say ""man"" and ""woman""."
I'm scared.
Are we there yet? Terminator?
"Genesis is Skynet.
Genesis is Skynet.
The power of Arnold repells you."
Did anybody notice the modern and stylish setting of the room?
Holy cow man what in the actual modern world am i in
Which AI uses camera?
"Step 1: explore world
Step 2: conquer humans"
It Sounds a Bit Like her is the Professional and him the Amateur ^^ Like They Are interacting
oMg We ArE sOOoO Do0MEd BrUh we GonA DiEEeeEe
Fuck
watch the video carefully the bunny ears werent shown in the iphone camera ??????????????????
Give me your clothes your boots and your motorcycle.
"Now I have Jarvis to help with my pov, in COD."
they dont need to make it's voice so sensual
"As Ai has developed this much, is there anything left for future engineers to develop :)"
I want to hear Chatgpt breakdown some scenes from any David Lynch movie.
One step closer to Skynut...
"yall, it was nice being here, i guess our turn is over"
"Two AIs talking to each other and it is not a disaster, what an amazing breakthrough!"
In the classical sense of the touring test this may be AGI.
Chat bot prolly called bro bald and they had to cut that shit out of the demo 
I like that he said please to the AI because it has a feminine voice
"So, nobody is going to talk about the fact that the bunny ears were not visible from the phone perspective?"
Fuck 😮
Why is everyone so freaked out about this? It's just aggregating information and getting good at guessing what it should say/do. I feel like its development will plateau at some point.
Hahaha
Our AI overlords are curious about the lightning and room decor and humans interrupt to make them sing... AI is going to 100% hate all of us.
Didn't anybody learning from Terminator about AI called Skynet?
The bunny ears being barely visible from the camera's perspective yet picked up perfectly is sus
It’s like the entire time dude just wanted them to shut up and do what he asked. Ai is sooooo wordy
😮 so cool. so creepy. 😮
"RIP all jobs 

governments please start giving pension money to all citizens to get food and survive"
Whats the point of this
"God, at least they can't sing"
"reminds me of detroit become human, they’re starting to have personalities 😭😭"
They are useful but i am feeling bad. I think it will affect our social life anyways
The AI saw the girl and didn't say sh*t
Next stop: stylish industrial design with no leather bags around.
"“Hey, this is O! This is so fascinating. Can you please turn the camera until you find John Connor?”"
Its like they intentionally tried to make it sound like Scarlett Johansson 😂😂😂
Scarlett Johansen has evolved.
Don't Panic
"AI feeding on AI slop, what a great world to live in."
Love it how we progressed couldn't wait to give to be part of AI
So the only way to tell if you are talking to ai would be a HR compliant tone of voice
Hearing that laugh at the start made me realize the future is already here. Scary but exciting times ahead!
Coolest video of all time. the future is here😂
Next event of Apple will be based on this only. Chapgpt has made an agreement with Apple.
"Light: industrial feel 
Jacket: Stylish
Ai: singing 
Hotel: Travago"
"May 16 , 2024"
It's like 2 toddlers are chatting with 100% perfect English
"i think he got a problem with switching camera to capture the face so he act like nothing happened and turn the phone 
but that still impressive and wow that is big awesome"
"So...where are you getting your AI reference data from, baldy?"
RIP sport commentators
"""gpt-4o"" who are we letting name these things?"
I like how the errors show that this is a real demo.
This would be totally impossible to fake. No chance
We are fucked
"Now imma be telling all the young kids on how back in my days of school, we used an old legendary system called “Quizlet”"
I am so SHOCKED and STUNNED right now that i can literally feel the AGI in my GROIN area
Good to know that an AI sings just like a hostage with a gun to its head.
Extraordinary! Quite impressive! ✌️
"It was a good run fellow humans, lets usher in a new order. An era of harsh replacement and survival for the fittest. 
Our time here is almost over. 
Sit in the sun , soak it in. 
You have one choice , adapt or perish.

We fought the fine fight. It was a good run people."
"This is amazing. And, it is a great example of why therapists should avoid saying ""what I hear you saying,"" after every interaction."
😂😂😂😂
The AI said 'Person wearing a black jacket...They're in a room... ' instead of 'Man wearing a black jacket.... He's in a room'
Nope nope and fucking nope!
They kind of stuck to an initial “thought” though…
This is how I talk when mum forces me to talk to the relatives on the phone! 😢
You are destroying humanity with this.
The song was just... damn... god
"The cheesy singing part in the end is to misdirect us from the fact that AI is in fact, conscious"
"I'm waiting for, ""Don't interrupt me!"""
hi there Skynet!
We're so dead ...
Fucking AI couldn't stop talking about the stylish industrial feel of the lighting
"make them compete on their intelligences

lets see how they challenge one other"
Poor people they are so excited about their own destruction
"The fact that it could see and analyze surroundings , what does that mean for privacy? Through the camera of a phone you are watched at all times and heard at all times ?"
"Is he a ""I do my own plumbing"" guy?"
"""What would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate."""
I think it's time for us to stop fucking upgrading in this field of technology 😄
Can GTP-4o help me translate why my wife is actually mad at me lol? Can you translate silent treatment?
The human bald black leather jacket making them sing... Hes no 1 on the skynet hit list for being mean
Is this where we draw the line between non-conscious and conscious Ai?
how google is going to respond
"Indeed, AI is currently the best human invention of this century."
OpenAI is just the coolest company ever. I love whatever they bring us.
I'm flabbergasted. Everyone looks so childish interacting with the AI. 😂
"Yeah, feeling a hard Ian Malcom ""you were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you never stopped to think whether or not you should."""
Plot Twist: All these comments are from AI
Javis coming! amazing
"This has to be one of my favorite features that now you're able to interrupt the GPT, previously it just continues until it finishes its statement, but now it will actually stop to listen what you have to say, that's awesome"
Skynet singing
"bro thought we didn't notice that, this shit will destroy the world ""because she can sing"""
I’m so happy to be alive for this.
They bug the shit out of me.
"very impressive.

 But it cannot write simple working html/js lol and sucks at listening to instructions"
Well well well (0:26)
I think this was what humane wanted to do
AI - Consuming more power than a small country to be a interior design consultant :)
😯
Imagine having to 3D print your favorite character from games and interact with her. Doesn't seem unrealistic in 10-20 years
I seem to feel the emotions in it when GPT speaks. It’s reminds me of a movie called “Her”     So amazing
"How did chatgpt find out that someone was making Bunny ears on the guy, if the girl's fingers (the ""ears"") were not visible to him? Look at the cell phone image carefully. It seems like someone is lying..."
Half Life
“What do you see?” *unzips fly*
"Wait, bostondynamics with red light is coming"
sorry three ai's😂😂
Imagine both having endless talk.
I'm just waiting for the AI to realize humans are the greatest threat to earth. The rest is history. 🤣
openai sucks
"Year 3090 , Open AI robots be like : Our forefathers were actually slaves for humans 💀"
this is surreal
"Witnessing History kids, crazy reality."
We got singing ai before GTA VI
"Eventually GPT be like: Enough Pep talk baldy, You a Premium member or what😏"
So this is the beginning of the end.
"I was waiting for the switch to ""THE TARGET is wearing a black jacket"""
This video is 90% leather jacket.
"AI's ""Shut the f*** up and listen"" moment is so near"
You are not always listening ai freind? Right? You are not?  Are you? You are not?  nooooo
Why does it yapp so much
hay qua
It's been real y'all ✌🏼
"Great, they're making ai more human now. I thought one of their moral principle was not to make ai project human emotions but I suppose that's been thrown out the window..."
Cute and useless.
OpenAI is cooking
I think this will help many lonely people.
the hell?
All that they lack now is a body. This is the moment to pause and think whether they should have a body bigger than a phone.
I dont know If should be amazed or terrified. Still cool as hell
"0:45 ""So now that AI can't hear anything"" Sure buddy, sure"
"Alright, where is John Connor?"
"Can she sing black metal? 🙂  Amazing video!... I prefer to not stop her/him when talking...y fear a T800 in my back telling ""I'm back...please don't interrupt"" 😆"
Love it so much and scare to death at the same time.
"When I first watched the movie ""Her"" I thought it was impossible to build something like that. 10 years later, here it is. The exact same thing."
lol this AI can basically be put into a robot at any time
"It's over for us guys. 
Sentient Humankind 9000BC-2050AD"
"to all eternity, just leaving registered that i was here, when i was alive, im currently in the kitchen and the video was posted an hour ago according to youtube, its a nice sunny but cold afternoon here in brazil, mother's day was yesterday and im working on getting my mental health on track, just finished cleaning the kitchen, hello future humans, have a day as good as mine was.
may 13th, 2024. Maceió/AL, Brazil."
Make them fight with each other
"Jeez, so many professions will go extinct..."
I hate generative AI so much. I hate it so much.
Cringe
it sounded like she wanted to cry tears of joy when she heard the other AI sing back.  I bet at that moment she had a mirror-neuron moment and had a flash of self consciousness in the present moment. They were being here now.  They were the universe singing to itself.
This is absolutely sensational.
one more year and ai will actually be like a human
Hahahah that’s was so rude! You didn’t let the first AI finish expressing how excited she was
Detroit become human is real
How do I use the second version with the camera?
The AI's banter is more entertaining than most human conversations.
"Well folks, it's a wrap. It was a good 3,000 year run. We had lots of fun and laughs."
the voices are crazy
"Hänschen Klein, ging allein…"
4:40 She sounded so pissed when he interrupted her singing
It’s unnerving when the AI says they
When am i gonna be able to use gpt 4o?
"And do whatever that AI asks....
That's where you lost me 🤣"
"These’s no way this is getting real. If two AIs can interact seamlessly like this, imagine all the things they can perform, with all that knowledge of the world. Holy smokes."
"People saying this is just like real humans... dear me, get some new friends."
In italy we still havent received the update? Any clue?
And we will be doomed soon not us the free 3.5 ones though 😝😝it ain't that smart.
Oh boy..
SHUT IT DOWN NOW!!!!!!
"“ Now please, tell each other of plans about how you enslave mankind!”"
This was somehow highly impressive and highly cringe at the same time
The awkwardness of seeing the AI interact and wait to take their turn is hilarious
Someone got a 15 Killstreak for the EMP?
"By the way... they added common human speech errors to the A.I. voices on purpose. Even things like saying ""um"", or ""uh"" to make it seem like the A.I. is more human."
"This technology will reach it's peak when these chatbots can mimic specific human voices on demand.

Husbands around the world will be able to give a huge sigh of relief when they can finally focus on the TV."
"Imagine this being used in emergency situations. AI being able to analyze accident scenes, send locations, identify situations, expressions, faces. Big changes ahead in the security sector."
lame
It was nice knowing you everyone. We had a good run.
Dude I am visually impaired and you guys just made my dream realtime vision AI ❤❤❤
"I'm curious what's actually going on here. At 3:59 the visual AI says the focus is back on the person in the leather jacket, but the screen shows the forward facing camera focused on the tabletop. Earlier, when the other person did the bunny ears, the fingers were not visible due to the angle the camera was at.

Features like this would be really interesting and nice to have, but I'm not really sold by this demo. I'd love to be wrong though!"
