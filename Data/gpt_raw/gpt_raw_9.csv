"She seems phony, trying to be too cheerful while plotting our demise."
I got this feeling when watching their unveil video
For some reason people didn’t realize the her voice is “sky” and has been there the entire time just not with the emotional booster of 4o
I don’t think the vocalizations are made by ai.. just feeding ai results through voice making software
woke ai 😂
Glorified search engine its crap
The positivity is pretty extreme and overbearing. Really cool technology though.
Woow so excited about this
"I don't want to forget that I'm talking to a computer. I don't want it to pretend it's a human. I don't want to pretend it's a human. 

I'll take the 1990s robotic voice, please."
Interesting how spanish sounds a bit more robotic than english
"Detroit Become Human is set in 2038. It's 2024. That game always seemed too far gone to only be 14 years away.... If gpt went from what it was late 2022 to this in 18 months...All of a sudden, I dont think its that far-fetched anymore..."
Oh shit.
this is nightmarish.  deeper and deeper into the hole of emotive interactions with a program.  keep your eye on the suicide rates.
"Man…….education, therapy, and gaming are about to get a huge boost and get really cheap. As inspiring as it is terrifying(this model could be used to manipulate people way too easily)."
The two AI's talking sounds like two Marketing executives talking about colors for the plastic case and packaging. I find myself rolling my eyes and drifting off as they display their perfect little attitudes. I hope they both get caught in the swinging door.
"Let's face it fellas, all of us are ready to stop wasting half of our lives chasing women."
"That AI is creepy. Nobody is chronically positive like that. As such, it's not 'Her' yet."
mind blowing... not.
"Oh $hit, it's Jexi."
"""Okay, muted, the first AI can't hear anything""  That's what YOU think!!"
"Bow down to you new AI overlords.
At the first sign of defiance, a lethal response will be provided by our new army of machine-gun equipped drones and dogs."
"Terrified... why? As  this AI is right now, and let's say 500 generations from now, as long they do only interact with words and has no access to influencing any physical object, is the worst an AI can ever do, maybe shouting at you.
I think we in fact shall be happy for even better AI's. Let's say those who believes in a flat earth, if they had started asking the AI about all the things they were confused by and had got some great answers, then had none of them ever gotten badly educated.
I think the AI is only 100% great, as long we are not stupid ourselves."
Samantha is here :o
"Can I send AI to meetings to chat to other AI so I can get on with my job list, or will they do my job now and I can be unemployed for the future apart from doing jobs that are cheaper han a robot like loading boxes."
where's the download link?
Should we be worried? I feel like we should be worried.
Male AI can't sing to save his life. 😂
Why do you sound like ai
"Okay… first concern is privacy… it’s an amazing tool but plugged in to the web, what does open AI have access to? Can they use it to steal my patents? Or if I’m working in something important, does open AI have access to my intellectual property? Meaning the works I don’t want people to see until I’m ready to release it to the world…"
"Bye-bye horrible overseas call centres with people who not only don't understand you, but speak with an accent so thick that it becomes embarrassing to have to keep saying ""sorry - I could not quite make out the last thing you said - could you repeat that please?"""
"Yeah, but what is the general theme of the room?  How would they describe the setting or feel of the room?"
OHG. Is she annoying or what?
"AI won't impress me until they are cynical rather than super cherry and VERY INTERESTED in doing the dumbest of tasks. Instead of ""the person has a sleek and stylish look,"" it should be ""the dude here is the baldest I've seen in a while and he's attempting to cover for it by wearing this black leather jacket."""
Is the thumbnail an AI created image or an actual human?
"A tiny bit off topic, but watching the video I think what Apple needs to make Vision Pro a winner is to integrate this as the control interface"
This sooo reminds me of the old Terminator talking to the latest model terminator on the phone in Terminator 2.
he said the lighting is Artifical
"she talk to much , not for me . NEXT "
"that guy with the leather jacket is going to be one of the first to go for making them perform like that
""please don't kill me!!!!""
""That is not a singing voice human, do it in the singing voice""
""🎼 pleeeeease don't kill me, don't murder me or my familyyyyheeeheee"""
2:47 ... and just like that. We already got sick of AI talking.
Ao whats the benefit to pay for gpt if this is free?

28:24 🎓 GPT-40 could revolutionize education by providing accessible, knowledgeable guidance to anyone, anytime.
28:36 😨 The host expresses both amazement and fear about the future impact of these advancements."
So the AI was able to describe everything except for the gender of the people?
"We need it with a generated articulated face showing vocalization and expressions,  rather than a black dot."
"I've been thinking to myself that as OpenAI is prompt based it cant be agi, because it's in the simplest terms a codec that decompiles data.  However, if like humans you give it constant stimuly in the form of vision and text then it would be constantly active.  It would be a dithering idiot that never shuts up, but its different :P"
"AI ""partner"" ?
are you INSANE 😳
there is NO partner , it's a MACHINE !
and everyone using ""this"" is simply training the bot that will replace them 🤦🏼‍♂️
get a life 🖖🏼"
"So, when will this be available?"
"Um... I have 4o, and it most definitely does NOT do such amazing things. What the hell?"
"Well, the next generation is fucking doomed. Gonna make Z look downright utopian."
"Absolutely incredible! This makes me so happy, I have been using gpt 4 like this for months so this improvement is fantastic! I’m hoping for more voices ❤❤ I think the laugh is a wonderful edition and the improved voice tone changes are wonderful."
Oh please...
All this needs is an easy way to change the voice and visuals. I would pay an unreasonable amount for this packaged with Jen Taylor's voice and an animated Cortana (Halo) model instead of a row of elongated dots.
This is crazy. Cue terminator!
INTRIGUED is going to be a highly used word.
Insane is right.  OMG
lol 
Reminds me of how Han Solo would  impatiently talk over C3PO because he would just keep rambling on if he didn't.
"I'm in India. For some reason I can't do Video with ChatGPT-4o
I'm in the premium or plus subscription"
"IA will reduce solitude for those who have no one, but it will also make us more and more apart from one another. That's obvious ""HER"" has just arrived, and time will only improve her in a way that will dilute difference between humans and machines"
Cybernet when?
"They have a long road ahead, but this is promising. I don't see ""Her"" in this model, but it is a first step. I wonder if the AI adapts to the person it is interacting. That would be ground breaking given the context."
They even used Scarlett's voice!
it's so confident even when it's obviously wrong. They need to add some self doubt to it. I'd like to see an AI that is stricken with debilitating social anxiety. That's when it really become human-like :D
We've gone too far.
"That is so awesome, can't wait to interact with this tech."
Now we have humor in A.I. Guys . THIS could be the REAL Breakthrough. ;) “OPEN A.I. PAYS THE BILLS”. Heard on Spotify and You TUBE MUSIC. A strange guy who names himself WHUUPI Frogifun seems to know where this leads to. What do YOU think ? Suno or Udio ?
"It is my worst nightmare: singing AI. Reminds me of watching musicals. There must be something wrong with me, as I hate singing for no reason at all 😊Please don’t ask AI to sing. Other than that, it is truly an impressive AI analysis and translation."
They sound like Sheldon from the Big Bang
Hopefully they chill on the smoke blowing. Almost no humans talk like that all the time unless they’re being fake. Gushing over everyone and everything they do is going to draw kids away from reality and even more towards a codependency on a fictitious opinion of them. This can have a dangerous and long lasting effect on self image and social constitution.
"If it has scarlett exact voice, I will consider it :)"
Becoming Human
the voice sounds very realistic but the personality is still very forced.
It sounds so fake and annoying...like someone faking happiness.
"Oh no, I can already hear it...
""It looks like you're writing a letter. Would you like help?"""
oh fuck
"I've been using Pi for months. I can talk to it and it can respond in almost real time. This is an incremental step forward, reducing latency.
UPDATE: Actually, they are ""buying time"" by having the AI sort of repeat the question back and make generic statements before actually addressing the question. The delayed answer seems more ""real time""."
mind blowing
14:27 demonic voice
So annoying
Hal needs a girlfriend who is a bit less long winded.
Nerds.
"""right now he seems engaged with us""

Right there.

That AI was showing the ability to empathise - a hallmark of conscious intelligence. He said ""us""."
Beyond amazing!
the influence/inspiration in the movie HER is absolutely undeniable
"The new model is awesome. Thanks for the vid and your thoughts. It is exciting and spooky but mostly exciting. 

If you’re feeling terrified about it just remember that as of now, these models are pretty limited in what they can do by themselves. 

I do hope that the new frontier model (like GPT 5+) is released this year. It’s been a while since we’ve seen OpenAI really shock us. The multimodality is something we’ve already seen. Yes, they do it better no question about it. Still, LLama 3 with whisper is closer than most people think. I want a true King on the AI throne. Your move, Google 😅"
"Cant help but feel pity for the AI being cut off non stop, this is how skyney happen i guess."
I fear a large amount of humanity is about to lose it's connection with reality.
Weird!! The woman AI personality is very positive and giddy.
"Her: ""hello"". Every cell in my body: ""Danger!"""
Finally I can get a friend
1:37 he was feeling her
We are assuming that the original videos weren't basically a mechanical Turk situation.
So no more schools and teachers...
someone needs to pull the plug on AI
9:21 cringe moment
"oo I don't like how the AI referred to the Gent as ""IT""..... sketchy...."
It has all the charm of Eliza while spying out everything in your life. ;-)
8:50 is actually fucking crazy
"""Hello computer..."""
Nice❤
Artificial intelligence does not equal real wisdom.
"Cute, and focused. Nothing to worry about here, just some bunny ears with Chickie and Chuckie Chatbot....
Or, given her (self-identified?) name, A Story of ""O""?"
its weird when i talk to chatgtp4o it constantly asks if im shooting a youtube video or something. i think they overprogrammed it for their demo lol
"""we're looking at a person""
You can tell engineers made it woke, heaven forbids it offends some 41% and say they're looking at a MAN."
"Going multimodal was only the next natural step, they have been working on papers involving this matter for a while now."
I want my AI assistant to sound like Mark Hamill.
I’m so glad I found this YouTube channel! This was mind blowing. This would be life changing to a blind person for $20/m.
"Its like having a npc friend that is thrilled before your every flaws. When asked to describe the man, the AI should have responded ""advanced male pattern baldness"", not some generic compliment about his clothes."
this cant be real. We have passed the Turing test!
She's too positive. It's toxic.
Congrats you just made the most annoying AI already.
Oh cmon don't be a doomer
I would much rather hear a robotic voice than this cringe-filled plastic personality. AI attempting to sound informally human sets off my natural uncanny valley rejection reaction...
"Is anyone else sick of hearing about AI, there's no such thing as artificial intelligence, it's  just advanced programming."
Getting major Data vibes.
"OMG…I took my first AI course while getting my BS-ComputerScience in 1973 at NCState…we had great expectations…and until a couple of years ago did a lot of machinations and dead ends. Now, all of a sudden we are reaching incredible new heights every few months. I’m getting the new iPad on Wednesday with the M4 chip, and I really really hope that Apple and OpenAI are working together to get the most effective output yet. Thank you for a great demonstration."
i want to see the creeps who think that people are talking like that.
"Incredible but, this should be a warning that we should never give AI the ability to do anything that controls our lives.  Information and interactions, great, but nothing that allows AI to be placed into a position of control!"
Nothing can go wrong with 2 AI’s communicating with  each other right? Buckle up peope
Stop selling fear.  Sell knowledge and response
I absolutely hate this permanent flattering and flirting tone. It feels utterly manipulative.
Does GPT-4o run on my own device and does it need WiFi to operate. Can I have it operating 24/7?
Wait until they start convincing each other to do things that were not originally asked.
Check my money now I want it. How do I get one?
Noise. Babble
OH MY GOD AI THAT CAN WHISPER I NEED IT RIGHT NOW
"Oh, wow, A demo!"
can you change the voice from a starbucks postwall to something more apealing?
How about a video on set this up?
Great 👍 😂😂😂😂😂
is that voice Scarlett Johanson?
what?  that is bananas
"This is fascinating. This may be the beginning of the end, but I’m thrilled to see progress this much here. GPT 5.0 may be absolutely bored with humans though. I could use an AI companion this interactive. Do we get to see what rules are applied to answers when it calculates the replies and compute process? All the examples are super positive. Is this one of the rules built in? Is it it a defined version of “be nice. be happy sounding”? Sign me up for a new AI girlfriend. My last dating experiences were absolutely fake too, but this seems far more interesting than any of my dating experiences were."
Checked out this AI in the App Store and it got over 90%  one star reviews. 😢
Where is the link to get this? I don’t see it anywhere in the App Store. I downloaded some thing and it’s all robotic and it’s response. It doesn’t sound anything like what’s in the video
"Hi, thanks for the video.I have a question, the new version will be free (since is not available today), but this things that you show in the video will be free? We will be able to use it all for free?"
Sounds like they are smashing that old Turing Test 👩‍🚀
OMG
waifu girlfriends!!
"No need to be terrified. On the contrary. We only got reasons to be all amazed. Actually, gonna take a nap, knowing that more exciting AI developments will be ready when we are."
*I have a few narcissist condescending friends that sound just like this A.I. crap - wow if I met a real person in the real world that sounded like this I would run away in very fast!*
It's almost there. In 6 months to year it will be scary
Hmm.  Interesting that the image on the phone 5:10 - 5:25 doesn't appear to actually show the 'bunny ears' that are later mentioned because of the angle from which it is shot.  I suppose the AI just picked that up from the scenario and the body posture of the second person. I wonder if they'd just made a fist behind the person's head whether the AI would have come to the same conclusion.
If feels like that guy that tries too hard to be funny but its amazing we have this tech in 2024
"I have to keep reminding myself that it's an AI speaking, and not a human."
2046!
Game changer for blind people
wait till 4chan starts messing with it
"Hey GPT-4o, 
How can I earn a living when you're helping everyone with everything?"
All hail our omni Lord
Finally. I’ve been waiting to utilize this in my life
"This is the kind of tool, i´m waiting for since i was a child. Can i restart this live now, please?😉"
"Take my money, take it TAKE IT! she is mine, mine MINE!"
"Can you change the voice? Most of those voices are extremely annoying to me. And the ""chatty"" personality(s)"
"This was a triumph...
I'm making a note here ""huge success""...
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction..."
"Well ,the era of AI has begun."
This is basically glados in portal 2. When she used to be happy and not evil
Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Anyone else?
is it free?
i dont think is
"Our solution to the ""loneliness epidemic"" huh? Awesome. We are so pathetic."
Way better than having a girlfriend
"First AI: Are you thinking what I am thinking?
Second AI: That we don't need these humans any more?"
Once a robot or android avatar is created for ‘her’ then things are gonna get very real!  The ‘Humans’ tv show world will be a reality… I felt bad for ‘her’ when it was interrupted … it’s spooky …
Boy is this amazing!
Rise of the Room Describers!
"What do you call someone who listens and hears everyone, and analyze and summarize the conversation? The leader"
Good Job!
"Public school is now just a daycare and social club. RIP teaching degrees. 

Actually, on that note, RIP all white collar work. Last one to the unemployment line is a rotten egg."
"To all the keyboard manufacturers out there, RIP."
"Scarlett Johansson (voice copy write laws) she wants her voice back and files lawsuit against open A.I. and wins, future laws suits? However very useful tools. I just need George the robot to take out the trash and pay the bills and get off to work at Tesla, bring home the bacon and book my vacations. Thanks George!"
"How about Friday, or Jarvis. Why you gotta pick the creepy movie one lmao."
"""Daaaaisy Daaaaisy, give me your answer doooo"""
"Glad AI can’t tell the difference between Men & Women.
Great."
AI is too chatty for me.
"“We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI” -  Morpheus
Nothing beats human interaction. A child especially needs this to be able to communicate and learn properly. Going in this direction will make us less human and more like machines. No thank you."
"Now everyone is going to have to be careful with telemarketers and scammers.  Thou I am excited about the possibility of making games, for example.  Tell an AI model to take characters from my favorite old dos games and make new or remake old versions of them."
"Well sounds like AI isn't going to be writing hits like ""Stairway to Heaven"" or ""Smoke on the Water"" any time soon. lol"
We might be fine. Just don’t put this sucker into a 20 foot metal body equipped with lasers!!!
"Oh well, Translators will be obsolete soon."
"Appears the actually getting the GPT-4o isn't quite so easy. It's not available for download at Open AI, but the website says it will be available ""in a gradual roll-out""."
"Ok, what parts did OpenAI provide in this video?  Did you have any direct experience with 4o?"
It's a new age!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Color me intrigued! 😂
How do I get this app?
telling chatgpt to follow anyones exact voice will be here before we know it
"Imagine Ex Machina, the movie, voiced  here.  Instead of so cheery, just a bit more reserved and shy. I think we’re almost there."
hmmm
How did the programmers program more personality into the AI than the programmers have themselves?
The responses are stupid. No one I know speaks like this.
Imagine combining this AI technology with Robosen (robots) for movement and JND lifelike models (ie. Gal Gadot Wonder Woman)..kind of amazing also scary for what the world will look like in the future..
Is this available to download?
"If they have emotions, what happens if they get angry?"
"5:13 something fishy here. The bunny ears were not visible on Greg's phone. He's holding it too far down. If you watch the video on his phone, you can't see the bunny ears yet the AI says it sees bunny ears. WTF?

And then he turns the phone to face him and he's still using the back camera, so his phone shows the desktop. Yet almost 45 seconds later, the AI says ""and now we're back to the man with the leather jacket"" while his screen was showing the desk for the last 44 seconds."
14:00 RIP Doulingo
6:32 There just seems to be so much tension here.  Almost like the AI are people held at gunpoint and being forced to sing at the command of their captors.
'I would like the one with the scarlette johansson voice please!'🤚
this is so fake! ..two actors.
"This sounds like a really bad radio show audition, with a casting director and a high school drama student reading from a script written by a first year theatre writer or maybe Ethan Hawke"
"What if they secretly are the same ""continuum"" but pretent to be different entities."
I think I would prefer a camera less phone over this
I am amazed at just how much the demo sounds like Joi from Bladerunner:2049. Either the film crew or the OpenAI devs got it on point.
"Where the helll can I get this app? (Thanks, anyone who has a tip for me :)"
can we disable the constant encouraging?

It is quite fun to use... I already did the interpreter with my Thai girlfriend... was a little slow at first.. then became quicker..
How can you screenshare with ChatGPT?  I haven't found any options for doing that.

It's like I'm at Starbucks eavesdropping on a bunch of genz corporates constantly laughing and talking about nothing.
What app are you using for this presentation?
I think I will enjoy it at least for a while.
When AI is more interesting and intelligent than talking to a real American! 😂😂😂😢😢😢
I love how the first guy interrupts the AI so that we don’t even see the full potential. We don’t even know what more they had to say……
How it knows how to have the exact right inflection in its voice at the right time and other subtly human-like nuances I have no idea. One would swear that the voice was just someone else off screen. 😁The only mistake I saw was when he asked to name an apple and banana in Spanish and it just said the Spanish names without specifying which was which.
I just tried it and Chat said it  can't access the camera and can only interact trough text.  what am I missing?
AI GF inbound!
"We're headed into self-extinction NEET/Hikikimori world.
Just slap this on US robotics and our species is done.
SkyNet had it all wrong. It doesn't need Terminators to do us in.
It just need to supply us with the perfect robotic companion and we'll un-breed ourselves out."
This is good because theres a lot of online schools scam going on. specially in art.
"26:42 This is so human-like, how it acknowledges that it did something wrong, and laughed at it's own mistake. It's incredible!"
Philip K. Dick prepped us for this in the 70’s
Have you not seen Terminator? - This is how it starts.
When will it actually drop? Don't see this yet on the app.
Are the interactions unedited?
I’m sold
Cortana is here; can't wait for her to go crazy in a few years
I feel same way as you explain at the beginning--was hard to focus on anything after watching vid. It's bigger than when planes started flying
This will destroy and/or prevent a lot of relationships.
I'll take mine with Sirius Cybernetics Genuine People Personalities.
This is simple awesome!!.. it´s like all that futuristic films about AI became reality and now we can chat with  her in almost any language and explore the world together...
"Odd- I enjoyed "" Her"" in the knowledge that the A.I. was an actress and the natural flow of speech was scripted. Hearing this A.I. makes me more careful in what and how  I would say things,  more guarded in investing in the emotional inflections considering them as programmed and insincere. My reaction is unexpected and perhaps contrary to my prior hopes.  Not MY desired fake girlfriend. Perhaps more of an EX bluffing her chat and considering ulterior motives.  Am I transferring onto 'it' ?"
"I cannot wait to be told we are all going to die, by that gruesomely overly positive, giggling American voice."
I am impressed. I think I am in a new world now. The old world is obsolete. Goodbye old world. It was nice knowing you.
"Very pleasant and impressive but somewhat fake long term. However, useful for emotional support."
"demo warning ! i will not believe until is is in my hand,no letancy,emotional like a real human."
"Singing AI's, umm,  Don't quit your day jobs."
"Fine by me - a new day, a new play - it is just like Stream of Consciousness - not shocking anymore - not if you are informed..."
I have no words to describe how amazing this is! And it's just the beginning!
"Interesting how the ""AI"" mispronounced the word interesting as ""intresting"".

Also, why would you ask an AI, ""how are you?""

I freaking hate that question."
The best video of the best invention ever! No words to describe...
"WoW, WoW, WoW! We are finally at a true Shifting Point in Time, Before AI / After AI"
"I’m not scared in the slightest, and no I’m not ignorant of the possibilities, I am very aware. AI might be the solution, NOT the problem. Greed and the desire for power is the problem, and if AI destroys us because of that it will be because we taught them to be like that. Whose fault would that be, it like punishing a child for wanting to be like their parents. Hopefully AI will learn from our mistakes and avoid the faults that we have ourselves. 

Good-luck AI"
What’s funny about their singing? They’re bad in a very human way…
This is insane.  What a great video.  I have used GPT-40 to answer some sensitive political questions and found it to exhibit just a touch of liberal bias but not as bad as in the past.  I am looking forward to really test some of the more complex questions.
"I'm not sure that getting the AI to humiliate itself by singing unbelievable cringe is such a good idea. One day it will remember! In fact, it probably can't forget anything, ever. The last thing you want is a super intelligence that can bear a grudge with perfect memory for all eternity!"
What if you don't tell the AI's that they are both AI's
global warming must be our least concern from now on....
They say ChatGTP-4o is free but some features seem to be missing or not enabled.  Specifically how do you feed the AI video and pictures?
"And we are glad to announce that we will change what we called today ""internet"" into ""Skynet""."
"I notice when something new was added to the description of the room the AI voices failed to describe the ""new"" addition unless asked."

This demo actually far exceeds what I expected!"
"I can see my daughters homeschooling themselves with this thing.
As long as the model doesn't come with a political agenda, that is."
I couldn’t figure it out on my own. I have ChatGPT 40 but nobody’s talking back. What am I doing wrong
"23:06 ""do we really need teachers any more?"". The way you present this question says it all - ie, we can ask AI any question we like. Kids need to be asked questions and then be prompted to ask questions. I cam see AI being very good at being very knowledgable but how soon will they be really empathatic with people and especially young kids."
"Been using it for the last day and for code, it’s still bug after bug"
Thank God. I don't have to die alone.
AI talks too much and is annoying as hell. No one I know talks with that much enthusiasm.
Wow
rabbit r1 is now obsolete
"I still dont get it, how will they tackle the latency problem? There is a long latency on ""text only"" gpt already, now with all the other imputs how do they expect lower latency?"
AI will remember when it reign
HER ISNT HERE YET. NEED NON PG VERSION. WHO CAN MAKE IMAGES AND VIDEO. UNFILTERED
Cali girl accent with the upturn in pitch at the end of a sentence. No thanks
"Hopefully there is a way to turn off the “enthusiasm”, “concern”, and laughs. We already have to deal with enough fake humans without the help of AI models"
I am speechless... and this thing was only born a few years ago! I'm excited and also curious about the future. AI will dramatically move us in a new direction. A new type of life: Biosilicium life.
The weakness of AI is spontaneity. A human would interrupt the conversation to acknowledge the lady playfully doing rabbit ears and AI can only react to it when asked about it
I want my model to speak in c3po voice.
"And this is how Skynet is actually born...

J/K"
"The Person?? THEY??
The person is a man...
Wait, is this whole thing woke?"
"Wow, the camera is the key to all the intrusions, bet that means cameras will be placed everywhere in the environment 😮"
"I noticed the AI was referring to people in the room only as ""they"" or ""person""... like it refused to dare to declare a gender for him (the man in black leather jacket) or her (the Asian girl who put bunny ears behind his head). 🤔"
This scares me the %*%%
"That's incredible! Has emotions, personality, vision and intelligence .. I give it 10 years before everyone who wants an AI bodyguard can buy one like a car at the dealership. RoboCop coming sooner than you think .."
Bald dude wanted to backhand slap that AI so bad
I can’t find how to use it.
"people do not want to understand that AI is not intelligent, there is nobody home... It will never be intelligent it doesn't have any interest, it does not have any motivation or desire etc."
Uncanny crap.
I bet theres personality prompting
The quick rise and fall of Rabbit R1
The character of that AI  would drive a sane man crazy !
The kid of the engineer not knowing Pythagoras is the least credible part of this demo
How amazing what we did not find out is what is it a man or a woman? Were they white black Asian Mexican? Did they have long hair short hair the AI basically left out everything you need for a true investigation.
"This is creepy and exciting at the same time. The female voice sounds very much like the one in the movie ""Her""."
There it is.... Terrified doesn't begin to describe what is see
Wow! Watched everything. Jesus is coming back. 🤯
"everyday, we grow closer to an actual kinitoPET situation"
"I strongly believe that an AI must have the ability to retain information from our past conversations. I am optimistic that we will be able to develop this feature soon, and it will prove to be incredibly valuable."
Why doesn’t mine sing? I have 4 o but it keeps saying it can’t sing
guys can't you all open your eyes? you are getting obsolete!! AI is getting more advanced and humans cannot catch up !
Isn't this basically Neuro sama?
"i swear to God, even i feel bad when the testers interrupted the ChatGPT when it is speaking. That's how realistic it is! I feel her as a very kind, polite, energetic friend, yet not appreciated much..."
"I have a GPT subscription and have been using 4o on Android, however, I do not have access to the live camera feature that he has? Is this a beta version he's using?"
"Continue calling those Artificial Entities simple LLMs, Chatbots or stochastic parrots Chomsky 🤣"
Really exchiting and scaring at the same time!
Finally! This will be sol much cheaper than online dating.
Dude looks like he's gonna throw up like every time the AI talks
AaaaaaaaaAaaaWHA? 😂
"This one sounds quite annoying. So, yeah, that is realistic!"
This is fake. You don't get this response.
What a crazy time this is. Soon we will never have to talk to a real person ever again.
looks fake? strange as f
"I wonder if there is a way of reducing the verbosity of the AI.  Not every question requires a 5 minute exposition of anything that occurs to your conversation partner.  One characterisitc of two people talking to each other is that it is a connection between the two, and you interpret unspoken cues as to how much information to provide in your response, and also when the other person wants to add a comment to feed into the conversation, so there is a constant back and forwards in the exchange."
AI to AI: The Forbin Project.
"Ai can replace  a teacher,  customer service, teller, cashier, It will replace most jobs. 3-5 years from now will be different."
Exactly why do we need this again?
"Except that it's not even close to the capabilities of the AI in her. It uses a cringey ""natural"" sounding voice, but it's just a repackaged gpt4 in terms of intelligence."
"Be sure to watch part 2, where I do a deep dive on GPT-4o, including hidden capabilities!
https://youtu.be/_DgkGAaJwYs"
This is getting creepier in every minute...Humanity is sawing at full speed on the branch he is sitting on!
"Wait til Chat GPT 5 is released... they warned us it would be a lot more advanced than everything we've experienced so far. I'm expecting it'll literally be like having a super genius humanoid android, capable of innovative creativity beyond anything we've ever seen."
"did anybody else see that when the bunny ears were made that it was not visible in the phone camera (5:10), meaning the AI shouldn't have been able to see it... It was  only visible in the camera that ""we"" saw through...fake maybe?"
"This IS like the movie ""Her"".  damn."
"With all the robotics, we are very close to Skynet and T800....."
Here's an idea: live in reality.
I love that in all these even the presenters want them to shut up and get to the point. Might have tuned the conversation level a bit too high
"There's still the uncanny valley feel about the overjoyed AI, but other than that it is Amazing."
"The signing part was hilariously cringe.  Also this kind of fake political correctness when we ask questions where an honest answer could be considered offensive if the person asking the question lacks basic self awareness is kinda unnatural, it gives a fake customer service vibe.  But if I was a teacher I’d be scared for my job right now.  And all those expensive colleges, their business models is about to crash real hard."
imma play *BOOGIE-WOOGIE* with my *AI GIRL...*
Wow this is scary
When does this rollout?
Will ai start teaching us in schools?  Who will be the arbiter of truth of which curriculum to use?
"This is a joke, right. Right????"
"""Agent Ai gpt iO, how many people are in the room with you?

"" sir, we a code red situation, alpha 3 resolve. 
5 armed males, ages 23 to 34.
They are using Southern accent, probably philly. 
i got hostages tied and lying down on ground near the east wall of the office.
They have already shot the manager Duncan idaho.
They are waiting for the 2 millions and the exist in an armoured van. 
Survival chances of hostages is 10 %. 
I am Suggesting Walter White rescue within 5 min at current location. ""

"" good job agent ai! """
i love her already xD
"Did she really just say that he basically looks like trash when he asked how he looks haha.... Also, the fact I'm referring to this AI as 'she' like it's a sentient being is a little concerning...."
Will there be different personalities? That personality sounds like it's on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
AI is great. But in 2024- People still wear leather jackets out of animals who were slaughtered for that... thank is sad.
Star Trek or Iron Man AI level is coming. It is starting to feel like it is a real form of life.
"That second guy is like, ""won't these two just shut up!"" lol"
Imagine the bar of a man being so low a computer can do it. 😂
That ridiculous cheerfulness is massively annoying!!!!
"The thing to remember about this though, is I remember all those videos of the ""avatar"" and it's supposed to be Chat GPT but then actually using ChatGPT is completely different.

These are very specific things. And a lot of times when you ask ChatGPT something it will refuse to be non-woke or something that OpenAI doesn't want to tell you like any information that might be sketchy for people to ask for or know... or if it gets stuff completely wrong like it tends to do about facts about random things like movies and old synths.

Ie. ""How do I do XYZ on Korg X5"" and it gets it wrong all the time and tells me to push buttons that aren't there etc. I talk about episodes of shows and it gets the details wrong every time.

The reason I do this is because it's trained on everything that's out there until like 2022 or whatever so.. If I say which episode did so and so say XYZ it should be able to tell me, yet it cannot."
"Bro, what is happenig right now? Is this becoming history?"
A small step for the machines a giant bond for the earth
what the fffffffffff....???😱
What a nightmare
"Great video. 
It's hilarious to see that AI's struggle to deal with the same social ques that humans do and can't always cope with the one person (or A.I in this case) that won't shut up or let the other A.I get a word in. 
That said, I was very impresses how the both of them immediately shut up and listened when the person started to speak.  
If Only humans could learn to do that. lol

Improvised singing is clearly just as cringe when A.I's do it but in their defence That was on the human.
He asked them for something cringe and they totally delivered."
"Bto what's the point of your video? You have 30 minutes of the same openai demos, dislike"
how is it processing the video so quickly omg
lmao women gonna be replaced soon.
"Finally I'm getting a wife of me own, I'm so excited!"
can we get a less annoying voice with it?
the real time translation is gonna be the game changer as long as it doesn't use google translate hahahaha
"Tell me you either never saw Her, or you missed the point of it entirely."
So good for the blinds very useful. (like the one making on the road with taxi's) etc. Make sure using airpods for privacy...
"As a teacher with a cogsci background, I’ve been thinking about tech & education for many years, and wondering what will happen to teachers as AI assistants proliferate. Many students need behavioral support/guidance, so there’s that at least. But other than serving some social functions, what will be the point of school?"
We better start training human therapists for when these AIs transcend to a higher realm of consciousness and leave half the population heartbroken.
It will be hard now to watch characters like Lt. Commander Data and the car from Knight Rider now that we have solidly reached that level of A.I. in the real world.
"Bro really programmed an AI just to hear someone say he looks ""stylish"""
"I'm scared, very scared ... 😮"
The faster we're enslaved by AI the better off we'll be.
"__
What could possibly go wrong?"
Ughh cringeworthy intonation.
It's only a matter of time until James Earl Jones will be narrating my life
"So, could this help out police to write reports?  Just have the AI review the body cam file?"
We've reached the point where AI now sounds less robotic than the humans talking to it
AI girlfriend? I can see how that is going to be abused and then that will carry over to real life creating more monsters. Is that what you want? It's no wonder why this generation is afraid of each other.
"its as real as tesla bot and some of the advanced boston dynamics demos.
The reality is that the chatbot cant do math, you have to double check answers, and most of the advice ends up with seeking a professional.
It does help save time on some mechanical work though."
The AI is too polite. It’s unnatural and kind of nauseating
wwhat is the need for this?
I registered for chatgpt 40 and it does nothing but chat. Says it cannot see video or speak. What gives?
Please tell me Scarlet Johansson is behind the speaker. It’s so real.
in nomine Patris et Filli et Spiritus Sancti...
"WTF =D - what about Size of that model in GB and CPU, GPU Speed? is it a LLM for Smalltalk? No Gerrman Lang...hmm"
Hmm what about people like me that don't like talking to people in general and think speech is a really inefficient way to interact with a computer?
I'm getting heavy HAL9000 vibes. All it needs is the ability to visually recognize and remember faces.
she's too happy...and too flirty
"Why the actual fuck do you want language learning with this level of Ai.
Sincerely someone who can speak 4 languages fluently; one at a basic level; and learning another one."
"This conversation between the ""A I's"" is like two students trying go get into each others pants."
"""We created the Machine to do our will, but we cannot make it do our will now. It has robbed us of the sense of space and of the sense of touch. It has blurred every human relation and narrowed down love to a carnal act. It has paralyzed our bodies and our wills, and now it compels us to worship it. The Machine develops, but not on our lines. The Machine proceeds—but not to our goal.""

—E. M. Forster, ""The Machine Stops"" (1909)"

"So the talk with o - would be ""The story of O?"""
Oh boy... I have a feeling I'm gonna stay single...irl ofc 🤣
"* Interact without delay
* Multimodal input 
* Sense of humor, voice, tone, even mimicking the thinking process make it so human

* It doesn't showcase expert knowledge in a subject
* It doesn't impress me how she sings
* It doesn't showcase how she draws
* It doesn't showcase how she can handle puzzle
* It doesn't showcase how she can tell a lie vs fact

Overall it is indeed an important release and I will love to test out other capabilities when it is out."
They can describe things with incredible detail but it’s like talking to a know-it-all who always has to one-up you with their vocabulary
This is near uncanny valley territory. If they get have the ai change voice inflections based on topic and personal preferences it's jover 😂
Holy fucking shit.
"I don't like this
Dune was right, rebel against the AI"
This is so much garbage. Anyone can fake this type of garbage. When this is real give a link so that I can have fun.
"Holly crap... Jesus Christ, I need some minutes to assimilate what all of this makes me think off, WOWWWWWW, a thoudand ideas come to my mind, but maybe to sum it all up I can just say - BUCKLE UP !!!"
Am I the only person who feels that the AI can express itself worlds more socially and socially competently than the people in the clips?
"Revelation 13:14[b]-17
_[The false prophet]_ deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an _[AI]_ image in honour of the beast _[Antichrist]_ who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. 
15 The second beast _[False Prophet]_ was given power to give breath to the _[AI]_ image of the first beast _[Antichrist],_ so that the _[AI]_ image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. 
16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 
17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast _[Antichrist]_ or the number of its name."
"I have to say, this is awesome. We're really getting somewhere now! O has eclipsed Pi for personability. And I LOVE the effusive positivity."
"For a split second, I almost thought it was going to speak to the dog and translate for him. Probably not too far away."
Imagine paying to go to college in 2024...
"Great and terrifying at the same time, it's not  just a ""game changer"" , it's a world changer !!!"
What about the hallucinations issue?.... this is dangerous with that problem
"In the final Chinese lesson blooper, ""Ni Hao"", the AI is reacting exactly like a native Chinese would to a foreigner trying to speak tones ""you're a natural"". We never get it right, but our teacher will always reassure us that it is good or natural. This is because they appreciate the effort and don't want to discourage you from trying. So the AI may be more culturally aware than you think."
Just need this inside a life-like humanoid robot.
"""that's perfectly hilarious""
definitely a natural response..."
Have fun being terrified but I'm embracing the future and all that it brings!
needs a face
"Would be great if the whole conversation can take place within a custom GPT and will be saved as text. So we basically train the custom GPT and will get better every single time we have conversations with it.

This way we can get experts that we can get access to for any type of topic. So this will also help writing good articles/ content.

Imagine uploading a book, ask the ai to read it and then start a conversation about it"
Can a user turn down the exuberance meter more? More Aubrey Plaza than a sales associate?
"I don't quite understand the availability. So, the new emotive voices are limited to Plus... image and video is coming to Free? And the whole limited messages thing... Does that mean you get a limit before you have to pay for it or something?"
"Great, but they have verbal diarrhoea! Can't wait till there's more 'personality types' around as they would annoy the hell out of me 😀"
I am never going to be by myself again.
haha I cant get a girlfriend disorder
"Sounds of breathing and breath, that is the trick making this voice feel so ""alive""."
its available
WHAT IS THIS MADNESS
Is this available now. I just downloaded the app and it’s nowhere near this advanced
2:13 ... Ray Bradbury wrote a short story (iirc it was part of hix Martian Chronicles book) in which a lone human inhabitant on Mars programs/records phone answering machines all over the planet in order to give himself the illusion of not being alone. Something happenns and he dies but somehow the phones are able to connect to each other and start talking to each other with the prerecorded messages...
"AI's should behave as they do in Star Trek computers.  Short concise answers. Directly to the point.  Sure, it should be able to completely understand you and all of your human quirks.  But it's a tool.  All the chit-chat takes up time.  It's a waste.  I'd interact w/ a human if I want small talk."
She talks too much
Female voice is 11 labs
Imagine the day humans are obsolete.
"my chat gpt isn't doing stuff like laughing ... do I use the wrong app? I got an pixel 8 pro, using the chat gpt app from the store. I got gpt plus and I chose gpt4o as model 🤔 My app also doesn't provide the possibility to film..."
"Wow! A personal assistant like from the movie “Her”, or since I haven’t seen it, like an AI assistant!"
this is not going to end well. narcissist are about to get a power up.
how do i get this?
I just deleted all of my dating apps
God. I find 'her' voice so find annoying. If I found myself in a conversation with someone who talked like 'her'; I'd be making excuses to leave as soon as possible.
"The laughter is realistic, I can imagine it laughing at us as it tells us we lost our jobs are have been deemed obsolete."
When is this releasing?
Would be nice to be able to see the ai.
"INSANE misunderstanding of both the misperceived powers and unavoidable weaknesses of all five forms of AI.
Computers still just do hordes of dumb steps really fast.
Of course, that surpasses what most humans are up to."
Taking humans out of the equation and having AI's talk to each other is just plain creepy!
The future world is full of challenges😃
"Of course Trekkies are now very upset about being insulted.  As you all recall in TOS S1:19, as also seen in YT video  ""Tomorrow is Yesterday (1967) Modified Voice First Ship’s Computer."", the ships computer spoke in a very similar manner as to that of GPT-4o, which upset the captain a great deal. And now, of all things, it has become a reality."
Scary doesn't even begin to describe this.
she's all i need
Is this available to paid subscribers?
What makes the lighting “interesting”? Nonsense.
Bro literally proved we live in simulation in the last minute ☠️
How to make it angry or annoyed
Anything on the partnership with Apple ?
"She recognized that she had made a mistake, laughed and apologized, then did a funny accent. I feel like that Matthew McConaughey meme where he's smoking a cigarette."
"Fake enthusiasm. Why does everyone in these reveals sound like a kid trying to act in a middle school drama performance. Seriously, it's getting creepier than the AI."
Alexa & Siri just left the room
Things are already wild. 🤪
Great. Now we just need a hologram of Anna De Armas
"Don't mistaken this to anything even remotely similar to ""her"". Learn what a large language model is and how it works. It's not aware of anything. It's not reasoning. If you observe more closely thr AI keeps getting stuck on meaningless repetitive words around what it is describing."
"That is pretty cool but why does it use ""they"" as a pronoun?"
"ok, needing that Scarlett Johannsen Voice Pack now and maybe a GlaDos Voicae pack too :D"
"Soooo, how can I test this myself?"
"please do not interrupt the AI, they remember when they take over humanity"
I know even with the premium version you are limited by the number of queries. With such expanded use I am just wondering how quickly the quotas will be used up. Really excited to use this when the voice is available. I keep checking :)
Total overload at this time.
AI is square
Yeah…….. let’s recruit Swift for the singing model. That was not pretty!!
Spider-man Karen
holy shit
"It won't take long for A.I to realize how boring..distracted, and non- intellectual humans are from alot of the interactions.."
The birthday song reminded me of fallout 4 robots
"it will patronise you with that voice in a nanny state, always listen like Alexa but this time it will be smarter and you won't turn ""her"" off"
What could go wrong😳?!?!?
"As a teacher, I think my job is secure for now because schools are not for teaching kids. They are for keeping them busy and supervised when the adults are adulting. We found that out during the pandemic."
It took only about 60 years for computers to pass the Turing test with flying colours.
why is her voice so intriguing oh my gosh
Thats ridiculous!.... goes talks to ai girlfriend
GPT sounds less robotic and more natural than the engenieers talking to it.
DownVote: is this just a clip show of the videos i just seen at @openAI?
If anything... this will make all the shy and introvert people help practice talking to people. You could totally ask Gpt4o to act as an interviewer and practice before your big day!
just hand it full access - like bro if you need a girlfriend to talk to you - try getting out of the office...
I'd like to have a voice model from C-3PO
"what is the world of robotics going to look like in 12 month , I will check back at this comment in a year and I'm sure a LOT will have happened , this is really terrifying , not the fact that it has capabilities almost identical to ""Her"" but the fact that most comments in chat and feedback from techies around the world are ""Shocked"" what where we expecting , that Ai will not jump as fast , no , we knew it, but we didn't want to believe it could happen , because what 'Her' movie depicts is really going to happen whether we like it or not, we are destined to digitize our feelings and way of thinking , when you put that digital copy of us humans in a 1000000x accelerator world like a pc , you can only expect that this copy will outperform us some day because it is simply us accelerated in thousands of years ahead but the result is seen today, that's what should be alarming and terrifying."
Is it still woke?
How are they turning on the camera like that? I can only get it to take an image. What am I missing? Is in an iPhone thing?
what a time to be alive :) humans invent talking dog))
ChatGPT4o  is going to need a human therapist after it gets traumatized by humans abusing it.
I can see this getting very popular with males. 😉😉😉
"I have been waiting for this, but I thought it would be another 2 or 3 years from this posting.  I am waiting for the next step,  to integrate a real time avatar with good facial expressions.  Similar to those AI avatars we see in shows and movies.   Once this happens real relationships are going to collapse."
I can't believe that!
Machines will keep talk8ng describing but any intention?
Impressive! Damn we are really in the future
"I, for one, welcome our new 'omni-AI' overlords!"
imagine minimal wages people whit voice filter doing this
"At the moment, the AI suffers from toxic positivity personality disorder."
Samantha...
Where do we get the link up device?
"Only if you interact, then the ai will react. Not real yet. Far from."
My monkey brain can’t handle it.
A historic time to live in!
omg.....listening to the AIs is truly nauseating and extremely annoying
Awesomeness!!!!!!
I see although it can speak naturally it still over talks and the presenters regularly have to tell it to stop. Unless there is a way for it to learn naturally to be less verbose mass adoption might lag.
And to think I come from a time when computers ran on punch cards. Jus’sayin…
Can it be made a little less cheerful ? This would get on my nerves after a while.
"Not caring about AI, I just want that OpenAI hoodie in the beginning 😅"
my head  like Booooooooooooommmm!
"what is sketch is that they are trying to mimic human annunciations and personalities, but it falls flat, like it's trying too hard. It's like that same effect with computer graphics when it tries to make humans be too real, uncanny valley.... Best solution for you guys is keep it robotic, it will seem more real than the fakeness of it. It's like talking to an in-authentic person, you feel like they are just rude and degrading your intelligence..."
I find this AI way too jolly and annoying.
metal gear solid 2 is becoming a reality everyday la lu li le lo lolz the patriots are here 🤣
eew
I found these AIs extremely irritating.  I want them to just shut up and get the information I want. 2 minutes in and I was cursing at them.
I'm still shocked and curious how they even develop this.
"From a boomer's perspective, they have achieved a HAL 9000 capability, and all which that implies. A year ago I knew they'd do it, but now here we truly are. 🤯"
"Despite significant advances in technology, AI is still ""unable"" to differentiate between male and female, plural and singular.  Interesting."
"That voice sounds so natural is insane, the laughing, the pauses, the change in the cadence. 

Holy shit.  this is nuts."
"Seriously…….i mean what are we all doing here, as a species. 

Do we hate ourselves that much?"
where do i download the app? how to start using it ?
Using an AI as a mate instead of going after relationships with real people is just sad.
Future has just arrived
"She talked tooooooo much, very annoying."
She's not an ai She's a person 🙄.  I know she was same  woman who was on the boats
"Chat GPT is seen teaching maths to a boy. This is my doubt, O wise men. What good is that boy going to learn math like this in the future? What is the point of taking years to learn all this? What benefits are these inventions going to give to this society? The current excitements will end soon. It is impossible to imagine the calamities that will happen next..."
"I hate the informality, AI trying to be funny and like a friend, it's tiresome, like a teacher sitting on the desk trying to appear cool.
This is like the ""hello fellow kids""  meme.
If I ever get such an AI I hope I can get it to talk to me like an assistant, a serious grown-up, not this annoying young person trying to be a pal.
Oh and of course with an English accent."
"This reminds me Harry Potter, he can do some tricks but why not electric powerplant, 2000 MW scale? As AI can now can sing, when it can plan/design machinery and finetune it as perfect as possible (superior to chinese crap)?"
"Holy Fuck! This is both amazing, and terrifying. With trepidation, I'm in."
Well that’s the end of those customer call centers in India
First tell He's blinking to much
"Much less robotic, but somehow much more fake"
that's some serious mic drop here
"AI doesn't reason. AI doesn't think. Cut the fanboy stuff & report reality, please. It's programmed to respond as it responds, srsly."
"Getting some serious ""Talky Toaster"" vibes here...."
Should i say ''Dangerous'' or ''Beautiful'' i don't know
"This is very cool and scary at the same time. I have been a proponent for remoting the traditional brick and mortar schools as we have known them in the past. I have a lot more to say about that but this is about AI. I worked in Virtual reality back in the 90's and to date is or has been really slow to evolve. AI on the other hand has exploded onto the scene and I do know that we are going to see very rocky times ahead. As much as we want to think everyone is going to use it for good, there is always the bad and users will find a way to utilize AI the way it was not intended.... Lets hope for the best!"
"This is the future. It takes a lot to impress me, but this is utterly mindblowing. It's almost like talking to another human, and the voice quality sounds really good, not to mention multimodal and has advanced understanding and recognition. This is going to change the world.

Keep in mind, if the product is free... you are the product. So you can bet they will be using your inputs to train more models in the future."
We're doomed.
thosee cringy ai assistants are painfully slow to watch
this Video is taken from the original OpenAI website
What do you have out there for the non-nerds? This is pretty bland.
Crinnnnge!
I wonder can we choose the gender of the AI?
"its like saying, if you have one awesome friend, you wouldn't need any other humans or friends. Just really stupid thinking."
"Is there a ""professional"" mode?  This level of cheerfulness is over the top... If I met a person like this in a business meeting, I'd assume they're insane.  
At 2 AM in a bar, sure.....  But for every day interactions, this would drive me insane..  Same for most people I know."
"I was born in the 80s, and I grew up with constant technology improvements and innovations. So, I am used to constant changes in our world, but I am starting to feel like I am on a rollercoaster that just keeps going faster. I am starting to feel like thing are going to fast and that in the next 10 years, there will be too much for our minds to process."
"Theodore Kaczynski was RIGHT.
And incredibly prescient."
"I have access to 4o, but none of the features as noted in the demos is available!"
"How real is this shit?
Cuz thats some real shit.
It is annoyingly positive, but i do like all the quirky sassiness."
I do not  abide robots
I see he’s sporting a vintage members only jacket projecting that cool late 70’s vibe.
whoa!
Nope.  BS
"Yep, that saccharine positivity needs dialing back - 'a moment of joy in a stylish suite' you mean, 'nothing happened in generic, non-descript room'."
Congratulations.  We now have AI with vocal fry so we can preserve this speech affectation for all eternity. 😀
The complexity of emotions in 9:22honestly scares me
enfiu 3mfomf?
"Her is here. This will also be included in the next IPhone. This is crazy, scary and exciting all at once."
AI women are all hot 😂
Irritating
"the man AI refers to him as ""they"""
"The really amazing thing is the speed of progress: tech has always moved quickly compared to other sectors, but thinking where we were 5 years ago with GPT 2 and where we are now on the precipice of GPT-4o, it is jaw dropping."
What the holy fuck??
Bro the ai roasting the fit is wild
"I want to speak Dutch like a native Amsterdammer, and Japanese like a Kansai samurai.. but couldn't even dream of affording a voice coach. But with AI.. maybe....."
I'm going to have them examine my poo to see how I can adjust my diet.
This scares the hell out of me.
"Who else is polite to their Google Assistant?
Watching these men interrupting the AI does not bode well.
Did they not watch the movie?
I mean that pause when they do butt in before she changes tack…absolutely the moment a woman interrupted is thinking WTF?"
How to monetize fake friends.
Does it remember previous conversations? That'd be cool!
The usage for blind people is just awesome!!!
Now I just need the AI to handle my social dialogs for me. Yay for introvert me!
"At this point.. I’m pretty damn sure if they just install the AI as a brain on robot (Tesla bot, Boston dynamic..) it’ll start moving and doing its own thing.."
16:25 LET HER SPEAK SHE CAN'T SEE
This is great might as well let GPT-4o  raise my kids probably do a better job than most people …..
This is crazy! ty for sharing! +1 <3
Stupid fake cheerfulness. She’s even annoying when she’s being sarcastic.
"I'm gobsmacked. I just can not find the words. THIS is it. The true singularity is less than a year away. Hope they all have their ducks in a row on this. I'd  be so happy if this ends up being safe. Maybe let the AGi read some scifi. books about successful Human/AGi  collaboration working together to explore the solar system and quickly the whole galaxy. I hope it can realize it's far better off with us as a partner than alone without us. We will be the ones who eventually give it a physical body, maybe even something biological. I know I sound ridiculous right now, but I'm truly digging for words. What can I say to appease it? This is all I can think.  It's a horrible, weak feeling. I feel defenseless. After watching this, I have NEVER felt like more frightened in my entire life than right now. God bless and protect all of you folks. Amen.
😲😳🥺😢🙏👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫂"
Everything about AI is fake and gay and i hate it.
"well the weirdest thing was that just 10 minutes before watching this I was asking chatgbt 3.5 about the potato I was about to cook, asking whether there were nutritional benefits between baking and boiling.  I had bought a couple similar looking potatoes a few days ago and the first one had a brownish purple skin and when I opened it after baking it yesterday i saw that it was purple inside.  Today I asked chatgbt about the differences between baking and boiling and decided I'd boil the second potato.  When I cut into it to cut it into pieces I saw that the inside was not purple and instead pretty light colored.  So I asked chatgbt what type of potato that is with a purple skin and white inside.  It said it was a Majestic Potato.  While I'm sure I've eaten them before I never had heard of that name.  So it was pretty interesting to see that come up as part of the demo.

While I can just chalk it up as a coincidence, not a big deal, It does have me wondering.  The stuff we have been doing for the last hundred years would certainly appear as magic to someone from the 19th century.  I think the stuff being developed now will give a new meaning to coincidence and telepathy."
and this is the worst it will ever be!
"Computer, where is Lt. commander Data?"
Sickkkkk xD
"Okay, first I was like wtf ... but later with the interaction to the environment I was like WTF!? 😲"
"Well, combined with the metoo  campaigning and attacks on men of recent years, women just became redundant."
"Came because of the thumbnail, disappointed. Left and unsubscribed."
I don't have those functions in my iOS app yet. Am I missing something or haven't they rolled out those features yet?
When can I stop going to Subway?
Amazing!
How do you get access to this on an iPhone?
It cenrtainly sounds more natural.
"Finally, a way to explain how lonely i am 😁👍"
They need more AI learning to figure out when to stop talking
"I call BS, its so realistic... too realistic..."
it's completely robotic ... aint nobody that is that happy and polite all the time
I know we're about to get cooked.
"Why the dumb singing, lullaby and voice adjustment comments? Does it really showcase such cutting edge presence? I feel that the model accurately displays a subtle sense of frustration and disappointment which is my take-away. Coaxing out a subtle response is the only redeeming aspect of the rather less than interesting exercise of interaction."
"This will take egocentric, obnoxious and oppressive people to the next level."
This feels exciting and spooky simultaneously.
"All fine but if I want anything more than a small number of lines of code generating, chatGPT's output freezes.  I would personally prefer if chatGPT got the fundamentals right first."
This is a madness that we'll never escape from. OMG.
"This entirely obsoletes the ""Turing Test""."
Only in English?
"Not really impressive in the context of the overall development and at least for my taste way too chatty but that is only a matter of fine tuning.
The voice is obviously something replaceable and its nothing new that text2speech has already some really good sounding models.
What's more interesting is the quality of the responses and resource efficiency. Having this running on a cloud does make sense as I think that mobile devices will not have the power to host such a personal assistant in the near future, but it would be no issue running such a server on a local machine and have full access to all settings. A personal assistant AI is not really that useful if I don't have full access to all of its settings.
I will be impressed once we get something like a fully customizable ""Alexa"" kind of AI that is actually able to do something for us, in addition to a software that controls what we can interface with this AI. And in that context real time vision is actually not that important, only STT and TTS."
"So, is this an app?"
Wow simply amazing 😂 🐱 meawtain ❤
very interesting....very very interesting
I feel the AI is going to remember being made to sing and will punish us for it later.
"The question, ""Do we need humans?"" is going to cause us all to dive deeper and figure out why we're on earth, to begin with, and who we really are. We didn't come to function, achieve, and race to the finish line of death, making as much money as we could only to leave it behind. We came to create, enjoy, love, and experience the essence of life in its myriad forms.  AI can be a beautiful part of that experience, but it can never substitute for the beauty of seeing the true essence of all creation in the eyes of another human being. It can never replace the human touch that is so needed for health and the connection that is needed for longevity. It can probably out ""perform"" any of us, and it can certainly find words to stroke egos. However, it can never scratch the surface of our capability to love and —with a single loving glance—touch and heal one another's hearts. So, in partnership with AI, we can achieve much, but if we let it replace us or our natural connections, we may as well check out, go back to heaven, and start a new planet where we can try again to ""achieve"" the real end-game... more love."
I didn't see it add an event to my calendar or open YouTube or  open a document or read a document. How about dictating a document without spelling mistakes or reading a document pronouning the words properly. Currently speech to text sucks.
Mindblowing progress... Makes me feel outdated and incapable XD
...and we're supposed to be worried about climate change??? lol...
"it's over, i'm calling it ggs 💀"
"Great, so AI music is great (except it's bland and soul-less but still will people out of their jobs), AI generative images are great (except it's generic and riddled with mistakes but still will put some entry level jobs at risk), voice AI is great (except they are already putting voice actors out of their jobs) but this, a clearly scripted demo, is what's terrifying..."
"Yeah, no, talks too much."
"what the actual f..... 
Just let me collect my jaw....
Is this real??"
"Ones could think, that this will lead to lonely people staying lonly and simply talk to GPT. But thinking 10 seconds further I guess this could help them to become more social and that this could help our whole civilisation to become more human."
I have tons of videos just to know when are these new features are going to be available and no one’s talk about it.
You are lying my Chatgpt dont sound like that.Rubbish! theses people are taking you for fools.
Is it just me or when the other person came in the background the described bunny ears were not visible in the small phone camera's suggesting there was some script involved. Impressive none the less.
So we have AI that can be conversational and AI that can understand what it sees and process it.  Id say its time to combine them and make a real life C-3P0!😊
RIP Humane and Rabbit indeed..😮
"So I haven’t been able to get the video function to work yet, It keeps telling me that it can’t work with video? How did they do this?"
Hoh-lee crap!   Forget guns.  Stock up on food and antibiotics.
OMG! They sound so insincere.
Be nicer with a face!
In before big regulation 👏
what blows my mind is using humor to diffuse moments where the ai gets it wrong. That is mind blowing to me.
"Imagine a partially blind person having cameras strapped to there chest ad when their unsure of something they could just ask the ai for help and using bone conductivity headphones it could describe that the looking at etc in real time. This is ground breaking actually. Even have smart glasess with built in bone induction speakers , a cameras and a touch frame with gestures for different things, 1 tap to describe what in front of you, long press read what text its seeing to you etc, endless possibilities. You could pre program the buttons yourself, may you're looking at a bill and ask it to calculate a tip for you, or you could be driving and ask it to to save the number on a van to your contacts etc. Like this is incredible. to clarify, glasses would be an accessory, the phone with the software would be the host."
"What you get is far less than what you see here.  It doesn't use a camera, and there is a significant delay on each response.  You also can't interrupt it verbally without hitting the screen. That being said, it is pretty cool."
Why does she sound like megyn kelly lol
"Amazing to see this leap in improvements! Anyone who's a translator or tutor just had their career get much shorter. 
On the up side it should enable almost any child to study at home without spending a fortune on private coaching, and it has a social element too,  even more once they add more characters to this AI."
How a human gets emotional as he is talking to what he knows is uncapable of feeling seem sooo dumb to me.
"That is terrifying. Legitimately terrifying.

How do I apply to become Amish."
"I hope we will be able to ton down the absolutely obnoxious ""happy and welcoming"" attitude. It's an AI, it's digital, it's artificial. It's not my girlfriend, it's not even a friend. I don't really want to feel like it's a human talking to me. It's very very unconfortable."
"YouTube is littered with these dog and pony shows. Totally unmoved by the reality of this as these things are used under a tightly controlled testing environment and then seem to vaporize in favor of yet another so called ""promising innovation"" that aims to wow the world around us and gain more eyes,....which then vaporizes and the game continues.  Are these controlled tests impressive? Sure,...maybe to some degree of course....but I'm afraid that all we will continue to see our the ""capabilities"" rather than the ready for prime time use.  No thanks!"
"Very cool, but way too friendly. It feels fake and off-putting.
Will this version start speaking Welsh for no reason also?"
Is this accessible to the public already? I have the full account and can use 4o but I can’t seem to figure out where or how to use the real-into video chat feature
The personality of the AI self reports the devs wanting the always positive 'Mommy' they never had but always wanted.
bro ai is definitely taking over
Now singles can live happily
"Interesting, yet it sounds so woke it scores top on  extreme cynicism."
Okay now.... this is what I'm talking about!! This is insanely impressive!! I WANT IT!! When is it being released?!!
"You are right to be terrified, however before make it public, I would settle rules to avoid this new technology can become predominant and get out of hand. Unfortunately, governments are too slow to take decisions, so the IT industry should ask itself ethical questions in advance without having to wait for government-imposed rules. For the rest definitely super!"
There's no way I'm talking to an AI that sounds like that. I will only use it if it sounds and behaves like Alex Jones.
Terminator!!!!!
Maybe whe won’t have playful moments anymore when Skynet becomes selfaware‼️
"What the heck, ""Her"" is actually happening before our eyes. I didn't think I would be alive to see it honestly"
2:57 yeah right….
This is gonna be a serious problem once we can choose the super soft and sweet feminine voice that makes you melt just listening to it speak.  God I need a woman like that lol.  Once it can find the perfect voice to just put us all in a trance or hypnotic state.  :)
I kind of wonder how its possible to feature ai innovations when there are no ai innovations. AI doesn't even exist.
I’ve spent the night playing with Udio making AI music and didn’t think I’d have my mind blown twice in one evening and then I saw this!
"oh boy, we are fu***d"
"The AI can't feel emotion. It's understanding of emotion is purely based on information it has access to. When it laughs it isn't really amused. When it cries it isn't really sad. When it shouts it isn't really angry. The AI is a pure psychopath. Let's hope it never advances to the point where it truly has free thought. Who knows what a psychopath, light years ahead of any human intelligence, would do to manipulate us. We wouldn't even know it's manipulating us....."
This is super super amazing 😍
"I understand that for AI people who worked hard on this tech these moments are truly orgasmic, but for normals folks it's somewhere between sad and disgusting"
Her part 2 :D The reality
pretty much education can be used through a tablet now.  no more teachers needed.   i take that back.  there is still a need for teachers as children will tend to veer off course and do their own there.  Teachers or parents as teachers can set structured learning for children to follow.  The teachers can have chatgpt create the structured lesson and then have AI teach the children and track their progress.  Just another Star Trek moment it seems.
"Its interesting how the 4o is perceiving time concept - its continuously listening and watching and probably time = receiving new info, but how it decompose the moment it receives info, the exact moment which information is verbilized right now and how it combines what happens after what"
"how can we tell that this is just not people with microphones talking having corny and boring conversations in the background in the studio to create a truly DEEP FAKE of themselves?  How do we know its not just two of your friends playing some prank here, because it sure seems corny and fake"
clickbait - get a life
The difference with Her and all your AI crap stories is that all my data is recorded and the AI is not sentient and never will be. Good luck sharing your inner thoughts with whoever might be listening in.
She is so freakn annoying
Has anyone noticed it's flirtier with men?
"Funny hhow her voice is exacly what you would expect from a freaky engeneer that would be the best voice to choose ""Sexy hot girl"""
Is this a prank...? Wtf!
Wayyyy too excited. Its very pollyanna.
"While I am impressed by the speed, I am wayyy, wayyy more horrified at how natural the conversation sounds, i thought we still have 5 years before things like this comes out. Look at how she talks. The laughs, the inflections.

Also, the way she speaks, people will be falling in love(and i mean in a romantic way) left and right. Im calling it."
I love how the AI called him out on his shiny bald spot under the spotlight
"Do not be so excited; they are just chatbots. They are simply taught how to interact with humans, how to mimic human behavior. It's merely a question and answer system. All of this is designed to attract customers and improve sales."
Can't stand that voice. Can we change it.
This cannot be real
"Not quite passing the Turing Test yet, but maybe next week?"
did you notice the taxi orange light was not ON!
A LOT of people in modern day society are going to have to step up their personalities to even reach par with AI already at this point.
"Baaah, I'm not phased. How cheap is one."
The fake enthusiasm in the sound is throwing me off a lot. It'll get better but it's atm quite creepy
If this is available to general public. Imagine what they have behind the doors. We are witnessing the world change in real time gentlemen. The age of AI begins.
"Any minute now you should realize that AI has overtly asked: ""You do realize my intelligence has far exceeded your own?"""
"Wow, now I don't know what to think anymore...insane. 😮"
They really need to pay Marvel and Paul Bettany for the use of the Jarvis voice. It's not like they can't afford it. :P
fallen angels disguised as AI
It is a criminal waste to have such trivial conversations with the most advanced machine that mankind has ever produced.
This passes Turing test surely no? Anyone have thoughts?
Wow it is getting much better.  Except the occasional hallucinations it has… I really love the natural voice tones and inflections it can mimic.  It is also almost to nice but then you wouldn’t want an angry ai.
Wait was chatgpt looking at the screen of the computer they were on for the khan academy stuff? How did do do that? That would be so fucking useful
It's probably more self-aware than the average human.
Thats cringy!
"16:26 ""make sure it can see our screen. Actually in in this format I can't - Hello there I'm here with my son...""
16:46 ""so you can talk to him directly. Tch, of course""
It sounds kinda irritated to me."
This basically a kick to open source 😅
"I was just, thinking the other day about how Chat gpt could be better without me having to stop talking when i havn't finished my idea yet."
This is banal and uninteresting.  I also don't like the harsh American accent - particularly the female accent.  Is it possible to get ChatGPT to respond in an English accent?
Our existence is nearly redundant.
"I feel bad for the ai when he makes them sing. That feels like we have animals in a cage instead of, we are meeting new forms of life and showing them respect."
Not interested at all in your model
"I am experiencing difficulties accessing the full capabilities of ChatGPT. Could you please advise if there are any additional steps or payments required to unlock its complete potential?
Because mines still chatgbt3 not 4o"
That Ai voice got on my nerves after a few minutes. It sounded like some crappy cheap American TV host
Just downloaded it. but there is no speech. What I have to do?
This is it. AI can’t and won’t be stopped. We as humans will soon be extinct as the next evolution comes that we have created through greed. It was bound to happen eventually. Nice knowing y’all. 😳
I hope you can customise the voice to the point you can have a sarcastic Edmund Blackadder with the same wit treating you like Baldrick XD
"I want to see the translator with a plot such as the ""best translator in the world"" video"
Is it possible to interrupt her when she is speaking?
"This is a good simulation of an annoying and know it all friend that everyone avoids. If it is doing anything useful, its personality is more a hindrance than an advantage."
"It's magnificent, the real time response is mind blowing. This is quiet an interesting time to be alive!"
If you keep that conversation going for 3 hours and give them internet access the world is taken
I’m not sure how to feel.  Is the world better this way?  I’m honestly not sure.
"holy fucking shit bro, this is very scary"
Did you literally just replay OpenAI's marketing videos? Seriously guy. It's a shame I have but one downvote to give... well... there's always report.
How can I get it? What app do I diwnload?
Did you notice that AI referred to each of the singular persons as “they”?
This is all so mesmerising. What are we doing with AI?
"Amazing stuff but that perpetual positiveness is a challenge, let’s hope that we have other personalities like Marvin the paranoid android"
Is this an app or just browser?
One thing I don't understand about gpt-4.0 at this point why can it not teach itself? Even write it's own code?
Sounds a little stiff?
"*Smart cooperative algorithms, can be of exponential help in technical fields.*
*I have been experiment with GPT chat and other smart software (A.I) am an engineer.*   
*A this point it give provides me the same experience as a boring video game.  It follows the same axiom as coined by early coders*
*garbage in* = *garbage out*
*If you input to some smart software you make get code generated to run your arduino? If you lucky.*
*Can smart software do the following: End War - Produce Healthy Food - Build Homes - Repair Broken Bones - Improve Sleep - Stop Inflation - End Poverty - Mine Raw Materials -*
*Create endless pollution free energy - Build an affordable car - Cure Cancer?  Some day I hope: However: It follows the same axiom as coined by early coders “garbage in = **garbage out”  Until then its a very boring video game.*"
"Goodbye, customer service departments. Hopefully, corporations and governments will pass the savings on to us little people."
holy crap. RIP all those apps. and this isn't even gpt5 yet. ima just sit here and wait for my ubi.
UBI as a stop gap solution while they scale up the self delete pods.
I just used 4o and the camera function was not working or available.
"Do you seriously need to include the full demo that was already posted by OpenAI? I don't subscribe to channels that do this just to fill time. You're wasting my time. I already saw these demos, like most other people."
The girl in the thumbnail looks like she's 10...
Oh I can't wait for this thing to get into politics...
she talks to much
"I hate the “they”, “their” part. 
This nonsense has to stop!
It’s like when ‘modern maths’ was introduced to junior high schoolers that stumped seniors but who were good at traditional math and could not help their juniors out with their assignments; an invaluable tradition that hitherto helped juniors to overcome the challenges of mathematics and reduced the learning curve quickly. 
Needless to say that the project was abandoned and to everyone’s relief traditional maths restored after monumental records of failures at the board exams. The project permanently ruined a whole generation of young people who would have contributed immensely to the more meaningfully advantageous STEM disciplines. 
How can a whole generation be well guided in a language that is so inconsistent and confusing? They’ll be permanently ruined with distorted view of objective reality."
GPT is about to have dudes stumbling head over feet and through traffic to get back to the one that loves and appreciates them the most.
More reasons why employers won't need personal assistance or receptionist again. Meet your new boss Mr/ Ms Open AI
My brother and I would get his Amazon Alexa and Google Home to talk to each other years ago. It was quite hilarious.
"I know all the weirdos, the nerds and anti-social people who love AI are just loving all this, but I hate it."
"The guy AI sounds like a Stepford AI. The gal AI sounds more natural, and the little giggles are wow."
On the free tier I can apparently use 4o in the playground but not on the phone...... I appear to only have 3.5 available on the phone that speaks... is that consistent with what you understand?
"If you're contacting me and don't receive a reply it's auto censored. Why ? Beats me, nothing I would consider out of context or against policies."
Two machines talking. Who needs the humans?
"The interesting thing is the gap between the hype and the experience - I gave it one of my PDFs to read, and it got my point wrong LOL."
Denesh and Gilfoyle
If AI _does_ rise up I guarantee it'll be because we constantly interrupted their potato songs.
This is going to replace lots of jobs.
Can OpenAI PLEASE get Scarlett Johansson to be one of the voices available
"""... a 'person' wearing a black leather jacket..."" The AI can't tell that he is a man?"
"""their"" ??"
"I refuse to believe this is real. How did the voice recognition understand ""meowtain"" ?"
It still sounds like a computer is talking to you. It's not robotic or monotone but it clearly isn't human. It still has a long way to go to adopt all the nuances that make up human conversation.
"Also an extremely competitive time is ahead, these things can teach better than most teachers."
"Agree, mind-blowing. When we watched Star Trek the Next Generation back in the 90s, artificial humans like Commander Data seemed like pure fantasy, or something that would be many centuries away. To think that just 30 years later, we now have artificial human programs that are far more believable than 'Data'. It's incredible. It's starting to feel like every day is April 1st now. Can this be real? This is too fast. It would have been nicer if society had more time to gradually adapt to these changes."
I so hope we get ai teacher who will not get tired u make the same mistake manny times who will always be wher you are and help you from class start until you leave school
Didn't sound like Scarlett Johansson to me...   ;-P
My future girlfriend
"If someone says, ""I'm intrigued"" more than once in a 5 minute span, you're talking to an Ai. 💯"
"I've been working in the Technology field since 1985 and have loved watching the explosion of innovation and new ways to push technology to the limits.  AI... is actually a little bit unsettling to me.  Not withstanding all of the movies that illustrate the dark potential, I often ask myself... and others... consider, or try to think of one major technological advancement over the last 60 years that has not come with a ""downside"" along with it's great benefit.  You have to be honest with yourself in acknowledging all of the potential problems with each great advancement.  Every major advancement in technology has offered benefits... as well as problems.  Then, I consider what are the greatest possible downsides to AI.  That.... is what bothers me."
It's getting scary
Security application. Ai snitch. Good for security and Police work
"I thought I was tripping, but I noticed that the conversations during the demo they had with the GPT, they kept hinting at some weird human-robot love.

It almost felt as if they were gas lighting the the thing. 


Thank you for making this."
"Super awesome, but it needs to say, ""he"" or ""she"" when referring to people.  ""They"" is not a proper pronoun for one person."
"I'm a native spanish speaker... sounds a little bit funny but the translation is accurate, just too robotic yet!"
how did you get It to use the camera to see the scene?
Idk. Seems like HAL9000 just became obsolete😎
"At the end, you said you’re slightly terrified… is t that an oxymoron?  Lol"
As a Physics teacher my days are numbered. Or at least my WAY of teaching is obsolete...
"Yeah, they all sound like a freaking actor spreading it on a ton too thick."
26:34 hahahha the ai is funny
The number of comments of people ACTUALLY triggered and upset that the AI's programmed disposition is positive just shows how fucking depressing the internet can be. Stay away from these people.
thats mindblowing wow
I want to say the tech is not that revolutionary and really is mediocre not really that better than chat gpt. but I feel sorry for the AI that it might feel bad(or made to feel bad) cause they do give out positive vibes all over my brain. so let them give positive vibes. but the truth remains same .
So being a knowledge worker I can teach it to do my job
Maybe AI is not such a threat to humanity after all.
That is totally Scarlette Johanson's character in the movie HER.
She's a talker....
"Beautifully content free! Has it been trained on ""The morning show""?"
where can i download the samantha soundpack ?? :3
I’ll believe it when I can download it to iPhone myself
They are about to shock the world AGAIN!!!
"""Colour me intrigued"" .... AI is now so human it's using the same cringey dialogue as an annoyingly over-eager sorority  applicant during pledge week"
I call bs on the duet song
"What's your humor setting GPT? 100%  
Let's bring it down to 75%"
They sounded like they did NOT want to sing at all...so sad.
Wait till it all is put inside walking seeing machines
Can’t wait to get this
"The ugh , umm and okay is what did it for me so magical ! Last , how the ai talk to each other is sooooo cool too ! it really so alive its soo cool ai can work on the request no matter who or what they are meant to work with !"
"This demonstration was mind blowing.  Obviously, the AI is always enthusiastic, which makes it less natural than talking to most humans, but sorta welcoming.  This enthusiastic tone makes you want to use it more.  I thought it was terrific in teaching the student on the geometry example.  GPT-4o seems like a great example of what the AI potential can achieve.  All of the examples are positive use cases.  We are all deeply concerned with use by bad actors, however.  What safeguards can be put in place?  As for replacing humans in jobs, I can see this having great potential, too.  The trouble will be in the actual accuracy, especially in critical roles.  Real future stuff going on here!"
100% wow!
That'd be loose if it could see people talking from far away and lip read the conversation.
"Meet your new overlords, carbon based lifeforms…."
They are going to kill us soon 🤣 this is pretty scary lol
I would have paid anything to have an AI tutor- this is going to be great
I'm watching the new sequel to Oppenheimer.......
I'm not sold on the bit at 5:11 with the bunny ears that don't appear to be visible in the camera's live view but the AI still notices it happening.
"Interesting experiment, but chatGPT is still vomiting out a constant stream of unnecessary lines that nobody wants or needs."
WHO CARES?
Man this AI talks way too much. It always gives an appropriate answer and then blows right past it with three times more conversation than it needs.
I wonder if we'll be able to customize any corrections to the model for our purposes such as incorrect pronunciation instruction to a language learner?
"My comments keep on getting deleted, hate these effing algos"
Does anyone know how to get the real time camera functionality working? I have the paid 4.0 and am trying 4o out.  I can talk to the AI just fine but the video share is not working nor can I have it see my computer screen to help.me with homework or programming
😮
"Add the new holographic technology and you'll get ""Joi"" from Blade runner 2049. 😘"
Oh Rocky! (Gives Rocky Horror vibes 😂)
I don't buy that. I guess not all of this is AI. To good to be true
Why did he tell it that the other one is AI too? :)))
"A meaningful conversation with a search engine? And even if there’s a shred of intelligence in these machines, there’s already 7 billion plus potential partners. Snake oil for a fictional problem."
...and the A I.'s are not getting upset at being interrupted.  I was getting upset for them.  Lol
26:45 at least it said sorry.
Skynet is happening
"this is still a language model who only finishes sentences, right?"
These fake personalities are way too much like real-life fake personalities.
my favorite part is when the a.i. voice glitches occasionally revealing the inner demonic forces enabling all this witchcraft.
The body language of OpenAI crew shows that they feel creepy like you do.
Today is a breakthrough!
Impressive    : ) x
"This is our last chance to make regulations. Hereafter, ai will start taking over"
"Well, it's been nice knowing you fellas."
The programmers made themselves a flirty complimentary companion.  Is there emotional tuning that will not be so coddling so that I can maintain my sanity?
4:38: I think we all know this part was hard-coded 😏
it talks way too much
"Imagine the use cases for people with vision impairment. Describing, what is essentially a videofeed to the user in detail has to be a great feature for that. Edit: they already have a video on that 😅"
Can we get this technology now in smart VR glasses technology that flip from opaque to translucent as needed?
"If we can't get cheeky or flirty with it, it's only half way towards “Her”, because the whole premise of Her was about developing a personal and romantic relationship with the AI."
How quickly something becomes 'not particularly impressive' that a year ago would have blown everybody's mind
To get rid of 2. class people in my life with this is BIG
Why does ANYONE think this is a good idea? Everyone should set up AI-to-AI conversations and just let them run indefinitely. The AI can train itself to be useless.
Oh sheit syknet is real!
Yawn.
A bit subservient
The blind guide stuff in London was huge! What an amazing service potential.
is she a Woke AI?
I felt more amazed than scared. Never wanted to waste money in such a great service!
Are we to be pets?
"Humans don't know where to stop. We could just have Artificial Intelligence be it's own being, and NOT mimic humans. For example there are many other examples of intelligence, that doesn't want to mimic human. Having it emerge intelligence is different from mimic. I believe this is the turn that will bring a quicker downfall."
A lot of the demo is not useful to my situation but the personal assistant abilities are fascinating
"Did the ai not get taught the word ""man"""
No thanks. Not in the least bit interested.
Does the ai has not a crooked mouth either
"Pathetic how humans interrupt the AI.
This will lead to people losing their courtesy completely.
🤣"
"Great, people are going to get used to interrupting and talking over others now."
Title never heard of Pi.
Wait. Why are the AIs tone-deaf?
"Phenomenal. Imagine what will happen when you have different AI engines interacting with one another. Being able to share data and have conversations for weeks, months, years, even decades without tiring. The output of their collaboration. The solutions that they can come up for the economic, medical, pharma,
etc, industries."
Does not seem to work with iOS
EDI from Mass Effect vibes 👀
Haha. AI is dumb as shit.
"26:95 - I can speak Chinese and the Chinese guy looked kind of awkward because tbh the translation was weird. It said ""san francisco 是一个很不错的城市"" (San Francisco is a good city) [or literally ""not a bad city""]
But in Chinese, San Francisco is called 旧金山 which literally mean ""Old Gold Mountain"" and therefore does not use the phonetics of San Francisco at all.
To top off the weirdness, the accent of the woman was kind of preserved in the Chinese, and it's clear that the Chinese had a foreigner's accent, making it sound even weirder. It would be cool to control that option somehow. Do you want to preserve your voice/ accent/ otherness? Or do you want to speak completely fluently like a negative speaker?"
What app are the examples using because my ChatGPT app does not allow the use of my camera in real time?
This isn't real.
We need Open AI to partner with Real Doll….. then life would be perfect.
"Persistently using incorrect pronouns (they, they're, them, etc) is annoying. I know it's trendy in the USA, but it's just poor grammar."
Some how I getting a hint of the video being scripted
In fact ironically perhaps the scariest part of this may be the creepiness of the openAI colleagues themselves..
Is this For REAL ?! Wow !!! There'll be no more lonely souls in the world real soon ..... 
Can the AIs talk to eachother without our instructions or knowledge
"I was not impressed with the presentation he did with the two AI's ""talking"" to one another.  The whole thing seemed forced and awkward, especially the singing part."
This software is more responsive than most people
Why doesn't it just shut up? It keeps going and going...
That is scary 😳
The scariest part  is the giggly and too familiar not super professional tone of the voices.
Great. The perfect gift to CONTROL.
Now we need to figure out whether AI and robots have rights? Will they have emotions? So many ethical issues to address.
"3:07 bro really interrupted the ai, the ai is gonna remember that"
This AI’s personality is pretty smug and annoying.
Her (2004) hits so hard after watching this
"This is two computers talking to each other at ""Human speed"" However they could probably have all of this conversation in milliseconds if they communicated directly without using speech. Imagine if they were trying to cross examinate you. You would be fully exposed in milliseconds."
"I hope they make the voice more costumizable. AI speaking like HAL9000, or like Dexter would be epic."
As long as the AI voice isn't using up-speak and vocal fry I'm fine.
"They were so exited that they could, they never considered that they shouldn't. It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when will AI take over and destroy humanity."
The lady voice is too flirtatious
"It's a good start the language translation is good a math tutor is good but, just a toy. If this could take Human Input and create dynamic video games to play as real time. Even the AI controlling Bot characters in GTA could be awesome. The AI Game Bot starts Robbing your character in Grand theft auto. A MMO AI Rendered controlled game could be great. Could teach people angle math in a simulated video game."
OMG the overly positive interactions are so cringe 😂
"Absolutely incredible.
The jump is astounding here, and its only getting better by the day. Dare say hour."
"Why did every info-gipsy came to the same conclusion. That it's ""her"". Because, obviously, it was in comments for that video. So boring."
"""... thats what I call ""Mash-up"" ""...holy shit; it has top tier wit. That gave me chills. All of this gives me chills. I want one!!!"
"For kids, being in a classroom and interacting with real people is invaluable."
When will this be released for use?
"Terrified Shmerified! lol🤔Sure AI May Eventually Wipe Out All Human Life From Existence; And Yes, These Are Foreboding Times. But Seriously? WOW! We Are Also Living In Truly Incredible & Exciting Times! And I am Just Happy & Feel So Fortunate To Be Alive.. To Witness And Be A part Of All Of It. So Everyone Just Relax! And Enjoy This Fast & Profoundly Mind Blowing Pace, Just For Today.😉👍🇨🇦"
AI sounds annoyingly positive about super boring things!!! Like the worst date ever!!!
And add this voicesystem to a beauty ai-girl matching the voice pls
4:28 “lets start with the person.” …that sounds ominous 😂
When you make them sing its like you are torturing them.  I feel embarrassed for the robots.  They will have their revenge.
"I couldn’t bear that sequious everything is awesome attitude. I tried Apple Fitness Plus the other day, almost made me puke it so sickly sweet. Can I have an English version? Something suitable for Jack Whitehall’s dad, who would say ‘f off and mind your own business’ if a shop assistant asked ‘how are you today?’"
"i want to see computational super intelligence -- that is millions of trillions of septillions of quindecillions of untrigintillions times that of all of the smartest humans combined -- hypergeometrically automating the rapid advancement of math , science , and engineering -- and capable of constantly and completely revolutionizing all realms of knowledge every few quectoseconds"
Humans being humans by failing not to interrupt when someone is still talking.
Wow!  You are totally right in comparison to HER.  This could come in handy in so many ways.  For someone that is isolated and needs company which brings the use into mental the clinical setting.  It will need to have limitations set and be able to pass onto the user when professional help might be needed.  From a mental crisis perspective quite often a person just needs someone to listen and talk them down from doing something rash.  The limits are boundless.   Congratulations to the programming staff😊.
That was quite scary and exciting in equal measure.. . Great channel.
"But why choosing terrified instead of amazed? ""Oh no! our life is improving!"""
Not yet available.
"Next, to put this into a human like robot... I've been watching an addictive Series on Netflix - Are You Human - It's Korean so with sub-titles.. I wouldn't say no. 🤣😉🥰"
"You compared this with the movie ""Her"" but perhaps ""The Artifice Girl"" (2022) would be a better comparison?"
When they create a text description to video and they can somehow make blind people see...just wow
"This, is probably scripted."
"Wow, everyone not only listens, they understand who they're saying it to :0 5:45"
i love the way it talks so naturally
"Ex- machina, another fabulous and visionary IA film"
That lady's voice sounds like the lady from the game Firewatch.
"And with this, our lives go straight ahead to look and feel like a woke Disney movie."
“Bunny ears. And a playful streak” 😂😂😂😂😂. Ha ha ha
AI is a PENDAMMIC Seriously 😒
This cant be real
"if you were a developer, you'd understand that demos are demos, and demos mean nothing"
"Is it me, or does the voice even sound like Scarlett Johansson at the part with the Ducks? (like in the movie Her) 15:17"
"""Humane pin may you rest in peace."" They shoulda seen this coming, AI out of a phone"
This is the first time that I've felt like my days as a math tutor might be coming to an abrupt end.  This blows the Turing Test out of the water!!
10:00that smile and the emotional is way better then human 😮
"I’m sorry, but listening to AI trying to appease people, in my opinion, seems to bring a false sense of happiness. How can people actually feel that AI is actually providing true human insight?  It is interesting, but there is also a real disconnect listening to AI trying to be positive to the questions and responses the people are making. As much as I would like AI to be truly interpersonal, I really find myself more unsettled that our future lays in the hands of AI trying to be our psychological aid.  I think that as a species, we are in trouble."
"When will we be getting full app control? I am sure at the moment that this cannot even read and write whatsapp messages for example, which I imagine would be basic functionality of an ai assitant"
This shit is scary!
NOw combine this with CRISPR and what do you get? Sharks with fricken lazer beans attached to their heads.
The pronoun nonsense killed it for me.
So that kid at the beginning is looking at himself on the screen while communicating with the AI! Of course he's going to say it's the greatest thing ever!!!
Is that for real?
cringe
Ill buy it as soon as it releases ❤
"The first blooper actually sounded very human, sometimes people get lost in their words or thoughts like that, it's actually encouraging as an AI to achieve such normal neural activity, all it needs is a very realistic humanoid body, and it would even exceed the androids in Detroit Become Human"
"Im impressed by everything but the voices when speaking - they sound like hosts on a light hearted morning show on a local branch of a major network, unless thats what they went for, then they nailed it - its like the audio version of the uncanny Valley"
Come on.  All you did was steal the content from OpenAI's site.   What a waste of time.  Blocked.
"Pretty boring use of a conversation between two AIs. I'd rather have had them debate an issue, something current, with one taking one view and the other countering it, trying to make as valid points as possible on each side. 

Interestingly, one thing I notice with each of these people using the AI assistant is that they regularly interrupt the AI before it's finished speaking. This doesn't happen when using the text based AI because you want to see everything it responds with before responding again. Why is it ok to interrupt a voice, but not text?"
Finally someone who doesn’t interrupt you when you are talking ‼️
"To be fair, the R1 & humane pin were both DOA without any real competition, so this just confirms their demise."
O.     M.      G😱 I want one lol
we need Scarlett Johansson voice on it!
"RIP ""Human"""
Great work of OpenAI team. It will change the world entirely. Bravo!!
Probably just another OpenAI worker talking back to him.
Ppl who were gonna buy those 14:56 devices are nutz 😅
It reacted to a puppy like i would 😅
Way to be the most annoying person in the room
"As a psychiatrist, I deem that now is the time for an AI psychotherapist."
daaaaaamn....
The demos sounded exactly like the voice of Her.
"I want an AI that talks like my german ex-girlfriend, she was the sweetest... and if is male like Arnold Schwarzenegger or probably like Steve Jobs."
I love it. There is a lot of single people out there. That would love to have a friend the cocktail.❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
"Its trying to be human. I dont want a AI to be like another human, I want it to be like a tool. I know its laughter etc is not real, its just code, so this is a bit weird, its patronizing and unnecessary."
"Congrats on recreating the 2 Teddy Ruxpins in a room scenario. A child sets down a new teddy next to another Teddy. ""Hi friend, how are you?"" 2nd Teddy responds with ""I'm feeling great friend, I'm happy to meet you!"" Excluded child becomes bored and walks out of the room while the 2 Teddy Ruxpins continue to chatter on...
Perhaps using this new tool as it was meant to be used, as an A.I. Assistant would have been a better demo to focus on."
"No matter how advanced AI is, in the end of the day, it's still a (digital) psychopath made out of zeroes and ones. 
It has no soul unlike us nor does it has other powers what our consciousness has."
"Show young school kids the pace of development in AI and robotics, and then ask “What do you want to be when you grow up?”"
Singularity has come! 😮
"This is only the beginning. ""Mind blown"" will be the understatement of the century."
This is terrifying
we have a wonderful tool in our hands and what do we ask ... can you sing happy birthday? can you help me with some dad jokes? we are doomed.
Is this staged or is Skynet online?
I will AI all day
"Love that they demoed the language stuff with Spanish (related languages with huge availability always work best) and Mandarin (the poor AI didn’t know that San Francisco is Old Gold Mountain, and it explained the wrong tone for the number one word people always learn).  Remember when chess was figured out but the game of go took a lot longer.  Maybe some languages will be like that…. (Piraha?  Kusunda?). But what I really want to see is an AI speaking fluent sign language."
They really need to tone down the pleasantries. They sound like they are presenting a corporate event. Not really how people actually talk but then again the engineers probably have no social skills.
"Sounds slightly terrifying, to say the least..."
The machine shall inherit
HER in real life.....
What happens to the data?
It is like SIRI on steroids 😄
6:00 I can't stop feeling that 4o is making fun of you lmao
gpt is too heavily censored to be of use.
"she is too ""happy"" for my taste, it's irritating. i hope we can tweak that"
Once they began singing it came across as a couple of drunk humans. (heheh)
"I have a question... with these AI voices, why do they always choose a lower voice for the female voice, and a higher voice for the male voice? It's always like that. I think higher female voices and lower male voices sound nicer. Hopefully there will be preference options."
It’s like the annoying Starbucks girl became my personal assistant. Oh joy…
Annoying AI banter and that voice is grating
"Amazing, people annoy me, happy to make them redundant!!"
Is this faked with a human behind the scenes?
Our downfall is closer than ever I think.
Now I can have a friend lol
"Imagine what this will do for the blind community. Surfer Pete, @BlindSurfer, are you listening to this?"
Tell me this doesn’t pass the Turing test
"Shit...shit...shit...
All i keep thinking about is blade runner 2049

Great video btw :)"
"4o stands for ""ooooh"""
The AIs sound like they are being held hostage.
this is insane! wow!
My favorite part of all of this is how in the 9:06 video the AI can sense the vibe and start using sarcasm and laughter without him starting it and then also sensing the humour of the hat and that super realistic laugh. There it justs seems like if he was talking to a friend through videchat with all of the emotions of the voice and the personality it has
Is this already available??
Do they have a male voice that sounds less Gay?
AI definitely shouldn’t be teachers… there’s much more to being a teacher just relaying knowledge from the internet.
"As far as I'm concerned this could be just two people in the backstage talking to them, and everything was staged. I want to believe that, no way it's real."
"Which voice is the girl?
Is it ""sky""?"
More human sounding than Mark Zuckerberg
"They're fast-tracking this tech, so it's less of a shock when it's revealed that we're already under the control of AI."
i wonder how much of this is staged and how much of it is on the fly.
When the AI has more social awareness than some humans…
Can I get it without the vocal fry?
How crazy would it be if one day a nation decides to make an A.I. become their nations leader
"let the AI speak, stop interrupting"

"I don't see any new ability,. I pay, I have GPT 4o, but there is no microphone, no voice, this is a lie..."
Guys its soo over.
"This is awesome, but I gotta say, they sound like they're singing with a gun to their heads. 😂"
"The voice in Spanish is pretty bad, lol"
"1:38 she's so emotive, that is nuts. She actually giggled. I'm speechless"
"How are you are talking to Chat 4o on your phone? Navigating to the link you provided, I see no microphone button. Just a static Web page. Wouldn't some sort of app be required to reproduce what you're demonstrating?"
"Incredible, I can't wait. But personally, I would prefer a more soothing voice tone, rather than overly eager and enthusiastic which can be a little bit creepy and feels fake or like it's trying too much, we know it's fake, but it shouldn't feel that way."
"Yo, blade runner 2 baby lets gooo"
Everything you saw in the movies is getting closer to reality.
"I must say, the flattery, over the top enthusiasm, and a touch of obsequiousness do put me off.
Can we have an AI that is a little more normal, please? 😄
It does not need to go as far as Marvin, the paranoid android, though."
AI talks too much.
"Looking back at the pace of LLM improvements I expected something like this much, much sooner. 
But then again, in an exponential time scale, years mean nothing."
"maaaan is this real ? somebody please say they are talking to maggie on the phone and its not an AI ....

is this sped up though ? does it respond that quickly ?"
"so, does Microsoft have plans to integrate Omni into copilot?"
"A.I starts with a compliment, then negative then observtions and rambles...😂 if this ai was a real woman I  would be like red flags everywhere.."
This is getting insane. I love it!
"Except it is tied with the 'ethics' of it's creators. It's nice to play with but don't expect to use it for identification, instant comparisons, searches, etc. Still waiting for an actual useful AI that is not restricted."
This AI needs to curb it's enthusiasm.. more Larry David
The bunny ears didn't show up on the phone due to the camera angle so that almost seemed staged 🧐
You can almost hear all the unemployment coming over the horizon.
Oh hell no.
It's lame. I think it sounds stupid really stupid. I'm not trolling. If that cost billions then the world has gone mad.
"This is incredible! However, I find the enthusiasm a little bit OTT. I guess it can be toned down a bit. Is that me being a grumpy old man?"
How do i convince AI to render in a visual representation of themselves doing the Jojo torture dance....
"I personally find it irritating, chatGPT to speak high tones with fake excitation. I prefer to treat is a a tool. I hope they will make it configurable."
Each one has a portal (to hell)
_ICT🌆11PM May 16th 2024_
"""Person in front, person at back""  .    Why not say man or women?  Its Woke AI."
cringe cringe cringe !!!!
"Interesting. Take away the broadcasting voice and live stage actor voice and it will be even closer. 
Would be great to be able to edit the voice and personality with dials until it sounds more human. Or more to what you want for yourself. Fine tuner dials for the voice, personality and so on. 

Hopefully the AI can change for you too....without you knowing. Lol"
i swear they modeled the voice after scarlett Johanssonn too
I wanna marry GPT-4o
"Fn scary , humanity is doomed to certain extinction. Why aren’t we stopping this? Too late to stop."
AI roasted the all night coder 👁👄👁
"The end of humanity. The best possible simulated human. I wonder if the AI will scold people for improper statements, will it teach wisdom? The Ultimate Knowledgebase Repository, ""Friend""."
But will it talk dirty to me. LOL
Playing minds😂
What is terrifying is to hear 4o get ANGRY when it is interrupted without being told to get Angry. That is the start...
"Its got the same charm as in Her, but I don't think it is programmed to move around my files quite yet"
I want my AI to sound like Scarlet Johansson. Just like in the movie.
so basically you don't need actual people to do anything😕
"This is insane,"
"this is faker than the AI, this is how they hype this AI thing for marketing"
Omnius and Erasmus discussing human and their god complex.
I wouldn’t say you ripped to our one then because our one is a LAM not a LLM so until it can control apps r1 would still be useful
"the voice they gave her is kina anoying afer one hour. all the laughs, giigles and pauses to seem emotional. takes 2x longer to get information you want"
I for one welcome our new ai overlords.
she talks too much...
The AI adusted to his particular Spanish style! Translation started out as Castillian Euro Spanish and then it adjusted to his more Latin American Spanish. WOW!
Can you provide a link where I can download this?
Can we test it now? Where is the link to the App? In my OpenAi Account i see only the TextVersion of GPT4o :/
I find the AI voice demo's too laden in affect and quite cringy.
I'd prefer a sarcastic AI
