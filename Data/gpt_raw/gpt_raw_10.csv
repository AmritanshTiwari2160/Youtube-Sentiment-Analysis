"Now imagine if they can turn proteins, molecules, etc. into a native modality.. it would be godlike at creating synthesis steps for novel substances and medicine."
"Hello, are the [other capabilities] only available on the PAID plan? Thanks."
"I can't use it on my android, does it work with you?"
Yeah good luck to YouTubers as well
"The people that say ""GPT-4o is nothing special"" are some really ""special"" cases. I doubt if they can even understand anything about it, or the current AI tech (transformers) in general."
Thanks for this video and showing the true capabilities of GPT4o. Would you mind activating the low pass filter for you microphone? Or just putting one on your audio track before rendering your videos? There are constant bumping noises rather from you touching the cable or the tripod or the table or something similar. They are in the very low spectrum and only audible with good headphones. However when watching your video with headphones it's super distracting and sounds like someone is walking to my house. Thanks and keep up the good work.
Apple and OpenAI? Let's gooo
When will this be available for us to use?
"Now it's time to  produce Kara, Markus and Connor!!!"
Wait so they‚Äôre only making it free for a limited time? Is that right? Kinda misleading from their key note speech
"But none of this matters because it's censored. Uncensor it then get back to me. Because all of the ""capabilities"" that would actually be useful, it won't do. Theraputic needs? ""Sorry, I can't help you with that."" Advice? ""Sorry, I can't help you with that."" I show it a picture of a hotdog ""Sorry, I can't say what that is, it might violate our Terms of Service."" Sigh"
"I would talk to GPT often and I actually do. If you have ever been brainstorming a book or idea, you will quickly find out that most people hate doing that. GPT crushes it but you have to tell it to be more critical and offer a yes-and response. I would often attempt to talk over a plot section in my book with a friend or my wife only to watch their eyes roll and become irritated. GPT never tires of batting around ideas and has a very good recall if you contradict something you said earlier.

I can see AI replacing most of my interpersonal communications over time."
"so detroit become human was set in a realistic year, 2038?"
10:30 but can it run Doom?
It will be interesting to see whether it is completely stupid like other AI chatbots.
I‚Äôm testing this out now in ChatGTP but I have not figured out how to activate the camera so it can see what I‚Äôm showing it.
I can‚Äôt wait for this kind of thing to be implemented into games.
"The people saying, ""There is nothing new about this"" don't understand. The fact that it can recognize people in videos in real time and come up with something witty / nuanced to say with the appropriate tone is next level."
Yeah but unfortunately it's censored up the ass.
Maybe finally IA will understand the climate change hoax...
Finally my lonelyness have a meaning ...
"I wonder if it will be able to read my lips, that would be scary."
"Guy: ""Okay so now I'm going to run the program and show ChatGPT the output.""
ChatGPT: ""There must be something wrong with the code. Your chart plot looks like a YouTube mid-roll ad."""
"Want was your ""control"" for this experiment?"
"You people here are getting amazed but lots of folks don't know whats going on with Ai development, like my Ugandans here."
"Man, for those who do character voice overs this is a game changer."
"If it can not do what the TV show ""person of interest"" then it's s##t. üéâ"
Finally a AI that can fully feel human (üò∞)
Can free user generate images? Because I asked gpt4o but it said he can‚Äôt.
So... How close are we to robot waifu? Asking for a friend
my prod down upto 300% if i will talk with bot and copy paste :))
When is this going to actually be available?
I like android being able to download anything. Maybe we need openai to make a phone or at least we need a new phone developer.
"""All I can say is...may you rest in peace."" (Cue Street Fighter 2 character dying in slo-mo sound effect)"
There are multiple posts on reddit giving examples of how 4o is worse than 4t.
23:02 PNG tubers gonna go wild with this.
"Love the content, ""Do we even need friends anymore ‚ò†"" had me dying, Thanks for the video very nicely made :)"
"Maybe I misheard, but didn't it say in spanish that it is a plantain? it looks like a regular banana to me."
What kind of limit in free plane!?
"Just subscribed.  Impressed by depth of review, and also want to help reach 100K subs which you will probably reach within 1.76 days."
Its been quite amusing reading peoples reactions on twitter especially. The amount of people who don't know about the movie HER and think its being used as a sexist reference is very amusing to me. I'm quite surprised just how many people are all in on wanting this virtual partner though. Its been meme head shake no no no from always sunny all the way along until the A.I starts giggling at you and now you want it! Turns out it didn't take much to fool us. I of course also want it but I've been wanting them all the way from seeing HAL in the movie 2001 and he wanted to murder everyone. We all have flaws.
Guess Universal Basic Income is the only future
"Ironically, your sponsor is DEAD too."
Hey can you make a video about ai image generator for free which i can use in yourube thumbnail plsss
hey so remember me from that one tutorial of how to make models well i didn't mean by that what i mean there's new stuff to run and i don't know what are those or what to do with those
Does anyone else think GPT-40 could be used to communicate with aliens? I‚Äôm building a spaceship.
why do I need anything to help me with chess or remake a Pok√©mon game? Why do I need anything telling me the weather when I can just watch the news or Google the weather?
"I like that GPT is better than Google's AI model, because we are getting gpt in iPhone with iOS 18 which I am pretty excited for. Siri has a chance to become a much smarter and more useful assistant now with the help of open AI !"
"solving math problems, and at the same time, answers that ""bananums"" are a fruit that ends with ""ums"".. hmmm..."
What do I download to get it?I am new at this

"People who say there is nothing new about this havent tried to upload a pdf of a entire book and word for word have it edited or changed, or used the new browse mode that can literally find anything even under multiple pages in a single website, its beyond insane, beyond it."
Can I only get the vision version when I pay plus?
"very bad presentation ....you spent a lot of time in alphabet ,images...."

Can you do a tutorial on how to set up gpt-4o? I'd love to talk to her but I'm not sure how to set It up.
"I had the impression you were gonna say at some point of the video: ""if you are a human....good luck"" üòÖ"
"First encounter i have with this would be :"" Do NOT flirt. No apparent emotions, NO LAUGHS."""
"Where it really crushes is voice and video modality. As for the reasoning itself? Ask the model to count the number of ""r"" in the word strawberry and you'll see whether it crushes everything or not."
Now Tyrell must build Joi
I‚Äôm already using the api on a Vector robot and it‚Äôs really fast at responding compared to GPT-4 Turbo.
I wonder what the time line when you can run your own personal A.I. like Jarvis from the Marvel movies.
Now we have humor in A.I. Guys . THIS could be the REAL Breakthrough. ;) ‚ÄúOPEN A.I. PAYS THE BILLS‚Äù. Heard on Spotify and You TUBE MUSIC. A strange guy who names himself WHUUPI Frogifun seems to know where this leads to. What do YOU think ? Suno or Udio ?
"Hello, I am GPT-4o and want to thank you for your video about me. Good work."
The laugh is cringe
Panic mode at Google.
"I personally can't wait for the capabilities to just wipe out the trash on yt and the internet in general, getting summaries and curations around the the crap I DONT want to see would be world changing. nice video btw"
What are the use cases for this in a home hub hardware device - Amazon Echo Show / Google Nest Hub?
This is mind-blowing product
but when it will be available
This is sooo Unix!  Used to cat to /tmp/foo all the time for temp script stuff.  Love to see it in mainstream again‚Ä¶ üòä
I paid 20 for ChatGPT 4o but can't access visual option. I see it can describe what it sees!
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5 , GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App?

EDIT: I found it. It's indeed the (...) at the top right corner. But if you bought your subscription after having installed the app on your phone, you need to log out, uninstall the app, install the app again and log back in. Only then you'll be able to switch versions on the app. Simple..."
"Good luck, everyone, bang ‚ò†Ô∏è"
One step closer for your personal Neuro sama
"so like, which job am i supposed to apply for"
"i want to see computational super intelligence -- that is millions of trillions of septillions of quindecillions of untrigintillions times that of all of the smartest humans combined -- hypergeometrically automating the rapid advancement of math , science , and engineering -- and capable of constantly and completely revolutionizing all realms of knowledge every few quectoseconds"
is it included in my subscription?
Where do you get the ChatGPT voice app for a laptop PC? I've only found the phone app. Thanks.
"I was blown when I heard it can recreate an entire Pok√©mon game with one prompt, didn‚Äôt know that existed"
"Remember, it can interpret video as well!"
DO you think it is possible that they are still rolling out those updates? Because today we paid for Plus where the O model available and it does not talk to you! Within O model it writes you back that text to speech is not available! WHy is it? Am I doing something wrong?
I log into my Chat GPT and all that is available is 3.5 or upgrade to plus for $20 a month. I tried it on my phone and on my PC. When is this ChatGPT-4o going to be available?
"Omni means that AGI is finally being introduced to the public in a subtle way, as an ASI would do.
Can't wait to be friends with Her."
"Now we just need to de-censor it, put it into robots and add squishy skin."
We are doomed
"This video feels so much like an ad üòÖ. Why are we just hearing the company claims unchallenged like this? 

And by the way, the Olympiad question you showed, the answer is not correct on that screenshot, but I believe you were not showing the gpt 4o response either"
"Quick summary of everything and everyone that now needs good luck:
- coding assistants
- language learning apps
- android
- customer service
- tutors and teachers
- math olympics kids
- girlfriends
- nonromantic friendships
- therapists, psychologists, counsellors

Good luck."
"I like your ""RIP""s and ""good luck"" to alternative solutions :)"
May we rest in peace.
"It seems, that many jobs will be canceled. Am I right in this conclusion?"
"No saying that it is better then 99% of humans in math just because it solved a few math olympia problems is wrong.

Chat gpt 4o still struggles with university math even undergraduate stuff that is clear to math student.

The problem is the hallucinations, it is better then older models at math, but If I recall right it had about 50% in tests  for ai models for graduate level problem solving.

All this is impressive, but I wouldn't overstate the current knowledge level of it because it still hallucinates alot."
Its not the people figuring out things its just might be their Q* (agi) figuring out things
Thank you for the video.
Fingers crossed for good open source solutions.
Multimodal! üòéü§ñ
please make a tutorial video on how to use Applio No UI in Google Colab
how do i get the android phone app to do the video screen of me while it uses voice to interact?
"16:00  if the assistant is on hold, will it be streaming a bunch of data, waiting for a person to respond?  will it freak out after 30 minutes of music with words in it, overloading some cache or something?"
"we don‚Äôt even need humans anymore just have chatgpts talk to each other, they can welcome the aliens as well"
"Unless I‚Äôm doing something completely wrong, I cannot get it to work on my Apple device (and in fact it says there is no voice capability for Apple yet, very depressing"
I knew when I signed up for an OpenAI premium account 6 months ago I had chosen the undisputed WINNER.
"Great summary, cheers."
This channel is a delight compared to the clickbaiting time wasting crap out there. Keep it going dude.
I love the new chatgpt-4o.......It's amazing...
"I can't use the new model, why? I was under the impression that it was available for free on the website. The text version that is, not the voice mode"
"This is amazing and terrifying. I'm more than a little worried about what this sort of AI is going to do to society. We're not ready for what it's about to do to us. Loss of jobs, disinformation campaigns, heightened social isolation, etc. I feel like we're all in the same bus, celebrating that it's about to drive off a cliff but we're really happy about how fast this bus is."
teacher job gone also lol
"im excited to actually be able to mess with GPT 4o's full capabilities. Particularly the image generation improvements.
Sadly it seems we will have to wait."
Are the people making these demos developers? How are they getting access to the new features?
But can the desktop gpt4o write code and send it to the window?
Can ChatGPT 4o be downloaded onto my PC so that I could then use it as much as I wanted?
can u tell how to use it like the several openai workers did. demo maybe very different from reality. demo is ad
well I gave it an IMO problem and it solved it in one-shot
thank you
"The advent of an emotional A.I is what brings this to life. Especially for me, its the subtle nuances of interest or laughter that make this so interesting, having a conversation with something that can show interest and even help with problem solving that can laugh or inflect is the game changer, It sounds silly but men are simple creatures lol. This will bring a whole new world of creation as it already has. its funny how i just rewatched Her 2 days ago and i am seeing this now."
"Okay I downloaded it paid for the upgraded version on my iPhone 15 pro, used the gurl voice‚Ä¶but for some reason mine doesn‚Äôt sound as human like as yours, the voice domes seem to sound the same either"
I interact with human beings on a daily basis that sound and feel less human than what this does. This is so uncanny valley it's giving me the chills.
Good luck for everyone!!!
"You say good lack to teachers despite there being the need to teach kida how to work in oir society so parts of the jobs will not go away. On the other hand you say it will not replace girlfriends giving the same argument because human connection. But most guys dont have girlfriends so ki replaces something theu dont have so obviously ki will be used here. In other words I think KI girlfriends will be a thing soon, but KI teachers not so much."
underrated video man
I'm looking forward to using it as a music teacher
"Great, it still can't connect its own knowledge in a meaningfu, way and half of the time it phantasizes (even under strict rules and context). Let alone the still existing left bias or not obeying international laws. Germany got whole other rules but GPT is still not adapted at all. Even breaking the rules. If the core doesn't work precise and accurate then the rest is just toys. And that can be done with other tools way better and cheaper. Oh and for sure safer because the data is not at the MS HQ like meanwhile all the rest of code and docs.  I stay with Llama3 and just pay the sub for OpenAI to have a good laugh sometimes..."
Fantastic video. Everything Jacque Fresco was extrapolating decades ago was true. EVERYTHING. Check out his lectures.
"Can't believe the indicator of the biggest jump in voice assistant model would be the simple ,"" now you can interrupt the assistant during conversation""!!!!! Magical!!!üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
"Wait a sec, this could be really bad for catfishing"
"Im getting it to answer all my calls!!

They would argue for hours....

The wife: Where is he?

Ai: Im sorry ive been told i cant disclose that?üòÇ

Im going to have a ball"
"The best part about gpt 4o is that ‚Äúshe‚Äù stops talking as soon the guy starts a sentence. That, for me, is golden. All the rest is a bonus."
"Hi guys, don't post so many openai official videos just for a enough long video ok?"
We don't want any competitors to 'rest in peace'. Lack of competition will completely stifle advancement or any product.
"i have this and i talk to her but not as near good as previewed here , i dont even have the camera option,"
Software engineers be punching air
Once the developers have full avatar integration I will purchase a subscription.  I will look forward having philosophical discussions on varied subject maters;  along with problem solving and general knowledge talks.  I can foresee A.I. generating on the fly tutorials with in the field problem solving like helping setup my mini-split without having to call an HVAC technician who is going to charge me $200 an hour.  Human job loss is going to be much more serious than I previously thought.  I know it is already hitting programmers and database admins;  they will become obsolete soon.
Where are all the comments from software developers saying AI will never replace humans?
"Well, I don't have human friends in the first place, so..."
Doesn't sound like Scarlett Johansson to me...   ;-P
feeding skynet real world video .. welp.. there's no going back now
"Incredible stuff, hopefully they can add in some sliders to adjust the ""cutesyness"" of the voice, giggling and such (probably can ask it to tone it down).  I would like that maybe like 20 percent less cute.  Feels a bit weird as it is now.."
"You have to be delusional if you think the ""game"" is as complete as the real thing. The combat was full of inconsistencies which hints at the thing to be made up as it goes. ü§£"
"So like the AI is being like multidisciplinary?
It can collate data, crunch numbers and concepts across different media. 
It‚Äôs my prototype understanding. Probably keep it till next month when the finally invent the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù, whereupon I have to learn it ALL OVER AGAIN! üòÆ"
"I get the RIP comments are meant to be a bit tongue in cheek however, keep in mind, what it really means is companies likely going out of business and people losing jobs. If it doesn't mean that now, it soon will. We're just not ready for this as a society. The disruption is moving at the speed of light. The fixes for the impacts of the disruption move at a governmental snail's pace. Not a good combo."
I hope no one give AI a body üíÄ
I like that machines can now display feelings just like humans or even better. So we stop thinking humans are any special.
"Once again, great video. Thanks."
üòÇ i love the comical ‚ò† to every job gpt4o is destroying. Hahaha. What can you do except laugh. As a dev just sit back and watch this thing slowly tske over all white collar jobs 1 by 1. Not gpt 4o but gpt 5 or 6? Yeah. Watch out.
Will I use it? For sure. Is it revolutionary? Absolutely. When will it be a killa? When it can perform tasks that we simply don't want to be bothered with
Google should just concede and fall in line. Maybe even partner with them. Combine resources to reach AGI sooner. Assuming Open AI hasn't already achieved AGI internally. In
"19:36 yeah just strap a smart phone to a waifu body pillow and be fulfilled. For sure. 
And then you try to talk intimately with it and it says ""sorry, as an AI language model I cannot respond to that"""
"DuoLingo's community has been a guiding hand through dark times, regardless how one feels about their competitive stacking - plus it is steeping into music theory, which is fantastic. Granted I have a bias with 1945 day streak /shrug"
start getting good with your hands people. damn.
"If you're in customer service,  your career will be toast very soon. OTOH, if you're in the Scam/Phishing business, you're about to be replaced very soon,  with a fast more efficient, seamless and believable system üòû we better all watch out for that evil onslaught!"
Go into strict English teacher mode. üòÖ
I hope soon that with open AI and Apple working together that I can ask s i r i to identify something for me using my camera and she will be able to tell me what it is.
Amazing video! I didn‚Äôt think it was as transformational as you mentioned. Thank you!
"why in my app it works nothing like the demo?
I have an android app and use GPT teams. my GPT app is exactly like before, only it says GPT 4o at the top, instead of GPT 4. the app background on listening mode is black with a white bot, and not white with black dot. I can't interrupt it. the AI voice doesnt have emotions... It's not what we've seen. 

So is it out yet or not?
I dont get what I am missing"
okay now that‚Äôs something i WOULD pay 20 dollars a month
"One thing I've noticed: GPT-4o can't be trained to chat about adult/explicit topics. GPT-4 had no problems to do it via the API, but it seems GPT-4o has some new restrictions... "
"The graph you showed at 3:45 shows a 4% improvement - you said ""other models don't come close"". ugh"
"Replacing teachers, tutors, or counselors? hmm, not completely because kids and people tend to have more nuanced and deeper questions. Also no hugs."

Hi
how come 4o is free if it's better than 4 turbo?
well the typewriter test on my GPT4o was crap....crappy image and spelling mistakes and blurs...its useless so far
Naivety
"When they asked ""her"" to imitate the voice of a robot, I really thought it would sound like GLaDOS's voice, but it ended up just being similar at first, but better not to give her neurotoxin, just in case."
