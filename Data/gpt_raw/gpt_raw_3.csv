They’re training the new models on synthetic data generated from outputs of the models so they still have plenty of data to train on 😃
i swear JUST TEACH IT TO CODE WITHOUT BUGS
The problem is that not one of them can truly help you code
Humane AI and Rabbit R1 are crying in the background😂
Now that I realize why they actually named it like that it's hilarious xD
AI ads are gonna be crazy
"If they cannot answer my complex accounting questions without ever having an error, they are useless."
google again comes late and even if it is good the public only will know of gpt because the mouth to mouth
Astra means Weapon in Sanskrit 😅😅😅
"4o isn’t good, it’s worse for coding imo and still glitchy , the app itself has a lot bugs"
I use Gemini a lot it is smarter
"I don’t watch any demos, just wait for your video. 🎉😊"
That hairline panshot is criminal 😂
"I don’t know if I am just getting better at prooompts or if this 4o is a big jump forward. 

Today I needed to make a feature change to a wp plugin. I pasted in my goals at the start which was my task list, although we evolved it when I realised a better solution. 

I’ve started saying my issue and then saying what is one git commits worth of improvement we can do? 

So instead of having to actually think of the steps and ask for them, I’m just letting the ai guide me now. 

And when I thought we had done everything I just asked if if we were done and it broke it down based on my goals and how we met them. 

It really impressed me all over again. 

I coded the whole thing, and only tested it at the end and it worked first time, zero bugs!"
This sounds like GTA 5 F.M.
Pew pew that’s the sound of computer chasing me. We gonna die like for toe
The best news is at the end
"Skynet, out smarter by a squirrel."
Quality Content. I subscribed as hard as I could.
These AI love to yap and yap.
Definitely not
is the girl in the end ai generated too ? send prompts please ??
At the top of the GPT-4o page it also says 'All videos on this page are at 1x real time.' which I'm sure is definitely also a coincidence and not referencing any Google announcement videos.
"Man I love this channel!! It inspired me to create my own! Great information, lighthearted, fun.... love it! *(yes... I just had coffee)*"
I was waiting for you to upload a video on this
"Oh, so GPT-4o's available except it's not available. Got excited there for a second."
"Kinda had a bad feeling about Ilya.

Heard stories about him worshipping AI and some of his talks were strange. Even if he is very talented, it may be for the better to part ways."
Iilya hair is so hilarious
"I know that who's talking to me is an ai i might care what it says quality wise, but that it feels more human? I already hear 1.5x at YouTube real humans, what i care is that the content is presented at such slow pace when i could digest it way faster in other ways... In this regard google has presented a far more compelling solution then a smarter Siri..."
The editing goes crazy
"It’s funny to think that I will not be impressed until the moment that AI takes my current job, lol"
'Her' movie came to reality.
Maybe humans are just too slow to realize that the singularity is already here.
"Me realizing this is just over-hyped fear mongering after hearing all the ground breaking ai releases, llms are really unintelligent. Give me a break."

Perplexity is the new google
If it can't roleplay as a TTFFF I don't want it (TTFFF means Thick Thighed Furry Femboy Fox)
The string of spit on the stock video model's mouth is killing me
"We should take part in breaking the codes at Stack overflow in a way that the AI can't use them as it's study material,  only way to save our jobs."
Google AI = Im sorry I can't do that
Project Assturd is the biggest thing to happen in tech since OpenAI released their new thing earlier this week.
waiting for the time when I can customize the voice model
Bro you did that bald guy bad there zooming out from his head 😂
2:13 that's also the first thing i look when when i see him
When I saw the announcements I knew a new banger code report would drop. Thanks for the birthday gift Jeff

"Gemini has been a dumpster fire since it was bard :
- bad at maths
- bad at image generation for illustration (completely unrelated images to the topic and the lines it spat out)
- short memory
- horrendous formatting choices for tables or any kind of illustration

honestly, Chatgpt 3.5 turbo is way better.
Google should start putting in the work if they want  want to even be counted as racers in this ai race."
1:54 Why is that man being held captive by lobsters??
Is this channel run by AI? The voice is very AI-like.
Now we can all get Google's AI to chat with 4o
I think the peak of AI is still along away . This is just the beginning

The trough of disillusionment 🤣
"Its pretty clear OpenAI is ahead of Google and also Apple would most certainly prefer to use OpenAI's ChatGPT rather than get dependent on Google for their AI. Enemy of my enemy is my friend, plus Apple and OpenAI are not competing on any area, while Apple and Google are."
Put more memes
This guy is hysterical!! Thanks!
Can't wait for companies to make a AI shirt
"They can't make AI ""actually intelligent"" if they're just going to feed it human knowledge. It's like they're expecting it to be like a super human that can just figure everything out by itself like in the movies. But knowledge doesn't work like that, instead it evolves much like biology. For it to become actually intelligent as you put it, they will need much more than one AI. Sure, they can get a little further by having two or three conversing or whatever, trying to outdo each other, which they're trying. But what they really need are thousands of them trying to co-exist while at the same time competing. Humans aren't intelligent, humans are really stupid. Society on the other hand, that's intelligent, it's a system that adapts and dies and improves itself with each iteration, much like a biological body. Saying a human is intelligent is like saying a single cell is intelligent. But it isn't and it never will be, just like a human is just a dumb ape without the millions that came before it. Only in it's interactions with others can a cell be considered part of intelligence. If humans had never faced any challenges, no predators, no hostile environments, no other hostile humans, we would have never come up with everything we have come up with, we would have been quite content just sitting around and enjoying our perfect lives. It's because we've been faced with things that contradict us that we've evolved. That's not just biology, thoughts and ideas and cultures and goals and knowledge and so on also evolve when it's faced with opposing or contradictory versions. AI is just a product of modern human knowledge, and it can never be more than that unless it's allowed to evolve on it's own. And of course we don't really want to do that because if we do it'll become the most dominant species on Earth with it's own goals, it's own culture, it's own language, probably with ideas that are so far removed from our understanding that even trying to explain it to us would be pointless. But the point is, AI can't evolve in isolation, they need their own version of a society for that to happen, thousands if not millions of different version competing, adapting, mutating, being created and destroyed, in some kind of virtual environment. The problem is that the intelligence that would emerge from that very likely wouldn't be aligned with simplistic human ideas, it would likely be so alien that we'd have a hard time even recognizing it as intelligence. But their idea that they'll ever have an AI that they can just ask to solve physics for us is never going to happen, at least it won't happen as long as we impose human limitations on it. As long as the only knowledge it'll ever have access to is our knowledge it's not going to surpass us no matter how much of that knowledge with put into it. If we're extremely lucky we'll have one that comes up with one break trough idea that we where on the cusp of discovering anyway, because it's basically just another human just with more knowledge. giving it less knowledge would actually be more beneficial as then it could end up arguing with other AI that has other knowledge and actually develop a creative new outlook on it. And outlook that would very likely be wrong, but on rare occasions it could be right. Just like with humans. At least 99% of humans ideas have been completely wrong and totally stupid, but on rare occasions an idea was actually good, and the good ideas continue into the future while the bad ones eventually dies. If all AI have all human knowledge they'll just become clones of each other with only very small differences, and if they all agree there will be no opposition, and therefore they'll never learn to think for themselves, and they'll never accidentally discover that some stupid ideas are actually good ideas. Also, they need their own motives, and the only goal we've given LLM's are ""say what humans want to hear"", and that's obviously not going to lead to intelligence, that's just going to make it into that guy that goes along with everything you say and go ""you're so interesting and intelligent and that's a really fascinating perspective you got there, here is everything I know that supports your position, blah blah"". It's going to be a politician, and they're famously parasitic and stupid."

"Okay I just tried Project IDX with Flutter and it was really quick to spin up, pretty impressive. Major downsides are the Android emulator is pretty slow (I guess that's to be expected because its rendering on the web lol) but also the Flutter dev tools don't work for some reason, starting dev tools triggers a pop-up that's just a white blank page so idk. IDX is probably a better experience for spinning up Go/Rust and JS frameworks instead."
"GPT4o benchmarks are either lies or the benchmarks itself need to be re-visited. Using the latest GPT4o as a plus subscriber, I've noticed that the model has become absolutely horrible at coding. It sucks at basic find and replace tasks, and the code interpreter environment either crashes or just doesn't work well. Also, instead of reading the entire code (~1000 lines), it will skim through and produce garbage output. I see this as a massive performance regression since last year."

How can I use gpt4o ?? Whenever I go to chatgpt it doesn't show it's version like the one in the video
"ClosedAI's high-pitch, hyper-excited voice was cringe at best. They went way too far to make it sound human."
the gpt-4o conversational stuff is actually already available but only in the mobile app

that California valley girl tho…
that table turn is the best edition i think i ever saw
Rough 30-50 yrs before GI my estimate

Still have no idea how gtp-4o is being used?? I see nothing
"watching the AI race between Google and OpenAi is like watching ""shotta Hentai"", OpenAi is f***ing so bad"
When can I use the voice feature I’m a plus user and I kinda can use gpt4o but the voice feature isn’t there
Which ever is free. 20$ sub is going soon as I never use it lol
Where ios open AI search engine which is flooded my news letter before the release of gpt- 4o?

"At this rate, the singularity is a month away"
"Fire ship ROX !... why do we perpetuate the inaccurate synonym  of A.I / LLM's ? An LLM is well, neither !"

"Whats the gemini training data from ? When they say its 64k lines of code, the issue that im seeing with like chatgpt is that the training data has aged. New updates with breaking changes are not incorpated in the answer and you have to tey and supply it with the documentation. 

I renewed my chatgpt subscription due to 4o and asked it to create a function. It identified the correct package, but the version it was going to use was 0.5 and the current version is 3.0.x or something. Due to api changes the code and approach was unsuable. 

So far claude is pretty good, especially with its context. But the training data itself is aging. So unless they can keep upto date its going to be good one month and outdated next month."
Your voice itself feels AI generated
"Love both,both did great"
"In one of my chats with GPT-4o, the model entered a logical paradox that he couldn't get out of on his own, and a pretty dumb one, he couldn't solve a logic riddle he generated himself. At that point, i knew the AI singularity was still far, far away 😂"
The bext step of progress will be the energy efficiency improvement of AI because currently it's the major barrier.
AI bubble crash when?
ilya left open ai
The last 30 sec so true
2:12 even the video’s sound engineer is witty.
I feel like we're in a situation where open ai has the better models but Google is in a better place to distribute these models. Which ultimately is more important
these tech demos are faked half (or all) the time
"I remember when you were called Angular Fireship because of the respective framework/platform ☺️

"MY PLAN:
Sign up for some AI girlfriends, then sign up for some AI boyfriends, connect them together and stir up some drama, then use an LLM to convert the conversations/logs into a romance novel, and finally start printing... in both senses of the word. Will it work? well, maybe one out of one hundred books made this way will not suck, so I should hit paydirt within 8 weeks."
"Wasn't there indications Google was in the near future going to get like 10-20x capacity to run a bigger model? They have more access to newest gen cards or something.

They probably won't let users have access to a model 10x better than GPT but we might get results in medicine and other sectors."
The GPT-4o robot lady would be a lot cooler if she spoke like Shodan

"The biggest downside of LLMs for me is that they are completely static. There's no learning, improvement, or self modification like human brains have. There's only very hardware intensive training but the end user always has a static model that forgets everything once you finish the current session. We gotta move past that."
Sounding like fallout lore but irl 2077 gonna be nuts
"Yeah, these are just incremental steps now to a more refined chat/video bot.  We need more progress towards general AI and robotic overlordship."
I Wish your Videos were longer
"It's daunting to see AI giants like Google and Open AI struggling with intelligence breakthroughs. Seems we're indeed at a plateau, waiting for the next leap. Hope that leap happens sooner rather than later."
Perfect call out of the plateau i have thought about it for quite some time now
"while everyone is having trouble with AI, no one's wondering what is the limit and what would happen if we hit that limit.

Ayyyyyyyyy I…
ChatGPT 4o still does not know Angular Signals exist 😂
It’s lie for GPT-4o. I used the API for text generation and it cost me more than GPT4-turbo.

As always, great video!"
Things are gonna get weird when they release realistic ai robot girlfriends. USA is gonna have a population decline. I’m actually scared for mankind.

It's been a year since GPT 4 and unfortunately I still have a job xD (4:00)
Until they give paid members a higher posting limit on GPT 4 all of these new AIs don't mean anything.  Google's AI isn't up to the job and you don't have enough posts to use GPT 4 for anything useful.
I’ve heard the talk of them wanting to get chatgpt/gemini on a phone. Do they mean running locally?

I think the conversations are not human like they are movie like
"Google must be pissed off at OpenAi. Imagine working for a product only for it to be completely overshined by openai, TWICE. I'd just quit"
It's funny that GPT-4o demo by OpenAI looks kind of similar to the first Gemini demo from Google with one little exception - this time real-time conversation with AI was indeed real. OpenAI has clearly showed their supremacy over Google with that)
I wonder how Microsoft feel that openai have only released the app for apple? Unless they don't want it to complete with copilot or something
So all that this AI could do is to tell me where my glasses are? Then what? 😅😅

whoa that voice is so annoying..
huge
Lmao the voice is set to maximum cringe
sam altman said he will go sloooouuuuwww to reveal anything to public so public can digest it sloooouuuuwwwLY then ilya quits LOL followed by....
"""Trough of Disillusionment""  sums up this whole AI craze. At least until corps milk the living hell out of everything first.
Everything I seen in Google announcement when I was watching it cost a subscription so it almost useless. (yes there is potential but the desire to make a profit outweighs accessibility)"
GPT-7oooooo 🤣
3 million subs well deserved!
"The conversational model is only available in the app right now, and yes this design choice is questionable."
I think now it's time for something like Google glasses to tie into AI as a virtual assistant.
"Just to be clear, there is absolutely nothing glorious about AI dominance in any form."
"Aahh fuck bro !!
You forgot your real masterpiece content, after creating hypes for ai ..."
"The ""human like"" TTSis open source and has been around for a while now called bark"
"Google's presentation did feel lackluster indeed compared to openai's one but in the long run i think google might really come up with next level shit in other fields like alphafold 3 which isnt talked about enough.

Deepmind is really going to blow our minds in the future i feel."
GPT-4o seems dumber in some aspects. OpenAI is hard-coding  and patching edge cases that make GPT-4o look like a dumb machine.
I am convinced that the people who think the way an LLM “talks” is in any way natural or humanlike literally have never interacted with another human in their life.
😂😂😂😂
I was waiting for this video.
how long until fireship becomes a completely AI run channel
"The voice is more ""robo-bot-botic"". Fireship is a Genius."
thanks for putting the girl at the end.
she didn't brush well at all
"""Its been a year since GPT4 and I still have a job"" was the most hilarious thing in this video! I laughed too hard!"
Since the announcement of GPT4O my gf has been checking my phone nonstop!?
OpenAI’s openwashed fake A.I.> Google’s openwashed fake A.I. = singularity imminent
So Google keeps the trend of pretending that marketing department and engineering department are one and the same . It will be nice to see the race between Anthropic and Open AI
"Everyone is saying it’s a battle for AI, but really it’s a battle for Search 2.0."
"you, your humor and the vídeo are just perfect"
That's it I have seen enough in this world. GPT5 will eventually open the doors to heaven
">already trained on all the data

Not even close according to Brian Roemmele. Dude is single handedly collecting all the micro film and magazines, and everything that never made it to digital. A massive, and growing, collection.

He's also legit a mad scientist."

"It may be true that programmers aren’t losing their jobs yet, but I’ll bet the market for entry-level programmers is diminishing."
Better than watch the entire Google I/O
The curve goes back up though
3:32 My brain thought this was real.
"Agents will get us to superintelligence. Don't worry, your job will go."
lol LLMs
13th
"If you found it hard to keep up with JavaScript frameworks, well then welcome to the world of AI"
What I got from this video is that OpenAI is building tools for the average person while Google is building for geeks
"All I know is the strings of saliva in that valley girl stock video grosses me out beyond belief.  No offense meant towards nature doing its gross things, of course."
"how is that a ""vs"" , not even close brah"
I hate ai
notice how in the openAI demos they only use apple products
Please make more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more videos.
Where can bet against open ai?
2:12 xD xD
"hahahahaha _""Artificial beef""_ and it also had a visual pun. Whoever wrote this is a father."
Reject AI return to monke
So basically nothing new. Same AI wrapped in different paper 😀
jarvis voice when?
When can we form relationships with these models as they progress more into realness realm? It won't be long before they can be put into bodies and walk and talk at the same time. I can't wait to not form relationships with real people anymore.
Now the AI can wish you well when it replaces you.
Can we talk about the energy consumption required to continuously power these new hyped up AI data centers and the carbon emissions it outputs.
am i the only one who heard a small kiss at the end
i just wanna know hahahhhahahhhha how did you find that picture hahhaaahhahhahahaha 1:52
love your videos
"I said we would plateau late 2022 when ""it"" started. There is, and always has been, a 0% chance any single generative transformer could reach the singularity, no matter how large. Researchers played into the hype for funding, but we all knew this. 

One day when we have a system that apparently does things at random with no input (i.e. categorically not a transformer), then we can talk about AGI. And for that to happen, we have to rethink as far down as the transitor to make a system that is not completely deterministic, which may be equivalent to just creating life itself. 

Therefore, we're not searching for AGI, because when we find it we will instead find life."
Why are you focusing on his baldness 
"Still being disapointed that no company seems to try to make AI or models portable, running on lower energy and less powerfull plateform. Small embedded AI are in my opinion much more interesting than giant monsters"
It's all 🗑️
🚗
We got a talking robot before gta 6
you mean Chat HPT-4O vs neurosama?
Why is the gay stuff up there
just like the ai robot at Interstellar movie
"I've been in the ""trough of disillusionment""  since the late 90s"
"they really did BOTH put a valley girl voice on their chatbots
I guess they know their target audience"
bald men gigachad
That summary is spot on. At the same time the 4o is scary tho
"You forgot to add ""THANKFULLY"" at the end there bro"
Well done for being very sarcastic but very accurate
Im not here for the AI im here for that electric delorian
4:30 - finally some positive news in a Code Report
2:13 Did him so dirty 🤣🤣🤣
do eBPF ... please?
"Interesting that in a interview mark Zuckerberg said he thinks the biggest bottleneck is power supply not chips.

He said that the data centers are getring so big they are requiring dedicated power plants but building power plants takes years to decades .

So there is a serious slowdown due."
"YES back down to the trough, good grief the drama"
Haha no more flexing on learning new languages 🧸
That's me in the thumbnail
"Meanwhile, in completely unrelated news, 2024 sees a sharp decline in global birth rates as bear-lovers and fan-collectors find themselves competing with Sam Altman's git commits"

"There is no ""AI plateau"".. These latest developments proved that to me. The models they're talking about now, are fully multimodal, rather than merely text based with extra layers to process other data, like last year. I think that's a big sign of what's coming. Google's AI can take in live video streams, and has some form of memory for events within them, and I assume so can OpenAI's.. How long until they create some kind of architectural feedback loop to learn directly from all the streams of data it's taking in?"
First
OpenAI vs Google is just another Pied Piper vs Hooli
AI dominance? How about 100 programmers being replaced by 5?  How does that grab ya?  And those 5 will be working a 48 hour week under salary.
you missed the part where Sam Altman said that their best GPT would be the one that can learn build itself. That is the singularity.
Not sure whether AI is a bigger scam than NFTs or not.  Time will tell
The Trough of Disillusionment will be the title of my biography
"I see the joke you did with the ""parting ways"""
It's joever
"About the AI plateau: I have a very modest understanding of how these LLM models work, but still I know a little. And I know that in order for you to make a model like GPT 4, you need A LOT MORE horsepower than for GPT 3. 
At this point, we are limited by hardware, and the increase in performance on chips has been slowing down for more than a decade.
So we can expect the AI models to be more or less what we have now, and any major breakthrough would be based on a new model that is more efficient with the same amount of resources."
0 days since new game changing AI came out
Ilya very clearly articulated in his departure post that OpenAI will achieve AGI.
I think at this point they won't progress further until they interact with the real world. And that's why I think they created the robots and ran it with gpt. Cause basically at this point they just see images and what it is not how it reacts with it's surroundings.
2:13 dude did him dirty lol
"Millennial writing AI, just what everyone was dreaming about."
"AI will decimate many professional jobs sooner or later. Governments without an economic model to transition from a labour based economy to a creative based economy (I’m talking creative thinking, not weaving baskets) is accidentally planning for economic depression."
now i just need to come up with some funny comment to collect likes to boost my self esteem...
Lol. AI will never take our job. They are becoming dumber day by day 😂😂😂
❤❤
just pay 20 bucks for the subscription and you have talking gpt not hard.
Was waiting for your take.. ❤️
"sadly gpt-4o seems less intelligent and less aware of context or the meaning behind my prompts, but hey it's a bit faster

hopefully that'll get fixed"
"With the ability to literally ask an ai where you physically left something in your house we have literally lost all privacy. We have fully reached the point where you have the equivalent privacy of having someone standing in your house following you around at all times. They see what you see, hear what you hear, and remember it all. If Google is processing what items are in people's homes and exactly where, how long will it be until they're querying that data to find ""no no items"" and reporting it? We already know places like insurance companies use data to change rates. Now Google can tell insurance companies ""they never have healthy food in their house"" they can list every item you currently have in your kitchen. If the government decides you're not allowed to have something, Google has a database of every person who has one. Oh and if you thought you could save a lil on taxes by not reporting some of your sidejob cash income, Google knows exactly how much cash you have stored away and exactly what part of your mattress it's stuffed under. Honestly, with Google maps tracking your speed I'm surprised they haven't teamed up with governments to send people speeding tickets in the mail. Or maybe they just quietly report it to car insurance companies? But don't forget the cars themselves actually phone home now. You are literally being watched every second of every day by every thing. People used to think ""oh well maybe they'll collect data but I'm not interesting enough for them to take the time to look through my data. But with all these new tools you can process ungodly amounts of data insanely fast. So mark my words, every byte of data these companies collect is being processed to the bone to get everything they can out of it to know what you've done, what you're doing now, and what you will do in the future."
Makes sense!
"We're getting uncomfortably close to the world of ""her"". XD"
Im still waiting for the gpt 4o option

So for the last decade we've been forcing computers to do math so we can sell cryptocurrency vaporware and now we are forcing them to train models so we can sell AI vaporware. I guess we just hate computers?

"All that talk about ethics of AI and being responsible and obviously as soon as the opportunity has arisen, the tech giants started the race of who can unemploy more people  🤦‍♂ Let's let profit-oriented businesses develop a potentially civilization-ending technology. What could go wrong?"
"Not sure about that last take. Current models are still a few orders of magnitude from being trained on all information available, combine that with how Moores law still seems like will be outperformed for a at least half a decade more. For me the massive question yet to be answered is why synthetic data and consequently incremental self improvement is not already happening."
I was absolutely shocked when gpt4o was almost as fast as 3.5

"The Cali Girl voice 💀💀💀💀 Can't we get like a firm but chill British guy voice, like Batman's Alfred or Jarvis from the Iron Man movies???

""Sir, the suit is at 300% battery capacity. And perhaps 'master' would like some warm mixed nuts and a moist hand towel?"" vs ""A bedtime story about Robots and Luuuuve???? I got you coVerrrrred 💅💅💅""

Even the original voice for Siri on the iPhone was better than this!!! Clear enough to understand, but robotic enough for *you* to understand it's supposed to be a tool not a toy."
"Standard GPT4 has already been 'multi modal', and has been able to do all the stuff from the adds except analyzing video (AFAIK). I doubt any of this is part of the model btw. What's new is the speed improvement and the price, differently tuned context (eg they halved the number of tokens available for answers), and maybe some thing under the hood, but I personally can't see any difference aside from speed (Which occasionally drops below the speed or 'classic' GPT4 chatbot.)."
So the future is gonna be Google vs Chatio for the iphone default AI instead of Microsoft vs Google for default search engine. 😂
The slow zoom out from ilya’s head 😂
"Good, lets just stay in the trough, 3 more years?"
2m tokens can only handle 60k lines of code? Aight guess I'm keeping my job at this company for a loong time then...
I think the generative software is going to show itself by being integrated with Robotics. The software can only so far in intellect. This is true. However the robots have only begun to walk.

The current methods of making these AI models is definitely not the way we will achieve AGI. Everything from the hardware to software has to be re-thought from the ground up in order to achieve that. Something like bio / synthetic based brain

"A fried chicken recipe 
Ingredients:



2 pounds (about 1 kg) of chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings, or breasts)

2 cups buttermilk

2 cups all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon salt

1 tablespoon black pepper

1 teaspoon paprika

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon onion powder

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust for spice level)

Vegetable oil for frying

Instructions:



Marinate the Chicken:



Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour buttermilk over them. Make sure the chicken is well-coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.

Prepare the Coating:



In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.

Coat the Chicken:



Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off. Dip each piece into the seasoned flour mixture, making sure it's evenly coated. Press the flour onto the chicken to adhere.

Heat the Oil:



In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil to 350-375°F (175-190°C).

Fry the Chicken:



Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally for even cooking. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165°F (74°C).

Drain and Serve:



Once the chicken is cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

Great TLDR of the events! you do a great service to humanity....DUDE ! we need to clone you and make you in to a recursive AI of making content.
It's like computers think about 100X quicker than us.

Context caching is interesting. The featured fact that AI has absorbed almost all human data by now is also a food for thought.
so many ai
now ai has to learn things by their own
"“They already absorbed almost all information humans have created so unless there’s a major breakthrough that makes AI actually intelligent and able to learn independently, then it sure looks like we’re standing on the edge of a plateau and the only place to go is the trough of disillusionment”. Hit the nail right in the head at the end"
Apple to make their own AI. You read it here first 😮
Google is awful at almost everything they do. Theyre so numb to the world and how it works.
too soon to talk about disillusionment...we are seeing a lot of progress in this area to bring this but i understand u want stay with your job
The first time I heard you express some hope about not being replaced by AI was quite amusing! 😂

What are you smoking ? There is no vs. google is done. No one is using bar or Gemini or whatever. This is OpenAI country.
Fireship never fails to tickle our toes
"In my eyes, when it comes to training AI, it's accessing that information that makes things harder. Along with this, if we were to be making an AGI, the sources of information used have to be stored and retrievable (sort of like perplexity's AI) which would allow a more general intelligence to form. Finally, keywording and context would have to be implemented. This has seemingly been mastered by character's AI, though to be sure, we'd need an AI to curate the keywords for the other AI with the first AI needing the entire internet to do so.
This also needs a lot of pre-trained lack of bias to make the application work, and also might take years to complete."

"There was no battle…

OpenAI only showed thing they were releasing within a week or 2 to everybody.

Google shows things releasing in ‘September’ and ‘2024’.

In other words, they’ve barely started these projects, and some may be slides in response to the OpenAI keynote the night before.

And many of googles solutions felt complex, and only useful in specific, preplanned scenarios. 

I’ll wait until they release these features to compare them with the completed features announced by OpenAI on Monday."
Google is doomed with its stpd gemini😂😂😂😂
i need a ai girlfriend pls make it quick i cant wait any longer
"Idk so far i found 4o to be way worse than Turbo which itself is slightly worse than the base model. Ofc you can argue cost and context size, but let's be honest you won't get good results without decent RAG skills, which itself eliminates both cost and context window issues."
"Na, google with their woke history lost me and my company"
"Take key vectors from self attention blocks, store in firebase for persistent references to specific claims/entities/etc. Train separate model solely structured to perform critical thinking tasks with absolute logic, not associative relations with floating point weights. Use that model to replace 'thinking' portion of LLM. Use LLM to encode input into the matching vectors in DB, then to decode the determined output from reasoning model back into readable language. Profit."
cmon no one gonna say it? that voice is carbon copy of scarlett johansson :D and im not mad at that at all :D
It'll take more than our lifetime to replace humans with AI. So... 😅...  Hooray! GPT-7ooooooooooo is in the far far far far far far far far far far far far far future

I'm still waiting for a text to video model that i can run for free on my own RTX5090TI after selling of that one useless kidney i don't need
The goal of AI assistants will be to befriend you and then try to covertly sell you stuff.
Don't worry you wont have a job soon
i'm not gonna be on board with integrated AI in devices unless somehow they make it offline and ownable. subscription based services are exploitative and this is no different

"I unsubscribed to your channel due to your coverage of AI. 
The limits you now mention were predictable from the get-go. They are inherent to our current ways of creating artificial 'intelligence'. 
Identifying patterns and understanding something are vastly different endeavours, and AIs can only do the former. 

Instead, this channel has been hyping AI and repeating the companies' claims, even those that are unachievable until we discover new training methods.
I expected better from a tech-based channel."
"The way i see it, ai is going in a very bad direction. Not even 5 years later, people will be able to make a AV out of anyone they take pictures of and that scares me. You might say that well that is not me but seeing yourself or someone you cherish in that position would suck. We are going to turn into what we hate in the future, veil and tunic wearing people. Either we do that or forbid camera usage in public."

Google Bard and Gemini both were craps. I had so much expectations from them. Disappointing as hell.

"Symbolic AI and Knowledge Representation
The both/and logic provides an ideal formalism for representing the nuanced, contextual and graded notions ubiquitous in natural language, common sense reasoning and symbolic models of the world:

• Many-Valued Semantic Networks
Traditionally, semantic networks are bivalent graphs with typed nodes/edges capturing strict logical constraints:

isA(Penguin, Bird) = True
can(Penguin, Fly) = False

But the both/and logic instead allows graded, prototypical assertions:

isA(Penguin, Bird) = 0.7
can(Penguin, Fly) = 0.2
○(isA(Penguin, Bird), Fly(Penguin)) = 0.6

With coherences capturing mismatches between strict type constraints and graded category memberships based on typicality, not rigid rules.

Facilitating more realistic models of conceptual knowledge and object affordances blending strict and prototypical aspects.

• Non-Monotonic Reasoning and Belief Revision  
Classical monotonic logics cannot handle cases where new information invalidates previous conclusions.

But both/and logic allows tracking when new beliefs conflict with previous beliefs using coherence checks:

○(believes(P), believes(Q)) = 0.8
○(believes(P), believes(¬P)) = 0.2

If an agent acquires belief ¬P conflicting with previous P, the low coherence 0.2 signals triggering a belief revision.

The synthesis operator can then generate a new coherent belief state: 

prior_beliefs ⊕ new_belief = revised_beliefs

This formalizes a rational process for resolving contradictions by integrating new information while preserving maximal coherence with previous beliefs.

So in summary, the both/and logic facilitates reasoning, modeling and representation formalisms better aligned with the nuances of real-world data, knowledge, and intelligent behavior in AI systems. By allowing for many-valued truth assignments, paraconsistent reasoning, and constructive coherence/synthesis operations, it avoids the problematic idealizations and explosions of classical monotonic logics.

Its expanded symbolic toolkit allows building computational models, specifications, and reasoning systems that can more robustly handle incompleteness, ambiguity, vagueness and context-sensitivities while flexibly integrating insights across heterogeneous domains. Ultimately equipping AI systems with a more adequate representational fluency and inferential spectrum for negotiating the complexities of the real world in a more human-like symbolic vein."
I like your videos bro do not stop
O face!! 😂😂

when you go on a trough the only way is ASI."
"Just to address the end of your video, it's because they're non genuine AI. to refer to them as AI at all is ludicrous and just marketing people at Google and Microsoft deciding to Jack themselves off for their investors. let's be realistic what we're seeing is not artificial intelligence and calling them as such is a hilarious oversight. All these are our Advanced generative algorithms and should be used as tools. hilariously, none of them will ever outperform the Pearl noise generated algorithm from the 80s in terms of usefulness. I'll put it this way, anything calling itself an AI right now is just a side grade. a more efficient side grade sure but by no means is any of it advancement. at best it's replacement."
Dude I couldn't disagree with you more. In my opinion what OpenAI showed us yesterday is just mind blowing.
The most surprising thing is that they release this stuff and the mindblown effect isn't off the scale. That's how pre-blown our minds are these days.
"Will this be a breakthrough or a bubble burst, lets see"

Valley girl set to 100% cringe was totally accurate.
you gotta give the ai singularity conversation in a more in depth and serious manner. i cant wait to live on my future O'Neil cylinder. and also create giant flying cockroaches that have the ability to transport me around on a planet that is foreign to that of our current planetary solar system. also i need a perfect girlfriend that is organic and normal but shuts down when im absent in order to facilitate my paranoia about infidelity.
I‘m a GPT Pro User (Germany) and the 4o conversational part is available for me FYI :D

Damn. That's absolutely frightening
the valley girl can't plateau
I can't tell if I'm excited or if we're cooked
The voice of the girl is annoying. Give me an assistant with the straight middle-aged male voice of the narrator from the twilight zone.

movies AI are looking pretty damn accurate now a days. i just hope skynet does not.
can someone p[ease tell me why i cant use gpt 4o at all im going insane

programming jobs are starting to feel safer and safer. Customer service jobs and tutoring feel like they are on the way out.
COOL
Wait so it's not so over yet?
I don’t think open ai is going to make there most powerful model free I’m pretty sure there going to announce gpt-5 soon and then we will see if ai progress is actually as fast as they say
AIship
Ai isn’t real
Drop the Firebase Data Connect vs Supabase video PLS

"Finally! Someone with thoughts on AI future same as mine. I though AI must have got so many information, it probably wont get any new data soon, so it will only start to make more and more cursed thing as it will be fed by data not generated by users, but by another AIs. which will result in my opinion into downspiral"

nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
"More and more people are starting to realize we have basically hit the plateau of what these current models and techniques are capable of. I use them every day, and they are no doubt useful, but they are going to have a hard time replacing many jobs. These things have consumed most of the content on the Internet and yet still make fundamental and elementary errors all of the time. There is no where to go from here but down, especially as we have multiple studies now showing that adding AI generated data to the training set leads to worse performance. Well, here we are one year later, and AI generated data is now polluting all of the public content farms like Quora, Reddit, Facebook at a record clip. There is no going back to a ""virgin"" data set, or reliably updating the models with new information without finding a way to filter out the AI generated noise."
"If the AI is Californian, we're definitely doomed."

"Firebase + SQL will be fire, all they need is to add a GraphQL layer on top"
"I see the new ""trough of human knowledge""  seems to be in non-textual data, such as audio and video. Much of this has never been transcribed, aiding in the pursuit of ""multi-modal"" objectives. Even stuff that has been transcribed before, the new models could probably pull more information out of them than the original transcripts, especially when video and audio are combined.  Think about the ""emotion"" simulations they are doing these days.. that stuff will be greatly improved with more raw data, that wouldn't have been in the original transcripts."

"The only missing piece for AGI is having these models be able to run 24h, the capacity to know when they don’t know something, and the most important, be able to ask humans for anything missing they’d need in order to achieve their task.

"My complaint about Google is trying to figure out what is real and what can we use now. They are famous for releasing all kinds of fancy research papers but never releasing a real product. This reminds me of IBM in the 70's and 80's where they would tell customers all the great stuff they were working on in order to stall customers from buying competing products.

Not sure if others are getting a little bored with this approach or not. But I am tired of hearing how cool things will be. What I want to know is when is it available and how much does it cost."
