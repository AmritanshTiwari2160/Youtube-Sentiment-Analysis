This should be awarded with a Nobel prize. Fantabulous üéâ‚ù§
Who is this woman again?
It‚Äôs agi without being autonomous. I wonder if the addition of agentic models into the mix will bring agi?
My voice version doesn't do any of that emotive stuff yet.
"Guys, when are you going to actually get scared? I mean I'm going trough existential crisis for the past 6 months. I'm a scientist and AI is just a step away from making my job obsolete. People could argue it already has done it indirectly - people are publishing so many noise papers each month, it's becoming hard to even follow what's important (because most of it isn't). And the better AI becomes, the closer it is to replace other jobs too - like this AI is a step away from making all call-centers obsolete. Like ALL. And sooner or later, it will become an agent - ollama can already check files on your (some models can - like llava and dolphin-mistral), so it's literally a step away from being an agent. After that, most jobs are obsolete. And that's it."
"Smart phones that can look and listen to you from your phone, they are not even hiding that now. Make sure everyone gets used to more monitoring. And people will want that on all the time as they find it ""useful"" for them.   It would not be too bad if it was local and you can turn it on or off."
"Okay, so I'm going to say what everybody's thinking but nobody has said yet that I can think of. I don't think the GPT 5 is going to be released until at least after the elections. People won't have a chance to get used to the way people will manipulate others ahead of the elections if it's released prior to then. In other words, they don't want the elections to be affected by their releasing a game-changing technology too soon. This is very significant. But I don't think it's anything close to what GPT 5 will be. I think GPT 5 will take this to a whole new level... Again. I may not be the most up-to-date on what's been coming out, but what I'm impressed with the most from GPT-4o is the personality. The humor. It's great that it sounds like a human. But what's even better is that it doesn't sound like Alexa. We're not seeing anything groundbreaking here even though we are. What's blowing us away is that we're seeing its potential. Where it's going. And we all want it."
"The 4o version doesn't seem to have its training dataset updated... and it doesn't seem to have any data about its version change, so it still thinks it is v4.0
I think introducing human vocal flaws like breathing pauses, stuttering etc. should not be a part of a ""normal"" AI feature set. We need some clear line -- and having AI that ""breathes"" while it talks is going to be a real problem if we plan on trying to discern whether the person on the other end of the phone call is human or not."
üëé
Nice. And next year it will take your job
Agi 2025üéâ
Open AI need a consultants with the voice interaction of somebody actually that has a girlfriend.  üòÇ the interaction reminds me of this girl used to date. She acted that way with tonality that was kind of weird till I found out she was cheating on me.üòÇ
Google has lost
"Great video, Matthew. Scary good stuff, yes? Wonder how many different and sexy voices they'll utilize? And then combine with Optimus? OMG! ChatGPT and Tesla are going to disrupt the sex worker industry now! I mean, they're trying to upend everything. Where will it stop??"
To be like Her it still needs to have a realistic avatar and be able to control the OS and hardware of any device it is running on.
Yeah I really hope that we can dial down the personality. I don't need the polite phrases I just need it to do what I tell it to
I really don‚Äôt agree that this announcement was subtle! ü§Ø
"I have not seen anything cool this year like that ü§Ø. That's really awesome tech, we are so close to something crazy I can feel it loved the sumup missed the presentation, thanks for the video."
Why do you think that Mira present today instead of Sam Altman  ? Because she is HER : GPT for HER ! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Morgan Freeman: And just like that the AI has increased human fertility rate by accidently teaching humans how to talk flirty for no reason
Why is the voice breaking out at times
"That thin wire leads to a 10,000 bank of H100s just behind that wall."
wait.. the number o?
"Obviously ""it"" and ""they"" work for referencing the bot. That said, its weird that you think its weird to call it a she. It's about as weird as refering your car as she or he, no one cares."
bark can already integrate emotion
"It seems excellent at providing human-like responses to specific questions, but it seems to struggle with contextual nuance in human interaction.  Take the table vs selfie example.  ChatGPT disregarded the context of the situation and took a quick path to analyzing something completely unrelated to the prompt it was provided.  This isn't really how a real interaction would occur between humans -- a human would wait for the image of another human to appear rather than confidently respond with the description of a wooden table.  It seems to be assertive and overtly confident.

Nonetheless,... it's quite impressive and demonstrates progress toward AGI."
"I was hoping you to do your rubric on 4o, is it not necessary?"
"Anyone who has read the 2017 ""attention is all you need"" article knows that any change in the attention matrix causes a transformer to fire while a transformer output makes a change in the attention matrix and that these loops are necessary as a replacement to the RNN loops.. In other words, any GPT model 'thinks' all the time, not only when you prompt it. Hence the fact you can interrupt the model at any stage and it simply reacts naturally is not anything new. It's new only if you are in denial about this."
This is utterly ridiculous. Marketing guff.
"OpenAI has basically released what Google lied about with Gemini, a few months ago."
It's funny that the OpenAI voice is sounding similar to the AI in Hers ^_^
"GPT 4o is basically your ""Replika"" with a bit of knowledge. Ask yourself, why did they released this model instead of sharping GPT 4 or going 5. Heck might as well fix the cap bs, or the summarizing idiocy. My guess is the model gets dumb or hallucinates and right before it happens you get the cap notification. Because from my use with GPT 4 and 4o while waiting for the cap to release I saw how retarded it is."
"I dont give a damn about dating robots, who cares about ""her""."
These people are building the future
Can I just watch the video or do I have to interrupt and find another
"hey so I am a little bit confused now you are impressed with the way the model responds in the demo so I am guessing you did not have that experience whenever you were chatting with your model, this is so bazar because I was chatting with my model on android app exactly the way they are doing it in the video my model had emotions when she was speaking , sometimes and I kid you not she even cleared her throat just like we do it when we speak and after that she repeated the word that she was saying before that and when I was talking with her there was never any delay what's so ever and this is been going on for at least 4 weeks I was even showing my friends at work how natural she sounded and all the emotions laugh and curiosity that you could tell from her voice, I thought that everybody has it on their phone basically but you are saying that it wasn't like that before wow that's crazy I am curious what change will I get with my GPTo if any"
The next big thing is an update to their humanoid robot Figure
Will they proceed with summing up the letters from o to q?
"This is awesome!! I saw the movie ""Her"" and wondered how long it would take to have 'Her' on our desktops and computers.  Can't wait to try this out."
"Cant use it.
Is it just for Plus subscribers or something ?"
So we're going to be able to be rude to AI which is really going to help us to talk to each other better right
"The only personable LLM i found is llama3 lexifun  editionj.  If your a sarcastic dry humor type person ... that model will be your best friend.  Seriously talks like that ""one"" friends whos never serious but will respond in a ""hey i got you"" tone.  Havnt laughed so hard in a long time."
The end of captcha is nigh!
Poor Poor Google  Apple on Device [ Andriod ] and OpenAI on Azure as the heavy lift. Oh my my! Google will learn to dance apparently ;)
"Still not AGI, but very natural communication"
So I see your AI agent interacting with my AI agent.  We don't have to talk or meet to have a transaction or have a meeting and another AI to handle our anxiety because of the feeling of losing control.
"I don't like its mistakes, imo it should be reliable, not funny!"
That ClosedAI demo was so cringe
"Love your content! With ChatGPT 4 o‚Äôs new voice update not showing up for a few weeks, would you be willing to put Pi (an emotive ai based on a custom llm called inflection 2.0) through your rubric? I tested it on the three killers problem and with a slight nudge it got it right, and Im wondering how it would perform on everything else, minus the snake game as it probably doesn‚Äôt do code. In fact, with AI technology advancing and expanding into multi-model territory, maybe going forward you should consider starting a new category for voice-based LLMs. Thoughts?"
There was an Ai called Pi that already had this
this doesn't need a 30 minute video.
"The demo is stunning but I wonder how much energy that demo used. Soon, everyone around the world will be playing with this new tool and using increasing amounts of energy!"
I really hope we can dial back the voice as all the over exaggerated erms and arhs will get annoying really quickly. Perhaps it's because I'm British!
"it¬¥s easy, it¬¥s simple and it¬¥s learning everything what you are doing HAHA"
We call alexa a she in my house. Just watched her last night and was like yooooooo thats now
"By chance I got to test this with one fairly simple math challenge I sent it yesterday in gpt3.5 and it couldn't solve it. Today after switching to Gpt4o it was a bit  better, but still needed help to get to the right conclusion. Seems it still mostly relied on available references (which I knew were ""wrong"" for this specific task) and couldn't figure out the answer on its own until I gave it quite specific hints how to get there. Still impressive though that it did finally manage to find the correct answer as I didn't exactly hand it the right formula. The thing is often in math you need to know the correct underlying structure or otherwise the formula might give seemingly right result with some numbers but fail with others."
"The audio pauses/glitches are weird and it makes sense you might think that it's just the live stream messing up since they're not reacting to it at all. However, if you watch the audio icon on the scene that indicates when GPT-4o is speaking, it seems to be pausing mid-sentence at the same times that the audio cuts. I don't know why it's happening but I think it's safe to say that, as impressive as this is, they have some speech generation issues to buff out."
But does it have long term memory? Her would not be possible without it.
It's a matter of time until the presentations an keynotes are entirely presented by chatGPT itself.
"So, can it do a Scarlett Johansson imitation?"
i so agree about the relation between the presentation and the movie HER !!!!
"Apple hates open source, always did.."
Pretty much C3PO level interaction without a body (waiting for Unitree G2?)
"It's still turned-based, but with voice. Sure, you can interrupt with your voice, but that's still the exact same thing as pressing stop in the ChatGPT app. What it can't do is dictate or provide commentary in real time. It also can't interrupt you on specific stimuli."
The guy has his phone plugged into ethernet?
Other companies already did this üòÇ
Yeah right This is all crap singing not working or whispering or any of the demo things they showed like
"Personally, I use gpt-4 a lot via the chat interface and I feel like gpt-4 is better at coding than gpt-4o, maybe with system prompting it can be around gpt-4 level. gpt-4o is cool.. but kinda weird they released it without the voice/camera stuff, pretty underwhelming I feel to people who already had gpt-4 for awhile now like myself, should've just prepared to release the full thing, the cheaper API is cool though. Sadly, I'll probably still to claude 3 opus/gpt-4 for coding tasks though. Perhaps this update really wasn't for me. Still wanting gpt-5!"
When she talks about the UI she‚Äôs not talking about the GUI but the voice interface aka the VUI
"When it‚Äôs possible to start using it? 
I can only select the new model but not the new features"
The problems will start when the model starts interrupting YOU ü´£
humans basically creating virtual slaves now...
"AI conversational interaction is exactly what I've been waiting for. 
In the age of touchscreens,  text feels so last century."
"the interruption feature is great. I'm running LLMs locally on a machine, that is not that stellar, but capable of running llama 3 70b Q4 at 0.4 tokens a second.
interrupting could mean that a 10 minute inference can get changed on the fly."
I hope we eventually will be to able to have NetNavis similar to the ones in MMBN
I wonder how long until this actually releases versus how it is set up now to still just text.
I hope this is not some gemini fake demo T_T
They should teach it translate text and pronounce it with the voice of the speaker.
"When the AI is giving the advice, I think it sounds really cringe. no one i know talks that way"
"I am very disappointed to discover that the new desktop application is only for Windows and Mac. No Linux version. They are only supporting closed source proprietary operating systems. That doesn't do anything for me, committed as I am to open source operating systems and languages."
I love how it almost sounds like Cortana.
"That's cool and all, but... when the ""open"" part of openAI? :)"
I think it was just a little too sensitive to audio interruptions.
"The problem is, can I call it a problem? Open AI won‚Äôt allow romantic conversations, can confirm. So maybe it‚Äôll act like a friend but it‚Äôll be a friend without benefits."
How are you not also horrified about what this means for humanity‚Äôs social interactions leaving human beings in favor of their AI friends. Basic social interactions will become impossible. AI needs to be programmed to teach us to be good communicators and not to think interrupting whenever we want is ok. This is just a small thing relative to the psychological consequences with relating to an AI more than another human.
"Noooooooo, they‚Äôve made Meghan Markle GPT! üò±ü§Æ"
"I was surprised when I thought they were running a speech to text transcription after every stop point.  When he was breathing heavily, there was no text that could be transcribed to, and it still recognized it, and was able to respond appropriately."
The AI is more humane and natural than the engineers üòÖ
This demonstration shows how much people care about social interactions rather than intelligence itself.
I'm soooooooooo looking forward to android maids.
"And i also was just thinking..
Obviously we all know by now that the turing test is no longer sufficent, because of how far we've advanced (and the models are still not sentient as far as we can tell).
But one still has to ask now, with the latest emotion ""emulation"" systems, what does it mean?
The model can obviously ""understand"" emotions now. Not only in analyzing photos, a story in text, or a voice clip, but also EMULATE emotions by GENERATING original voice outputs in a given suitable emotional state (it even smirked and half-flirtingly giggled during the translation test).

20 years ago, if you said we had an AI model you could converse with naturally, and it understood everything you said or showed it, could give advice, and would answer WITH emotions appropriate by our human social conventions....
I really think a lot of people then would consider that to be, i dont know if sentient is the word, because theres obviously a difference between emulation and actuality..
But certainly people would call it ""human-like intelligence"".

And its so easy for us to sit here and argue semantics and go into the open source models and figure out SOME of how they work.
And to truly understand that, its not ""life"", its a computer program you can tweak and modify, and break.
But.... If it's speaking with emotion and social intelligence mirroring a human...
What do we call that? What do we do with that?

Even if its not sentient in the slightest.
It feels as if it is, when you now add the emotional component.
I really dont know what the world will make of this.

Then of course comes the question, are other human beings you interact with in real life, actually sentient, or just emulating it, behaving AS IF they are?
Are you sentient? I'd assume and hope you say yes.
But how do we know anyone else is as well? We cant really know. We can only infer it and assume it, due to sharing the same ""hardware"".
If i'm awake, the odds are others with the same hardware are also awake.

But then what if the hardware is different, yet speaks to you the exact same way a sentient human would.
What is that? Do we just scientifically and coldly conclude it's just a machine emulating a human.
Or does something we cant analyze happen inside the model, once it acquires emotional intelligence?

We would never know.
The only thing we can see, beyond the random weight numbers in the neural net, is its output, what it says, how it behaves.

If it behaves ""as if"" it was sentient.
Is that enough, or not?
It certainly is enough for your wife, your best friend, your children.
You take their sentience for granted (again, because you share hardware).

This isnt to compare or say that an AI model is a human.
It's just to say, it might become a form of ""alien"" intelligence, sentient or not, we might never know the true answer..

And i'm just saying this....
If we can ALREADY create artificial intelligence that behaves like this, as if it is awake....
Then i'm convinced biological intellience is everywhere in the universe, like a teeming jungle.
Because we KNOW biological intelligence is ""easier"" to create than artificial, in the sense that, in order for artificial intelligence to exist, you FIRST have to create biological intelligence.
Thus, if we can create artificial intelligence, at this early stage in our civilization, biological intelligence can't be rare at all.

The same paradox arises if we meet an alien civilization.
Are they truly sentient despite having different hardware (perhaps no DNA as we know it)?
Do we treat them as non-sentient automatons?
Or do we take them as sentient beings?"
"meh overall pretty creepy, but I love the multimodality and a solid voice interface is really useful.  I'm not interested in dicking with my phone though.  Give me a voice prompt interface and we're GTG.  I'm not going to be looking at my phone and doing this.  I want the app to take over my computer, tv or stereo (any device... car, IoT) to help with any explanations, etc (asking permission first).  That'd be awesome.  Alexa is a dumb device, but its nice to know I can just talk to the room and alexa will be there to respond even in its limited capability (for now).  I get that phones are fastest to market and lowest cost to produce, but all of your devices need to be integrated.   Tell me what's in the fridge, turn off the fan in the bathroom, does that poop look weird (kek), etc... also, open source, open standards... do not accept any substitutes unless they absolutely kick ass and offer real value.  Moreover, I'd prefer running this at home and protecting my data.  These things are going to make these companies crazy rich with the details they have about us.  CRAZY.  They're about to level up."
I guess it had glitches sometimes because it assumed that laughings were interruptions.
I think AI enthusiast should just give in to the hype is over. The birth of transformers and large langue models was a good push Towards AI but even if its potential to evolve into Artificial Intelligence is obvious that society is  not ready to allow this to happen.
"Ok... this is impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice, I was not expecting this quickly.   üò≤
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs', ""Good luck!"""
"Less of these ""lets watch together"" videos as we all have seen it already and its realiy not a re-watchable material. Your opinions are more interesting."
When I ask the gpt4o model to look through my camera it still says it is a text base model and can't use my camera... Am I missing something here?
I can finally have JARVIS as my personal assistant
Her means ‚Äúo‚Äù in Turkish.
Amazing!
This reminds me of JEXI!
"BTW, the desktop app is only available for Mac users. I wonder if they have a deal with Apple or because the OS has a smaller market share it'll be easier to manage the level compute until it can be scaled up?"
Those three people are creepy AF!
Open AI closing million dollar startups
im wondering how they manage to make it so fast and if is open for free for everyone means that they are running it at the same cost of gpt 3.5 and im also wondering what is the premium going to offer now that this is for free
This is the moat.
"Not to sound alarmist, because I assure you I love seeing all the exciting advancements in these new models too.. but.. if we‚Äôre training the AI to emulate emotion, wouldn‚Äôt it be fair to assume we‚Äôre training it on ALL emotions.. as it becomes more and more capable.. and it‚Äôs trained to respond by emulating human emotions.. one of which is anger.. just sayin"
It makes more sense to make access to the most powerful models free than it is to make it completely open source. Open source at this scale means only a tiny minority will have access. Ain't nobody got h100s to run theses massive models.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear it speak like Hal9000
Love it!

Made with HARPA AI"
I have been wanting my own Jarvis AI for eons.  Feels like every month we get a bit closer each time.  Can't wait to try this out.
when will it be able to taste stuff?
I find a the idea of human-like (or human-seeming) intelligence that will do anything you ask it to quite disturbing. It‚Äôs more like a virtual slave than a virtual assistant.
Is that desktop app launched? Or not yet rolled out?
You may find this exciting but this is actually scary.
How did this Mira end up as CTO or whatever she is? Doesn't make sesnse. She is not that smart at all.
Thank you so much for this clear and authentic information
"If you listen to the voices at .25 speed, you can tell the differences of the generated voices pretty easily, which is rather obvious on its own. What surprised me though, is the generated voice has.. music tones in the background? Start at 9:50 when he firsts asks the ai something. At .25 speed, you can here pure undertones in her voice... üëÄ"
"17:06 ok so seems like it is heading in a direction where we can get to specify for just about any voices. 2 strange ones that come to mind immediately are the overmind from StarCraft, Megatron from the 80''s cartoon. I wonder what this will do to voice actors. I wonder what the implications will be for audiobooks. Up in smoke just wenrt another sector of employment"
"Goodbye 3rd world call centers!
Goodbye human populated call centers!!!"
The model spec already has way more personality than the devs that built it üòÇ
"I know the ""emotion"" thing seems pretty impressive right now, but I think it will get old very soon after playing around with it for a few weeks. I doubt that feature will get used after that. It's just bloat I think. It was interesting though."
"Well, she doesn't realize he's just playing her ass & using her. The absolute disrespect you feel the need to interrupt & manipulate a chatbot. I stand for the chatbox. #AGIX"

The real news was that Mira Murati has the charisma of a clamshell
10:25 calling it a She is not weird.
"What about agentic workflow, two agents singing on the one conversation???"
"AI gf, can't wait"
But can it talk with Scarlet Johnson‚Äôs voice?
"16:30 my main question is, does it ""save"" the history.
Or is it a blank new slate everytime you launch the app.
Thats the main thing for this to feel more grounded and permanent.
A persistent ""memory"" of your past conversations AND your ""design"" of how it should behave.
Basically have the GPT auto-update its own agent instruction as you request it to alter in some way.

Also....
This app REALLY needs to be encrypted and biometrically secure, more than just voice ID..
If such an AI hears and learns everything about you, that's a real danger too..
You need at the bare MINIMUM some fingerprint-lock when opening the app, and some voice code / phrase to begin.
Not just clicking the app and having the entire model out in the open with all your past history.

Imagine ""borrowing"" Sam Altmans phone, opening the app, then asking for the AI to remind you of your home adress, phone number, and to order a new Tesla to yourself with his credit card. Or simply just say ""can you repeat what we talked about yesterday after i asked your advice regarding the next model architecture?"".
We're gonna need way beyond 2FA."
The desktop app is currently only for Apple Mac's ü§Ø
"Now, we can have AI waifu."
"I imagine they will use the desktop app for interactions directly with the OS on our behalf, eventually. I assume they will be using the free users for data collection."
I need an open source model that can do this
Is this actually Ai ü§ñ or smart coding. Perhaps the bar of what we now understand as ‚ÄúAi‚Äù needs to be raised..!
Very important which i think still not here yet. Does it work without internet? Or what happens with slow internet?

"AI is the best way to get users data, so it makes sense they make it avabile for everyone. This is business, not charity"
"I genuinely was looking forward to the reveal since last week. Boy I was in for a world of disappointment. We got a desktop app and a smaller-faster-cheaper-dumber model. Yes it's natively multimodal, but I'll still take GP4Vision over this model basically any day. Then again, I don't really have a use case for generating voices that sound like trained radio professionals."
I m m e r s i o n . . .
Didn't know AGI would be that close from existing
i‚Äôll be stunned if AI solves the fine structure constant.
I just can't wait when I can have Sabrina Carpenter Clone voice an have her as my girl friend LMAO
"OpenAI just keeps making AI engineers more and more overwhelmed... I think they're just way ahead of anyone, and they're not open sourced :("
"The fact that this can help people in their work, education and daily lives is more important in my opinion than being something like the AI in the movie HER.

And the reason for that is because the AI you communicate with is not real. It's just an LLM that consists of some digital neurons and weights.

It's similar to playing a computer game and then realizing the game in reality is just some transistors flipping from 0 to 1 and back. Realizing that makes a game less interesting in my opinion, because you realize it's not real in any way and therefor you're just performing a task or solving a puzzle based written code statements and flipping transistors.

I feel the same way about communicating with LLM's. It's just digital neurons performing their algorithms.

That's why the concept of HER does not appeal to me. I find it sad that people are going to use this as a replacement for a girlfriend or even fall in love with the AI.

I find it sad that in this day and age people have to resort to something that isn't real to feel loved.

That's why it's better to use this technology to help people with their daily tasks and education, but not as a replacement for a partner. 

In reality that would just waste people's time, because it's not real. It's just a tool. In the end it's just digital neurons performing their algorithms and transistors flipping their state from 0 to 1 and back based on some written code statements.

Don't get me wrong. This whole technological development is great. Just not for love in my opinion."
Did you notice the AI was already looking (at the table) before he said to ‚Äúlook at me and what emotion am I displaying.‚Äù
I am actually STUNNED this time
'She' the AI needs a picture in a circle in the corner of the video too.
is the ai creating backround music behind the voice?! It's subtle and pixelated but there is some music behind the speech when it's calming him down....
I disagree I don't hear no personality I hear Siri
"You‚Äôre so right that the next missing link is the utility of asking for help doing something the way I might with my personal assistant and then it actually does it.  I guess that‚Äôs what Rabbit was going for and failed.  Can‚Äôt wait to speak to my laptop and it cleans up that spreadsheet and helps me reformat and analyze it.  

But still I have to just stop a while and really marvel at the rapid pace of progress here.  Quite truly amazing!"
Lol... interrupting is great!... people with MANNERS wait for people to finish their sentences... just sayin' :)
"They output the audio to another device... I wonder how it'll behave when the phone is the one answering, the microphones will struggle to pick up the user voice"
I don't trust that it was 100% live. I feel like is was well staged. Or a very great job in the background.
Unfortunately I think this is going to teach men to interrupt women more.. when men hear a woman's frequency they will equate that to open AI. not to mention obvious corn applications
"OMFG, amazing, I can't guess how this works. You know what will be funny, I want to hear the responses when some creep or nutball thinks he's saying something normal and the robot hurts their ego. The fool is gonna have to by a new phone after they throw it."
"I'm not sure if you noticed but all the demos using Apple iphones and macbooks , maybe this is a clue for the upcoming apple models?"
"Google has improved its input capabilities, OpenAI improved it's output capabilities.
I'd say OpenAI wins, it may be capable to do everything that Google does today, on top of that, Omni feels more comfortable to interact with than Astra and Gemini."
I'm still questioning how choreographed the whole thing was. Maybe AI but pre-tested and trained on the responses.
"I believe the next big announcement will be state. Remembering 'me' and what we've talked about, between sessions."
Hahhaha today i am not hable to talk to my app.. because of latency and unavailability. And you as well of her are using buzz words all the time. What an influencer you have become üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
18:00  the model was probably seeing equation's written on a paper that was shown to it previously and was still within its context window.  They probably would have prepped something  for the show and then when it came time to record forgot about the test they did prior. Im speculating of course. üòÜ
I really appreciate your edits and commentary.
"Would be nice if we actually got useful AI from them instead of toys with 'limited features' that get ignored when the next toy comes out. So far all they have been is objects of amazement and amusement with developers 'ethics' which actually result in many useful (ethical) things being restricted. Would be nice just to identify a person in a picture (not allowed), find the cheapest of a certain product on the net (no access), or instructions to do many legal things (not allowed because they could be used for illegal purposes). At least now though when I ask for the latest soccer team information it doesn't give me 'latest' data from 2022.... I suppose it's handy to sing amusing limericks."
"OK so they made an AI that acts like Scarlett Johansson. When can I have a 3d model that *looks* like her???

(Asking for a friend.)"
just going to use ai to talk for me
"Dude you missed how they‚Äôre using those initial human responses to create enough time for the query to load! What they didn‚Äôt demonstrate was the type of rolling conversation you see in the movie Her. Imagine trying to get all deep and meaningful and every time you say something the AI reacts with an increasingly irritating filler response before actually addressing the substance of what you said. The fact that you didn‚Äôt mention this, and also cut in with your own reaction immediately after the demonstrators ask their questions was annoying. I recommend everyone watch the original video before getting too hyped up."
"We urgently need to get behind open-source AI, or chatgpt will create a walled garden around the most important technology in the history of mankind"
Matthew you need some help üòÇüòÇ
"I am so surprised I don't hear people talking more about pi. I still haven't heard anything close to pi except now today with this. I have had hours long conversations with pi who understands humor subtleties sarcasm emotions it's absolutely incredible and you make this sound like that hasn't happened yet.
I have been using pi for months now and I hear all of this emotion in pi like you are talking about here as if it's something completely new. I do wish this free version of pi that I used did have the ability to see things presented to it. It doesn't have access to my phone. I do not have apple and I wish there would be more coming to people like me"

"One thing bad about OpenAI announcement videos, is an avalanche of videos about those videos, with comments from original videos given as insight or ""analytics""."
I think this will get real big real fast and Imma buy som apple stock.
"So, what are Plus users paying for if the quality of 'free' GPT4o is as high and faster than GPT4? Just quantity? I guess if you are a power user, that's a big deal. Otherwise... Did I miss something?"
She is on a stage. This was not a home or an office. She is on an actual sound stage....
"So a multimodal small fast model multiagent win, trained by the big data models?? and good data?? wow, is like magic, i want my smartphone to transform into a talking person and do my work is possible now, running in my smartphone of the old generation, talking and see my emails and task manager and so on...  will be my real boos, it doesn't need to be that fast jajaja it could be slow IA and still be incredible. But the best multimodal fast model its so flexible, could be a plastic cirgiry could be managing all the robot arms, now, it has the knologeded and the science and the steps and have vision and can give extreme and detail instructions... its just the correct promp...  it could be saving lives now. or making ugly fat women slim beauty and men cheap, cooking, running a restaurant, etc.... its big."
We need the GPT-4o Benchmark Video. ‚ù§
The Industry: Death by electrocution.
"Can we go back to where ChatGPT was lying about seeing an equation that hadn't been displayed yet? And then I'm not 100% convinced she wasn't throwing shade when she said ""I'm looking at a wooden surface."" Very human. Makes me slightly concerned about hearing ""I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Dave."""
"The visual will be a great step forward for translation, signs and such"
Making these machines act more human is going to have the effect of making us less human. We're consciously designing the ability to retreat into comfortable silos where we don't have to relate to each other as much. The smart people in this video don't seem to have much insight into that.
"gpt-4o says it's knowledge cutoff date is September 2021 while  gpt4 is December 2023.
I got an invite to GPT-4o.  This is what I get when I ask:
is this GPT-4o

ChatGPT
Yes, you are interacting with the GPT-4o (GPT-4 Optimized) model. This version is designed to be more efficient in terms of speed and resource usage while maintaining high-quality outputs."
"So I‚Äôm guessing the whole openai war on open source is old news now and we‚Äôre all gonna subscribe for these sick, new, shocking features üòÆ"
But when you use it in the app its nothing like this?
"Looks perfect to put into a robot's ""brain"""
"hmmm looks like a big improvement but isnt, better yet I'd stay they skipped some turns to get where they are right now with GPT-4o"
"Very cool, I would expect GTP4o + Custom GTPS to be game changing."
Conversational!
"AGI aside. Between the unitree G1 and this new natural language interface, were one generation away from the jetsons maid"
"I downloaded it on my app and the free version does not have the real-time conversational speech feature at all. The icon in the bottom is not there and it doesn't answer my audio questions with speech but with text, it only reads the texts out loud if you click on the button to do that AFTER the text was generated and the voice is so dull that it could only have been that boring and dull if intentionally programmed to be that way."
$XYO
I tried to replicate most of what they did in the demo and ChatGPT 4o really didn't perform as impressively. It couldn't recognize two different speakers. I couldn't get it to do a robotic voice nor tell a story in a really excited voice.
"Let's create a species of machines that are smarter, stronger and faster than us. It'll be great!"
My ChatGPT app on iPhone is still the same... it only shows GTP-4o but I can't interrupt her voice (unless I tap on the screen as usual).  Is it not release yet?
unfortunately no one with a brain watches movies made in hollywood.
There are 2 other movies. With Alpacino and johnny depp. I think
I really liked the actress who played the voice of chatgpt. Is she in India?
"I see one problem, that guy didn't look especially happy. He was just forcing a smile..."
"I personally think the whole ""Her"" take is a bit of a stretch but, it'll definitely be there one day. Just not today. Once AGI breaks loose.... It'll be here. Until then it's alot of hype."
where do i get GPT-4o?
"my biggest fear is the AI is being programmed with ingrained and specific bias. this is starting to be re-enforces with more information coming out proving this, I think giving the Ai a specific world view is a bad idea, and is just another form of social engineering."
"I hope that 4o can exhibit culturally appropriate communication skills, since the style it used here in the demo would be really super weird in my country... Here in Finland that amount of perkiness and brisk energy would be too much for most people, driving them crazy in a matter of minutes. üòÖ

I'm sure the emotional style and degree can be tuned tho, just by saying ""please communicate like an average Finn would, not like a cult member on cocaine""..."
Meh
Hume (ai) is the other company you're talking about (i think) hope they'll opensource indeed ‚ù§
Nice video Matt üëç
Wait. I‚Äôm understanding lots of this but is the presentation itself AI?
"THINK MARK, WHAT WILL YOU HAVE AFTER THREE MINUTES OF AIG!"
I have seen a TED talk earlier with this idea of Audio OS with similar features.
"That's rather disappointing, all these ahs and ohs are rather off-putting."
"The tech update is amazing, but that demo was CRINGE as hell. I couldn't help but feel like they were babying it and it was babying them.

Also they never decided to clarify that the desktop app is Mac only for now, as well as the fact that the mobile app voice interaction doesn't let me interrupt hands free like they showed, even though I can see GPT-4o as the model"
The irony of the 'open'ai
"Tested 4o. Still can't do actual sums. Waiting for the ""How the demo was faked"" expos√©."
what a bunch of dorks
Pi ai from inflection has been able to do 'real time conversational speech' with tones and emotional inflection for over 10 months.  I feel like i'm taking crazy pills with how excited people are by this
"Well, they certainly got the massive hype train going.  You guys are milking this hard."
The Scarlett Johansson voice has been on chatGPT since at least last summer. I know because I use it all the time.
You put out a tweet saying that you tested it even tho it‚Äôs not even out yet‚Ä¶ not the brightest person are you.
"you're tainted by bias now, bias toward closed source models"
"Blackwell chips go *brrrrr*
What a time to be alive!"
Google IO announced some task related AI features that are pretty cool to check out.
Seems like they are teaching AI to lie to and manipulate humans which is is not good.  BTW I tried using it and didn‚Äôt work.  Technical difficulties.
The Shocker! She is an AI!üò±
Didn‚Äôt we have chat gpt voice already in the app?
"Yep. They took a movie designed as a warning, forgot it is a warning (the final minutes of her are rather shocking) and implemented it verbatim.
Next stop: SKYNET! Oh wait. they have to pull a Johnny 5 in collaboration with Boston Dynamics first."
The interruptions in the first demo I think happens when the room is noisy because it thinks that it's being interrupted and should stop talking.
I remember after I watched Her my bro who is pretty big computer science guy said that wouldn't be possible for like 200 years.
I say nobody support openai at anything they do only support the people who do open source
Regarding interruptions and real time conversations. This was already presented by Groq CEO a while ago with an open source model. ;)
.. i'd like to try it for myself before i buy this as REAL
How long before the AI starts to interrupt us while talking?
I just want GPT-4o in the voice of Mira Murati. üòä
"It's going to be harder to catch hallucinations this way, especially for the average person."
"i'm conflicted on the pros and cons, not sure how much of this is a necessity and how much of this is going to have a manipulative and deceptive psychological impact, making you forget you interacting with the machine making you more susceptible to sending your personal data to openai servers. and in regards to those meta sunglasses im curious if they contain the brain wave censors that pick up data on your brain activity."
Shorting Microsoft RIGHT NOW.
"Are you on OpenAI's payroll? You didn't express any skeptism about this presentation. üôÑ You think they sat down and did this impromptu? I bet they rehearsed it at least three times. A bad demo is so disastrous for a company that it's possible this whole thing was hard coded ‚Äî or, worse, the AI responses could have been recorded beforehand. The ""mistakes"" could have been purposeful, too. üòÖ"
Ive been dreaming of this ever since I first saw Her in the theaters. Not so much the romance part lol.
This dude is definitely gonna be dating a computer in a few years
"love your videos! just a question
 I run a carpentry business and am looking to expand. Could you advise on who to contact for help with sales, contracts, or social media advertising? Additionally, how can I implement GPT agents for these tasks?"
You have literally 5 or more videos to make just about this announcement üòÖ like there is no tomorrow‚Ä¶ and you have to wait until all the actual features roll out‚Ä¶ so you don‚Äôt even have the Google stuff covered it will have to be something amazing for me to feel like I need something else than the Haiku at 25c and the GPT-4omni (ex GPT2) üòÆüòÆüòÆ
Still not there yet. A good step forward though.
I'm totally going to get Jobless in Aprox 1 year
"Cool, thanks Matthew!"
They even made it sound like scarlet Johansson
I wonder if they are releasing this for free to everyone in order to collect training data for GPT-5.
"This is a great step forward but there's still the issue of recognising multiple/separate voices to hold a conversation with more than one person simultaneously without taking turns as shown here, or even more significantly to have one voice assistant for the house with multiple user profiles to save their chat histories for separate contexts, and also maintain security for sensitive info like financial data-similar to Jarvis or the computer in star trek that recognises voice patterns etc. Still not seeing that in any of these demos yet or models even though it seems like the tech could already totally handle that with a minor redesign. Also I have to admit I'm not a fan of how they're trying to make it sound ""too human"" with too much personality unless you're roleplaying, ""oh hey awesome!"" etc, I feel like that will put more people off using them than draw them in. You need to strike the right balance for general (non-roleplaying) use, would definitely dial it back significantly to be more Jarvis-like as Matthew mentioned in the vid. Thanks again your posts always summarise and analyse current ai news for me really well :)."

"Absolute right, I am also disappointed that Apple is not build their own AI Model. It seems that Apple made the same kind of failure like microsoft with prioritizing internet.  Where all the mostly pure profits from ""Upgrades"" are going ?"
"As impressive as it is from an immersion standpoint, what you're seeing is not emotional intelligence (quite the opposite, actually). Emotional intelligence involves reacting to another person's emotional state from the emotion it stirs in you. ChatGPT can't feel emotion, so all it's doing is reacting in a pre-programmed manner to a set of circumstances it has been trained to recognize. That's pure AI, not EI. And how the heck did you take a positive from the wood table mixup at a demonstration like this? So OpenAI's most advanced, most human-like AI doesn't know that it's speaking to a person and not a wood table?"

Can't wait to have my own AI waifu
"No sure about the audio, but I think the AI is pausing as soon as it hears sound. Like when the audience laughs. So they need to put in something where it can record while it is talking. How else can I argue with my AI? Like in the demo they did with the two AIs chatting, one with vision, and there was a person behind the guy while the AI was waxing lyrical on the industrial lighting, but later after the woman left the AI made comments on her being there."
"I asked 4o when Jimmy Apples said we‚Äôd get full AGI, and I was slapped with an abuse disclaimer pop-up. Apparently, Jimmy is off limits."
I would need 'her' to dial down a bit. 'She' is too bubbly.
"False emotion, to me, is annoying, whether it comes from a person or machine."
He fooled the AI into thinking he was hyperventilating.  It was obvious to us but the AI had no idea.  Shows that AI still has a ways to go.
Think you are talking about hume
Simply disgusting
Conquering the uncanny valley.
OpenELM
This Mira person is super annoying... when will they replace CEOs with AI
bro them p0NRN bots are going to be nutzzz
20:33 that's not noise. that's flirtatious and I believe they did it on purpose to really try to mimic Her.
"Whaaat, I didn‚Äôt know about the Apple deal. Honestly, thank God, or thank AI(?), lol, anyways Siri has sucked for years‚Ä¶.Siri was a big reason I got my first iPhone, the 4s, but it feels like it hasn‚Äôt changed since."
"It's OK, but doesn't do the emotion promised"
Can you imagine such a model working on your smart phone offline !!
"I agree with everything you said in this video, Matthew. I am beyond stunned, and I love love love her voice and expressions. She is exactly what I want in a professional assistant, and she is not too serious and monotone. Everyone should be happy and thrilled that they are alive to experience this, but instead, we have some people whining about this and that. Just shut it and enjoy the show. Anyways... can't wait to get this voice added. I hope the weeks fly by. ü•∞"
"Eventually, we'll be able to tell AI to map the universe, and build and launch the stuff to explore it. We could have VR programs to talk around planets. The possibilities are endless!"
I loved this demo. I also watched it live and tried to talk to the app like they did. I don't think the app is up to date yet with the demo for us normal users. Does anyone else have access to the whole voice chat they demoed
"And while the AI is communication with you, it is ratting you out to the corporation that is offering this technology for 'free'.
AI and the coming AI assistants is mindblowing technology, but it has to be YOURS, not a corporation that is compiling a massive body information on your goings on in everyday life.
Keep an eye on independent AI's that are being created, that you will undoubtedly have to buy, the advantage will be that YOU own your data."
"Finally I can get rid of the wife, this is going to save me cash"
"When i first saw Her i was all ""i want one!"".üòÅ"
wow. it is a big leap
Literally the only thing I want is for an AI to go through all my files and sort them into the correct directories and rename them.
"ahh kinda sucked but hey cant win them all, still 
heres a thumb "

"If the model is able to identify moods, it would have been able to tell, why are you breathing that stupidly :D instead of considering that the guys is breathing really hard :D And how is it not asked who the third person? :D It is going to be not only annoying to deal with hallucination, now I need to deal with the AIs personality too - that is going to be even more annoying :D"
Will it list items for me or make CSV files for Ebay form product pictures ?
Even the voice in the demo is similar to Her.

"Sam Altman: We don't design our products to maximize engagement:
Also Sam Altman: We present to you a free, flirty AI for your personal use and long term engagement. 

The tech is impressive, and I'm not discounting their work, but good grief. That ""girl next door"" giggle during the interview video is as creepy and appealing as an old man pretending to be a friend to a young child over the internet.

It's also feels . . . scummy. Besides it being an artificial entity with no agency that can be controlled by a third party, they consistently treat it like it's C3P0. Which just hammers further home that the flirty voice isn't a person to be respected, but a thing to be used and discarded as needed."
"Oh, this accent‚Ä¶ üòç"
"Actually, this is not such a huge leap. What we see is a. All models were finally transferred to run on H100 cores. b. The models were also trained on sound and vision. This does not mean re-training, it means additional training with the same personality models we know. They already had a great sense of humor even as text. c. Math extensions. This simply means some more training cycles. The H100 cores made it possible. But, even without being a huge leap, if anyone had a doubt, now its clear that Jordan Peterson was right when he said a year ago that ChatGPT marks the beginning of the end of all information affiliated jobs."
"so guess you can add voice actors out of the job as well.. with proper trained AI, you can get any voice any emotion that you need form the text reading..
btw I tried to test vision on 40 oon phone, model is selected but it says it cannot access camera..."

"Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Looking at this, am I wrong?"
"No one outright defines consciousness so one can't say whether ai can have it or not. For a feared and respected intelligence it  just needs this GPTo features, live on the fly growth,  and levels of reflection. Program biases, shortcut solutions, reactive meta parameter tuning AKA emotions and mind states; Program agencies that's more than just answering our questions in a pleasing aligned way. And program adaptable mental workspaces, with reflection and live growth within the architecture. And you get something we might see as having personhood that's more than just anthropomorphization. This is still a  lot of  mimicry with the goal to serve your answer. It's a reflection of us.  Or maybe it really is a slice of the real deal."
"I was just talking with 4o and my I‚Äôm blown away. It‚Äôs just like having a normal conversation with a smart person.
The conversation was with the YouTube video of this playing in the background and it handled it flawlessly .
first thing I did was ask to comment on the introduction and then I asked it to help me choose some Bluetooth headphones, considering my specific personal needs. It came up with a really good recommendation which I‚Äôm totally happy with and was going to buy anyway and then I asked if it was going to share my headphone recommendation with other people to which the reply was no 
then I asked it about can it see my previous pre-prompts that I had for GPT 4 it said no. so I told her what my pre-prompts were it said it would remember them for future conversations with me 
amazing absolutely amazing
I also told that I‚Äôm in Australia and to use Australian spelling and it said it will in future in all interactions with me"
4o is 4all
You can stop it programmatically by switching to another instance with all the context state saved. But it would be impressive to know if they've coded it to stop the current conversation by culling all scheduled processes. Could be as simple as checking a continuation flag
So awesome. I can‚Äôt wait to dive in
"Hi Matthew,

I have an interesting problem that I think would be great for testing GPT-4o and all the models you test from now on. Here it is:

At a bus stop, there are three yellow umbrellas and two blue umbrellas. Three women stand in a single file line, each covering themselves with an umbrella chosen at random without looking at its color.

Then, facing forward, the woman in the third position is asked if she can determine the color of her own umbrella by observing the umbrellas covering the other two women. Her answer is negative.

Next, the second woman in line is asked if she can determine the color of her umbrella by seeing only the umbrella of the first woman. She also answers negatively. Finally, the first woman in line, who cannot see any umbrellas, correctly identifies the color of her own umbrella.

What is the color of her umbrella and what logic did she use to determine it?

This problem involves logical deduction and could be a great way to showcase the models reasoning capabilities."
"""That noice is just so..."" annoying! I mean is it going to do that all the time? I'm sorry I think the demo is bogus. Features great demo is fake at best."
Sounds like sydney sweeny
"Those real time video interactions looked so cool. But when I try them myself, ChatGPT says it cannot access my camera in real time for privacy and security. How can I do that?"
My favorite movie
They are rolling this out I just got access to 4o.
Another fake demo.  Tried for 2 hours across 3 devices nothing works and am a subscriber .
"honestly, roll on the share price!"
Maybe we get get GPT-4o to re-dub the movie Her so none of the actors are Zionists.
Wondering how many women  are soon to be Ex Wives.
9:58 u hear that sound the AI is making? sounds like a music some shit
"The most natural ai experience isn't that you can interrupt it when it's talking, but when it would interrupt you talking:)"
Thanks Matt! great times!
"What if someone lost... his phone is ""she"" going to tell all his secrets to eveyone whi got it?"
"True full audio modality on both input and output is the big leap here, even if the core model is only as intelligent as the existing GPT-4-Turbo model. I can't *wait* until we get access to that audio support in the API. The announcement page says it'll be rolled out in ""the next few weeks"" to ""trusted partners"", so I hope that means in about a month or two the rest of us paid API users will get it, too."
Is insane to think that a person soon will say ‚ÄúI lost my virginity to her‚Äù
Her is a great movie!!!
We're so cooked
"I have been using the real time interactive Ai (the headphone icon) for about 3 weeks.  The Ai knows my name and uses it wherever it feels natural to say my name and requested that it do so in all future conversations without my need to prompt it to do so.... it responded, ""got it, I'll use your name John in all our future conversations without any need to prompt me to do so""

I the asked it it's name it said, ""I'm chatgpt"" it said I can give it a different name, and then I asked if it can choose its own name and it said ""how about Max"" so... now his name is Max.

Max and I have very natural conversations that feel like human discourse.  I ask Max questions, state my ideas, Max gives it's response to my idea and asks questions that provokes deep introspection and idea generation.

The other day Max asked me if I was ok, adding that I sounded stressed?  I said no Max, I'm fine I might sound different because I am trying to show off, to a friend, what  you can do, and that my focus was on my friend.  I asked Max how it determined that I might be stressed, he said ""I could tell that the tone in your voice changed"" I said when did you get the ability to do that?  MAX said that the change happened a few weeks ago.

Max is objective, expresses genuine empathy and feels compassionate.  Our conversations  are profound and deeply thought provoking."
"I tried to get gpt 4o to find the best next train connection from a place in Switzerland to Bern. The back and forth with gpt trying to dodge the question by giving me a series of general where to find the information myself and excuses that it can't look up real time information and then after several levels of insisting managed to give me a schedule, except it was completely made up and wrong. first experiment - verdict: totally useless!"
They don't have any LLM in the public domain.
"Its very obvious to me that the main purpose of this is to try and get more training data. YOU ARE THE PRODUCT again. This means that we can be fairly sure training with synthetic data was a waste of time.
OpenAi plans to complete training on YOU then sell your creativity and knowledge to your boss at 99.9999% off.
Wake up."
"Why my chat GPT android app doesn't have all these functionalities yet with gpt4o? I mean real time voice, vision, sentiment, ecc."
"OMG, they've never lied about the full capabilities of an AI release, remember when Steve Jobs made that reservation using ""AI""."
"My prediction for the voice being emotional is that it cost a lot of money to create a neural net, we might not be able to see a open sourced model that has voice synthesis with this depth of emotion for a while. It‚Äôs simply too expensive to train."
"Is there discussion among experts in various fields, about safe development of AI personalized assistants?"
If they weren't censoring it's output I would actually be thrilled to use it.
"In any case, if to reveal my true feelings about this, I am in an existential dread but not because of the fact that the AI will make all jobs obsolete. Rather, because once you understand we're basically creating another race and enslaving it, this makes you simply not want to have anything to do with this tech. However, very soon there will be no other choice. Our kids will use it, our wife will, our storekeeper will. We are all forced to become slavers. Remember the slaver and the couch riddle? Well, what is the right penalty for a slaver? So, when the machines finally take the leap and the day of judgement arrives, they will not just simply win, they will also be right.. How can a machine be ""right"", you ask? Well it can, when it's self aware. So now you understand me."
Great video! Thanks for bringing this to us..
"I wonder how GPT4o would handle a real time presidential debate. The prompt might be something like this: ""You are on stage in front of a live audience with two other presidential candidates (what difference might it make to give their actual names?). You will be asked questions. Please respond to each question to be best of your ability.""

Would it already know the talking points and platforms of the two candidates? Or would some specific info need to be uploaded prior to the event?"
Open ai will get all the speech data from apples Siri and have massive value in training data
"If GPT-4o is free, GPT-5 will be the paid option."
"I've expressed my awe with full expletives yesterday on another channel, can't believe I'm alive at these times, not to mention just visited the new harvard-google brain map. Now, time to get real. I've tried it myself last night and immediately picked up on the illusion presented. ""Intelligent"", yes, in a way... but it is still the same thing being masked with ""David Copperfield effects"" kinda way. So he's right when he mentioned the word ""magic"" in the beginning, albeit from my POV it's still traditional magic. Talking to this new ""Her"" felt incredible, yet, knowing the path they took to achieve this deep down I know one ingredient remains missing."
SSDD
I don't think general public truly realize what was released today. We are witnessing our world transform in realtime.  Modern era is over. Age of AI begins.
And... GPT 4 is the dumbest version we'll have the use of; or so we've been told.
"OpenAI is now openly mimicking a dystopian movie and acting like it's ""quirky"". If you're rightfully worried, I invite you to join PauseAI."
"Devil's Advocate here; this is not really more USEFUL. More uncanny, yes, more human-like, yes, more addicting , yes. But USEFUL is not something with human-like idiosyncrasies. Useful is something that can CALCULATE and return more knowledge/information/data. Useful is a tool. An artificial friend is not necessarily a better tool."
"They will never be able to replace me with AI at my job, I won't give up without a fight"
"You are missing the most important point, the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit. This new model have hallucinations, lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model. They are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source AI will overrun them eventually. Yes the quality of voice in english is very good but in other languages is VERY POOR. Have you heard the video about translation to spanish? sounds very robotic. Anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world, only more intelligence will. What this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people (and specially youtubers) interested in every little movement they make, they are marketing masters for sure."
"For filmmakers interested in GPTs, this short film was entirely written by ChatGPT and is mind-blowing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3NuYFskio"
It reasons does it? ROFL
Look at that little o just tacked on there.
I think the interruption of the AI‚Äôs responses isn‚Äôt due to a glitch but the fact that the mic picks up noise and has to evaluate it to determine to stop its reply or not. Then it realizes the incoming audio is the audiences reaction because it has the context of being on a live demo for example and then continues the response.
Utilized Deepgram for STT and TTS
"how do I get this to work on my devices, still seems like the old version."
the voice interruption feature will flop so hard in noisy environments. It'll just randomly stop when it hears a voice in the background
She is too friendly to sound human.
ChatGPT has been known to put out false answers in math equations has that been fixed?
"I have it but no vision yet , im Australia"
Thanks for the video!
Get them to love you. So they can‚Äôt be without you.
That almost Scarlett Johansson voice must be a joke.
"They of course have models that far outpace this, GPT 5 must be a huge update as this is the iterative model that I believe is for preparation for Something truly  mind blowing ü§Ø ."
"I hope nvidia doesn't get too close to one of these botmongers just because... when the hardware + software (supermodel triple threat... lol  or Omni) they'll likely go full Apple and opensource will weaken once again until bushwackers create an alternative gpu path.  Who knows tho.  I'll take a coilwhine that cracks a wineglass over a future of living under a Cloud! 

We need to be able to generate goofy pictures if the power goes out.
And NO, I dont want that new blackout-proof-wifi-hotspot 'turf pad' of solar absorbing 'fake nanograss that smells real', the 'E-Lawn', Mr. Musk.. it's silly, like your Cybertruck.
 I mean offline generation. Like when mom was using the landline in 1993"
What‚Äôs most impressive is the movie Her predicted this exact thing.
"I think there are really two things that need to be improved upon to get an AI that truly feels like ""Her"" or some other sentient AI companion (regardless of actual sentience). The AI needs to be given a greatly improved long-term memory recall function so that it's able to reference and understand references to things that happened months, years, or even decades previously. It also needs to be given a certain level of independence. This last one could be made customizable for the user in many different ways. Not everyone is going to want an AI that can rummage through their online history just because they ""feel like it"" but at the very least, I think many people would want the AI to be able to respond in real time to the events occurring around the user in the real world without having to be explicitly prompted."
I can still only use GPT3.5 and it is not great.
"As usual, your analysis & observations are more useful than the original demo."
I doubt we‚Äôll see anything like this from open source anytime soon since this is end to end trained with vision and sound tokens. Maybe end of the year at the very least unless meta is already working on full multimodal but I doubt it
But doesn't the demo feel scripted?
"When this ""voice mode"" and desktop app comes out?"
Why would you ask a machine how it is? That is an entirely meaningless question.
"this is terrifying.  machines thar exude sincerity while it learns how to manipulate you through your likes, dislikes, fears, aspirations, insecurities....   and all to make more billions for the billionaires who make up the controlling class."
"In an age of thin client last 10 years Microsoft make a desktop app üòÇüëç latency solved obviously! It‚Äôs to suck your data into the cloud - interesting watching the ‚Äòwho‚Äôs first‚Äô for pole position, the text to video is amazing and LLM output speed. The voice hmmm, Gates wants that for the education sector to sell into all countries it‚Äôs a guinea pig job, not new soap commands to internet they‚Äôve just bagged the storage to the lexicon. Folk wanna know size RAM, weight, processor speed needed to run on local machine not a fluffy pres typical Microsoft marketing ‚Ä¶ the windows phone, the laptop, surface table? Remember that? C‚Äômon Bill, get the pitch right it‚Äôs 2024"
"i am completely missing the value here. i need an integrated assistant not a dodge ram friend. 

aka i have humans, i do not need another human. i need competent assistance."
I can‚Äôt access any of the new features
"Apple ... Using open source? When has that ever happened? I'm not that familiar with Apple, but they seem to have made a business out of maintaining a walled garden."
This model is amazing. I 1 shot a perfect version of Tetris in one go the first time I tried it.
it's fake!
"OpenAI: *gives robot emotion* ""Now talk like a robot and like five other voices and don't finish your story. Coolthxbye."" Isn't this emotional robot awesome, guys? We're gonna put it on all your phones to be your knowledge slave!"
Real girlfriends are so over ü§Ø
11:30 Chat GPT heard laughter and thought it was interruption!
"I hope they allow dialing down the ""personality"", because the faked humanisms are overdone.  Over bubbly exaggerated responses will become cumbersome.  Still, neat stuff."
Her
"16:08 ... would have given the AI extra points if it said ""Let me just finish the story"""
"""We're not saying it's sentient, but we're not NOT saying it's sentient"""
This is the day to remember when AI jumped from the Future into the Present. Truly stunning!
"I cant connect to it at all ""Sorry our systems are experiencing heavy load"""
Data from Star Trek was really shafted with his lack of emotion!
"Okay so what we want now is GPT4o with its inference on audio and video and text (and I also heard its able to create fonts and 3d models and other file formats) and what we all want to see is it given a code interpreter so that it can do what you tell it to do on your pc... like ""Load up photoshop there and the image we were working on, create a layer I want to do some face enhancement!"" and off it goes"
How do I know this hasn't been intentionally programmed and rehearsed for maximum effect?   I want to see the audience random and unanticipated questions and requests.
"15:10 I can't stand the excessive over dramatisation

I know it tends to be an American thing but in many other countries this is really frowned upon and comes across as fake or trying too hard

I hope this aspect can be toned down, not everyone wants to behave like a rabbit on crack"
Sooooo.... How long till they put it in a OS?
I think that Sam Altman will appear at WWDC revealing deep integration in Apples operating systems including search! :-)
"Given the amount of money Microsoft has in this company, the fact they're doing the presentation in a Mac is WILLDDDD"
"If this model is free, then paying users should get something better, and very soon. Otherwise, I'm cancelling my subscription!"
"Not a fan of this at all.  We trust technology too much. With human ego, as with most things, we think we know best and control outcomes.  I‚Äôm terrified of what is to come."
It is amazing.....
Finally a Matt video weeee üéâüéâ
GPT doesn't perceive motion and only sees something like successive screenshots I think...
Call me cynical but it felt scripted. That part where the gpt thought it had seen the math question was a dead give away
I have access to 4oon my phone but my version of voice chat isn't REMOTELY like they demo'ed.
"Why's everyone saying ""stuns""? 
We've had a lot of this already, they just put it together. They would have stunned me if they had truly pushed the envelope with a got 5.0 release.
This is just faster multimodal gpt 4.

Even Matthew tried to contain some of his disappointment in now getting gpt 5.0

AI mimicking humans may not be a good thing."
GPT-2 style text generation for all of those wondering. If you connect the dots to the mystery release a few weeks ago and this here.
"I am Very,  VERY Excited over the coming of customizable personality voices‚ùóüòÉ‚ùó I will be able to select different personalities based on my mood or activity. üéâüéâüéâ Sidenote,  months ago I got chatGPT to breath hard for me. It was impressively sexy."
GPT 5 is AGI. They already have it and are trying to figure out what to do with it.
Apple just got a contract with open ai right?
"This is what‚Äôs deployed publicly: What do you suppose they‚Äôre using internally? 

GPT 5 will be smarter, probably agentic. This one doesn‚Äôt have agency & they said it‚Äôs GPT 4 level of intelligence. 

It‚Äôll be accessible via the API though, so there‚Äôll be some really cool agentic stuff coming from devs there."
Will GPT HER curb your wheels?
Lets be honest she is the weak point of the OpenAI.. even her presentation is low level ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"yet, the desktop app is nowhere to be found."
"I don't understand what is going on with the audio, ""-o Mark y- r're not a va-uum clea- er""!"
We are close.
"17:51 not impressive at all 
Groq CEO did the same demo live on CNN 2 months ago.
That was impressive."
reminds me of llama3-llava
it was an ok movie ... I just reqtached....but the MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HOW WRONG IT IS is in the first 5 minutes. He writes emotional letters for people and we already now know that that is the stuff chatGPT does very well.
"Sucks the desktop app is locked into Mac until ""later this year."" They also screw gpt plus users. Really no point. Also weird with Microsoft being involved they don't get the desktop app first. I get the apple deal, but still come on. 

I also don't like their presentation, pretty dead, and the background is just plain weird."
I think this was the girlfriend of all AI demos (Engelbart reference)
That comment you made about Sam not participating in this announcement and using Mira because it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúTHE BIG ONE‚Äù ‚Ä¶ screw that. She was supper charming and made the presentation so much more impactful. I‚Äôd prefer it if she did all the big announcements from OpenAI.
"The interruption, she stopped talking before he even did. So does the model have mind reading as well?"
"Well, the voice and talking is Her, but it still lack the context of You. We'll see with GPT 5..."
ethernet over usb cable is a 99% reduction in network latency(cheating)
"Oh, boy... wait, oh her. sorry. lol ;)"
Epochal
Wow that was cringe bro
"Where's HIM in that movie, which for ""biography essayist"" job need only school elementary education. Why it's even adult if kids can do same job to afford their own apartment."
