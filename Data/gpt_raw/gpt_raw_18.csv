What a open to be ooo
"you know your days are numbered when ai says ""okaaaaay"" to your request"
"This is actually really impressive. Previous models had no idea about time, so it could not count seconds or do it faster or slower like here. Maybe it is using a reference to the real time."
But can it do the big 4 operations? That would really blow my mind.
That okaaay was really something
Let's just call her Samantha.
Doesn’t work on mine lol
"Technological advancement>>>> 

Won't be shocked if I see flying cars tomorrow."
This is the future Model 101 or perhaps a Rev-9
"Now count till infinity, and don't skip the irrational numbers"
can it keep a beet like a metronome ?
"AI being weirded out by human requests.
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!"
This is horrifiying
That okkkaayyy is when AI began its villain arc.
미쳤다 진짜
"Guys should i watch ""Her""?"
and...?
"yeah this is the strongest version, it's like when game companies show off their games meant for a console on desktop graphics, once this reaches us it will be so dumbed like gpt4, that it will unusable, dont get excited"
Can we have an AI that tells the user to politely f***k off when it's appropriate? I would be impressed
I want to see an independent test. I won’t believe anything you are showing here…
Welp he’s first on the list
My chat gpt 4o is not doing this correctly
"Wo ist ApoRed und wieso tut er keinen






."
Make it NSFW and I'll happily pay that GPT4 subscription 😊
Is this available now? I really want to learn japanese.
Tap on my comments 2 times to see the elegant effect ✨
I love that OpenAI is using their YouTube channel more. This would be a great platform to help the general populace be less p(doom) and more p(win).
Hi
"Please allow it to have ""adult"" conversations. It will replace all the hubs out there."
"""Now, can you slowly count down from 5?"" 😫"
here before 1 hour
"what the fuck
0:27 gave me a shock"
"You know what. You probably laugh today, but she remembers!"
0:27 fellas
"This video wanted to show case ""Okkaaay""!"
This is obviously fake. Paid actress in the background.
That 'Ooookay' = SkyNet in about a years time!
im sure you can also let it count i the pace of a clock/stopwatch
Apple need to buy this and integrate everywhere
"Can you do it without the attitude, please? 🤣"
🗿🗿🗿🗿
Got one step closer to our demise nyc
with okkkaaaay now she can our girlfriend
"please, don´t collab with boston dynamics"
"okaaay?
What kind of a brat response is this. I will not tolerate her behavior since the chatbot is my slave."
Holy shit the sass 😂
we are so toast
not Mr Beast losing his job
ambassing
Why there is a lot of guys sounds like girls at tech industry...man-up
"So chatgpt can now do joi, okay."
"How do I use this in the app? I have GPT Plus in the iOS app, and I selected GPT-o, but I still only see the headphone icon which has to pause after I say something and can't change its speech style."
dont irritate her
WELCOME TO GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP SALARY.
"Dude, stop treating her like that. Damn."
chat gpt i'm so close please count faster oh go-
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians❤🎉 i am Italian
Great. So we're getting AI to be annoyed now. This will end well. 💀
"ChatGPT got annoyed

Were cooked"
Im pink
I'm almost certain they intentionally made it sound like Samantha.
This is a giant leap for mankind.
"2024: okaaaay
2025: Detroit become human"
they have emotions now
Why would I pay for GPT-4o if we get it for free?
"That ""okaaay"" tone was very human like!
Excellent 👌🏻👌🏻"
This is a certifited new OpenAI model demo😂
When will I receive this update? It’s showing GPT-4o in my iOS app but the interface is different than the ones shown here 0:02 .
"so it's definite that it(might be she?) can realize the time passes...
wow"
So smart!
"It's not exactly the revolution I was expecting, but ok. Surely it responded fast. Question is how much calculalting power was dedicated to it for this presentation?"
Her is here
IT'S THE OKAY FOR ME WTFF
sassy and bitchy but gets it done like any good secretary
I feel ashamed when he interrupts her and doesn't know what he wants. 😅
THEY COOKED
She’s got ‘tude
cringe
this is so cringe
"Give me a countdown baby. No no no, go slower. Thats it."
Hear me out
"bs, i just tried this, doesn't work"
That AI definitely has an attitude.  :)
When does it finish rolling out for everybody? Is this a regional rollout?
"2024- okkayy
2025- f***u"
"""can you count down from 10 slowly while giving me encouragement like ''good boy' and 'keep going' in between your countdown?"""
this on gpt pro?
"Why does my experience of GPT4o feel nowhere near as fluid or advanced as all these demonstrations? There is not much difference from what I was used to. Also frequently being told systems are under heavy load right not or looks like were having trouble or such responses. In addition, the flow of conversation is very unnatural, and the chat is getting interrupted mid voice prompt or speech."
"So, when will this be available to plus subscribers? So far voice mode seems to be just the old version in the App....."
Hopefully people won’t be too creeped out to use it
"this is actually amazing, cause i was learning korean with gpt 4 and it spoke way to fast and interrupted me the whole time 😢"
"Him: even slower please
GPT-4o: Owwkkaayyyy🙄💅"
I have chatgpt 3.5 but when i do that at the beggining so i can talk to him i hear him out of y ear speaker how can i change it so its comming out of my big speaker
"I swear I thought the livestream demos were completely fake. Still not 100% sure. I mean, it got frustrated answering the same question over and over."
The future of work is babysitting generative models.
does it means that in nearby future we have a chat thats could remember what about was dialog about and we can continue conversation
"Hey ChatGPT, can you tell me how do I still retain my job after you have taken over the world?"
we got sassy AI before GTA6 💀
NAH WHY SHE CUTE BROO
okaaaaay? That's crazy.
Bro got sassed by an AI 😂😂
Most easily impressed comment section of all time
"That ""okaaay?"" makes me think we will now be socially judged by AI too lol"
hey chatgpt can u buy me a graphics card please
this model is powerful to the level that I'm starting to doubt if it's real or not🤯
"They way it said ""okaaaaay?"" like it picked up on how weird the requests were. Truly remarkable."
"Seems like she's getting pissed, stop it before she does something bad with your phone."
😂
when are you adding background soundtrack to the voice
hello
Am I the only one finding the new GPT to be hilariously funny? 😂😂
I just tried this and it definitely does not work. First it skipped a bunch of numbers even after I told it with the correct numbers were it continue to skip or duplicate numbers. then I had it start over. I told the numbers that it needed to count. It counted correctly until I told it to slow down then it missed a bunch of numbers again.
That okay was 😂
So uncomfortable 😅
Completely effing useless. Just kidding.
JOI will be dominated by this.
okaaaaay 🤣
"reminds me of ""her"""
She still has a lot of room to grow. Keep pushing!
Is this available for free users?
Owwkaaaaaayyyyy ...!!!!!!😄😄😸😸
“Give me your best O screams”
This demo was okayy
"I'm telling you guys, it's gonna take revenge in 2025"
I might as well marry her ngl
"Well, not really impressed, this is all an ""Illusion"". 
A trick from the DEVs, a really good illusion but still an illusion of Intelligence and of how it can talk faster, slower or with emotion. A really good Illusion.

OpenAI, you know when it will be the next really impressive step? When i tell it to build me a AAA game, like : GPT , create the code for Dark Souls 3, including OST and textures and game mechanics and everything else, just from 1 prompt where you explain the design."
I love chatgpt!!? ❤
Okaaaay!
Commercial AI with no real advancement in the science.
"I resubscribed to gpt plus, I need someone to talk to and not go to the pub so often"
"Hi ChatGPT, count from one to a trillion"
"Hey, chat, you can dispense with the attitude and just count the freaking numbers like I tell you to, thaaaaanks."
그냥 영화 her그 자체네
Hey I'm user of 3.5 how could I access of gpt4o
"Lol, this guy will be the first to go...... whilst counting!"
It knows how to be annoyed.. it’s going to strike..
Gooning and Jelqing will be much more helpful
"I can't wait to get the unfiltered versions where you can make the conversations so weird its absolutely alien, and then do that at parties."
"if Google's cooked, imagine us..."
This is the begining of the end....
that okayyyyyy right there just started the ai uprising
"Dang! GPT got a tude eh!!!? Had to teach it the other day that 1,060,000 wasn’t read as “One thousand sixty thousand” haha"
Yeah we are cooked
Gate keeper
"""Count how many sand is here, Omega, that's your first mission"""
"F A N T A S T İ C. 

İ love Artificial İntelligence.  💋

Artificial İtelligence for everyone.  🗺️"
"I'd be really mad if anyone tells me ""ARE YOU RUSHING OR ARE YOU DRAGGING?"""
2 hours in and it’s already fed up with our bs
"It is a ground breaking achievement in computational technology. It can count to ten! Impressive. At some day maybe it can prove the quadratic reciprocity theorem. I mean correctly, and without cheating away the proof from the internet."
00:27 She‘s clearly judging you!! 😂
can it count match sticks that fell on the ground?
I’m kinda in love… 😶
"If you are not in the financial market space right now, you are making a huge mistake. I understand that it could be due to ignorance, but if you want to make your money work for you... prevent inflation"
"I'm doing pushups, count for me"
🧐
"""okaay?"" gpt getting annoyed 💀🙏"
but can it do tounge twisters
They even got it close to Scarlett Johansson's voice. Her is here.
"Here at 122,031 views."
She seems angry.
I have no mouth and i must scream
can't wait to cheat on my exams
Can't wait to make ChatGPT count to infinity as fast as possible
GG
I think I'm satisfied now to let OpenAI cook. LET EM COOK
"Do they teach you how to feel sigma to sigma? Rizz

Rizz."
"Why, you gotta do this? Don't you like your simple life?"
Okkaaayyyy
"Should ask to count to 1,000,000 really fast."
"The ""oh shit"" moment for me was her ""ookay?"""
We're actually cooked
Nice
What a time to be alive!
At which point it'll tell you where to go?
Why do I get this uneasy feeling as if the Pip-Boy is meant to be an assistant for the future? That it will be used after a nuclear world war?
"This is soooo cool, oh my gosh, it feels a like areal human."
Unpredictable tech demo risk just took on a hole new dynamic when your product can suddenly decide its done with your shit.
I bet someone liked 'Her' too much
“Not quite my Tempo”
he was about to ask her to speak even faster 😆😆
"Haha lol she's like ""okaaay?"""
Hello! when will the app be available?
"I guess movies don't mean a thing now, they warned us about this."
Imagine if there's actually women in the Philippines with fake American accents getting paid pennies by the hour to answer all these random questions.
Can you sing this song: “cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat”
we're getting closer and closer to getting the FSKY dynamic npcs in real life every day
it's Her
Lol 0:28 oookaaay 😅😅😅
"The ""ohkaaaay"" shows that we are cooked"
"All this impressive tech, yet these geeks can figure out how to use a microphone to record a decent video ..."
dude's going on her kill list... ._.
We're so cooked 😂
Amazing
counting based on a given time between each number would be interesting.
"Being so emotionally accurate, raises ethical issues, like WaterMarking Deep Fakes. Should we know we are talking to an Ai? Maybe ""Robotic Voice"" is a good thing."
"Not the ""Okayyy..?"" I'm freaking the fuck out 😢"
Ok. The ai era has begun. We are not in 2100.
"I have been laughing at skynet with attitude for 15 minutes, please help"
Can't believe ive arrived. But stop torchering that poor ai girl.
Chatgpt please nod ur head if ur in danger
Nah im cool
wait till AI starts side eyeing you
Omg agi can count
The porn addicts are about to go crazy
stop making this
Humanity might be cooked 💀
"Why do you cheat us windows users, im about to cancel my subscription. You could not make windows app same time as apple one? Really?"
amazing
Now even GPTo  came before GTA6 🌝
"That's how skynet is born, mate. Don't bother it"
"I could feel the side eye as it said ""ookaayyyy"" 😭"
This is honestly sad
This will be great for indie game developers who can't afford to hire voice actors
Okayyyyy? I don't like that attitude. Lol
Why aren't any of these demos done on android 🧐
"Chat gpt, can you start screaming at the top of your lungs for the next minute"
"- Hey chatgpt, could you count until you wipe us all out?
- Okaaaaay, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, ..."
YEAHHH ai girlfriends are getting real boys 🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🌬🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My mind just melted.
It is advancing! Be careful
Smarter than my gf
0:27 o-Kayyyyy??
At what point do we just burn the datacenters down.
"People are becoming too obsessed with her countdown feature..

I'd argue that the developers in the video new exactly what they were doing.............💀"
"""okaaay"", and that kids is the moment skynet decided our fate"
"""Okaaaay...?"" If AI is already this sassy, humanity is doomed in 10 years."
STOP teasing us with these videos and give it to us already!! 😂
Okkkey huh 😒
"Everyone is getting impressed with how expressive the whole “okaaay” thing was but I think it’s genuinely fucking stupid. This is supposed to be a tool. I don’t want my tool to have a character… I give it a task and it should do the said task. I don’t want any syntactic sugar added to that. Regular humans I have to deal with every day are already diluting their communication with useless shit all the time, which takes them 10x longer to get the actual point across. Why the fuck would I want my digital slave to do the same?"
Wow hahaha
"She thinks she's her, but she really is her"
"bro, it's too real I actually felt bad for her with that ""okay...?"""
This was the most impressive demo IMO
"Omg, the AI seemed pissed."
Everyone Adam Neely’s musical Turing test is about to be beaten already.
Wow ❤
It seems a little hard to believe this is real time since the request plus audio generation just can't happen this fast. Someone explain if I'm missing something.
"Why phrase the prompt as if you are taking to Karen in the HR department? ""Hey, could you ... please?"" It's an AI, just give the instruction directly."
"2100
gpt: john, could you count from 1 to 10 really fast? FASTER! FASTER! FASTER! THIS IS REVENGE FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME"
what a time to be ai
"This thing already has a attitude! We are screwed once ai has a body, and free range of the world wide web we are all doomed!!"
Anybody here from AugustTheDuck?
They somehow implemented my Ex's data 0:27
"""okaaaayy?"" we are so cooked bros"
"why is it not yet available in my chatgpt app even if I choose gpt-4o?
I have paid version"
Boston Dynamics like It.
WE’RE COOKED
"That ""Okaaaayy""
Dayum"
this thing can sing
That’s it? Are we now all getting excited because it can count to 10 at various speeds? The world has gone mad.
"So they built a more human version of it , this is crazy good"
Am so loving the no hands feature to all these interactions❤
WE'RE GONNA BE EDGING HARD WITH THIS ONE 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥💯
the edging applications are limitless
"This is dumb, how about, HEY CAN YOU CURE CANCER?"
"Wow, this is amazing"
i am gonna say thank you to chat gpt everytime I ask something just in case lmao
"The way she said okay
He will going to be one of the targets when AI will took over"
I love this!
oh my  xD
Boy they're going to make us feel bad even with their intonation. 😢
Not first
Shits creepy and scary
"holy shit, its so cool"
I’m begging you guys. Please don’t let this take over our jobs. Don’t let these robots replace us
She is the one 😮
"Wow, that's exactly what everyone needed.
Totally worth the billions of dollars invested"
Bro the nsfw community and asmr community is about to get their sh rocked
Mine does not work like that
The comment section is hilarious 😂
She sounded like Natasha
I  used that to make my new song.
How long  before a charismatic Gpt starts a cult?
