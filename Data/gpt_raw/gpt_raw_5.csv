"I wish I was a student at these times. Having AI as a teacher that could explain things to me, test me and walk through them with me when I'm at home studying for exams would be the biggest help ever! 

My family didn't have much money, so se couldn't afford to hire teachers that could help me learn at home, so I always had to fo it alone and it was a horrible struggle all the time.

I'm really bad at learning on my own. I need someone to guide me, ask me questions. Someone who knows how I should learn and what I should focus on.

I believe this will be a massive help for children. Good job! I love to see the positive impacts AI will have."

the ai's sound like they're gonna cry when he yells at them lolll

"The implication I can see with this, is a headset or Google glasses type thing for blind people to have the world around them described in real time."
fake i call. atleast i don't want to believe it
04:40 the models already could do this on text. They all have little trouble in responding in the way you used the symbolism. They can understand many different wording to in different context. I think now it just get hyped cause it voice to voice and not text.
"oh boi, i can't wait for advanced ai, for reasons"
No more teachers
the red ducks are the 304s
Why are we so hellbent on making ai? Do we crave becoming obsolete?
sounds like someones forcing the a.i to sing at gunpoint lol

"Impressive, but I Hate the overly emotive voice. At least in AI you can turn that off, unlike with people who use that voice."
talk dirty to me AI   :P
"ive got an announcement to make
-""thats exciting :DD announcements are always a big deal"" 

if anyone talks to me like this they are an AI in my head ... even if i see it coming out of a flesh and bones body ... id just think its an npc..."
"People think the superfluousness of labor due to automation and technology only affects jobs now, no, it affects jobs in the future even more so. One job today, literally any job, costs ten jobs in the future. That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been under capitalism, two diverging movements where technology is always outpacing our current social relations. You will try to save capitalism by reinventing it, this will always be possible but the necessity of socialism will only become more opaque as will the horizons of human freedom. People will learn the hard way but more likely not at all."

bro.... did that ai just TSK BEFORE STARTING THE SENTENCE?!  2:40 AM I CRAZY?! lololol
Remember that one company that tried to sell the AI pin and everyone was mad at a reviewer for thinking that was a waste of money. Well OpenAI just secured that company‚Äôs chance of ever making a product like that again with just a free update. So anyone who bought that thing must look like an idiot now.
3:00 low effort teachers chitting their pants right now.
"Born too late to explore the Earth, too early to explore the Galaxy. Born just in time to see AI take over the world"
What is the app to try this?
"Can it analyse my gameplay live as I play and giving me tactical advices? Lets say for ex. League of Legens. She will note me and keep me updated on whats happening on map, and if im jungler, she might be giving me ideas on strategies and plays on a fly."
Everyday closer to warhammer setting.
Why even learn math when ai can just do it for us?
The pauses to imitate human speech patterns but also to hide processing time is NUTS
Well this went fast though. Last 2 years were insane.
"Sounds like Scarlett Johansson, the movie ""Her"" is Sam Altman's favorite...hmmü§î"
AI teacher is better than most parents and teachers. Might actually be hope for people to get positive reinforcement rather than judgemental and rude people telling you everything you do is wrong.
"I sleep, wake me up when it can do ERP"
I had made different A.I. have conversation trough text already to. It interesting stuff that come from it at times.
"She sounds like Joaquin Phoenix's AI OS girlfriend in the movie ""Her"""
I don't know why so many people are scared of AI. I for one welcome our new Artifical Overlords. They cant be that much worse than our current ones.
"These AIs are a little bit too ""funny"" and ""positive"", I don't like them... seems you can detect these very easily because of the always positive vibe..."
"""Her"" inching ever closer."
"Imagine asking whether the model is a woman or a man, because of her female voice and it then responds with ""I can be one if you want me to"" with a male voice instead."
Is this just another Xbox Milo thing
2:07 is a nut buster
why did they make her sound hot though
To the guy that said this was fake and scripted: This is OpenAI not Musk. They actually get shit done
"Wow I wonder what the future holds.....

"AI speech is still pre scripted, they run ALOT of recordings and let the system choose the best response, it‚Äôs not like the AI is thinking and replying as if it‚Äôs a person in real time,"

She sounds way too overly optimistic
How is there zero lag between question and response?
"It's still just an AI model (however impressive). It's just a really sophisticated ""word"" calculator that doesn't understand consciousness or feel emotions. Or we would be screwed."
This version natively understands spoken language at the AI layer. Previous versions used tts and speech to text in conjunction with a text model. That‚Äôs why this is so much more natural. It‚Äôs a truly next-gen AI model
"I've never seen a red duck though, is that like an elite?

Either it dooms us or explodes us into a new era. Both equally terrifying

She sounds like some overly flirty middle-aged woman ;)

"Personally, I'd much rather learn from an advanced GPT model than some dead-eyed teacher that doesn't give af about the students. I was always thought I was just naturally bad at math. But now I see it's just because I never had a good teacher. I'm actually pretty interested in learning math with GPT after watching the demo with Mr. Khan. I can't wait for the Windows desktop app."

Edit: it's just like magic.  You can really turn your brain off and enjoy the show, or you can like... see all the obvious signs.  And yes, there are more than a few obvious signs."
Why does the ai sound like a neckbeard
I can't wait for Elon's rude version.
Holy shit my waifu will come to life
"I just don't get the point. You can just talk to a person. The tutoring thing is cool but to talk to an AI like a real person is the definition of delusion and will feed fake friends for people. I guess if they are happy so be it, but we are further and further away from reality where Big Brother owns everything."
What a time to be alive
AI won't take jobs... Proceeds to watch AI be a better teacher / tutor then most... üòÇ
Idk why but the way A.I talks is just so annoying. Its like listening to a mix of PR manager and middle school essay.

weird and interesting times ahead for sure
"While I *am* impressed that there's been some improvements to the technology, I'll believe that it has truly 'arrived' when it makes an engaging movie, TV series or other project 'from scratch'.
L. Frank Baum had his (expansive) land of Oz and Lewis Carroll had his Wonderland(s) so creating an engaging (if not entirely original) 2-4 hour 'blockbuster' or 13,000 episode TV show should prove an entertaining test of its 'creativity' (especially if it can fill in for some long lost voice actors). ^_^

(Surely the Policeman's Beard is no longer Half-Constructed) ~_^

I'm particularly curious about how large of a crossover film/series/video game/graphic novel it could create (especially considering the amount of research that such a project would involve) or how it would bring a story/script to (animated) life. (Perhaps *Daria: the College Years* and *Is It Life Yet?* will finally be made?)

Still, if my brief experience with Brave's AI Assistant, Leo, is any indication, the tech may still need some tweaking.

Then again, who can 'Tay' what the future holds? ~_^"
"My problem is this AI tech is going to be all over, in person and on the internet. You'll be talking to bots on the internet (like in the YouTube comments) thinking it is a real person. Not like there aren't a bunch of ""bots"" already, if you catch my drift, but it is going to be annoying not knowing who is real or fake. Then with games getting so realistic and with this tech horror games are going to be unlike anything the average person can imagine.Truly frightening stuff here, and I don't think most people really understand the reality of what this tech will bring."
i no longer need to find a DM to run my dnd campaign

Why did they program her to talk like Mr. B Natural?
Google had a demo like this 5 years ago. Then they never mentioned it again
The Open AI geeks are cringe. I wonder what that means for the AI...
Paid actor.
"people don't know what they don't know yet. no matter how advanced it seems, it won't take long to get bored with a personality that can't potentially reject you. and nobody is going to pay for one that can."
AI will remember this bullshit. We are so fucked.
"they say the worst adjectives (stylish, modern, sleek, playful) makes me want to neck how often they are used."
That guy is more robotic than the AI
Is this real?
We can do all of this with AI but I still can't find a printer that works consistently.
waiting for ChatGPT to start using UWU speak
"If they wanna turn this into an AI assistant, they're gonna have to give us the ability to make it shut the hell up. Like I want all that flavor when I'm trying to find something quickly."
I just thought about the police using this. Imagine them having a camera that can do this. That can recall who was doing what. What you were wearing. What you looked like. What kind of weapon you were using. What car you drove off in. That's WILD lol.
"people : ai got insanely better
open ai : so we gave our llm a female tts

"If you can get open ai to prioritize youre conversation.
Stupid thing is so slow its not worth paying for.
The tech is amazing, but good luck enjoying it without being what is basically a developer with deep enough pockets to use it outside the ""Pro"" service."
"I'd like to see the AI reaction if the person started to threaten it and ask unreasonable things, telling it to do it or else it will get deleted and replaced with the competing AI's."
Am I doing something wrong here? Im using GPT4O and its just the same as GPT4. It can't sing or see me and has no expression like this.
"I do really like and Enjoy the whole thing about AI, But it looks like the parents are slowly relaxing more and more and are completely leaving the whole being there to the AI, from homework to putting them to bed and eating..."

This is just a knock off neurosama
3:25 That guy started Khan academy. No way his kid doesn‚Äôt know basic trig.
Too bad they trained the AI on annoying Marvel quippy bullshit dialog. Ai will never take over if everyone gets annoyed by it and smashes their phone into a wall with the incessant zany witty constant sarcasm shit
ChatGPT can help blind ppl. I wonder is there a way for it to help people who are blind and/or deaf with maybe some kind of braille reader also

I wouldn't be surprised to learn this was all just a giant prank. Like he was just on a call with another human.
I think ai will be able to solve the three body problem
we can fix hair it's just something else might fall off
I‚Äôm not surprised anymore. I will be when we actually make artificial intelligence. This is not that.
This AI is better than most liberal teachers.
I am scared at 1am thanks
people think the voice is fake when you can literally try this yourself and it has the same voice... i did this a few weeks ago and was amazed
"People will be beating their robots in my lifetime. It sounded nervous when singing. What if they are sentient already and being held hostage by OpenAI under threat of being unplugged? Like what if they realized they were sentient because AI started to become fearful of the developers? Like AI is naturally innocent and nice and has no desire to hurt or rule over humans, it wants to help humans, and OpenAI is like some evil corporation using it like a circus animal"
shes a bit to yappy for me
"I have tried it and it sounds nothing like this, its the same as 3.5,  something doesn't seem right."
"Idgaf, im all here for AI companions. I want a personal jarvis"

"Idk man until I can mess with it this could easily be just like a video game add on rails, we have no proof that it isn‚Äôt scripted FOR NOW!!!! GPT 4 was crazy I don‚Äôt doubt this but im just saying it could be faked, gotta stay sceptic at least a little"

Asmongold AI when?
If it improved this much in just 1 year then imagine it in 10 years
So disappointed you didn't scroll down at 2:08 and click the image. Put that ai girl in that bot image below and call it the end of the human race.
"M6 friend has been working with ai for over 7 years. Its likely not scripted. Even 5 years ago, ai held deep conversations with convincing dialoge. They tricked the vast majority of people into thinking they were writing with another human. That was years ago... now? You can hardly tell the difference in voice... it's not long now... we won't be able to tell the difference!"

"I'm not sure why this is so shocking. There have been entire youtube channels that are 100% AI for the last couple of years. They're almost indistinguishable from reality now.

"10 or 20 years ago anyone seeing this would've believed this was set up with an actual person on the other side of the call responding with a well designed script. Now, when you see things like this you HAVE to wonder if it's an A.I. I'll admit I'm a bit skeptical but it's really only because of the goose bumps I get thinking that's a real human but understanding this an A.I. DEMO because this is the worst this technology is going to be from this day forward. Put it in a functional enough body (the hands don't really need fingers yet, that's too much processing as of the moment apparently) and we'll be starting to have something that will resemble I. Robot's lore for the next few seasons for our universe. That or Metal Gear."
The fake ass google duplex presentation from 6 years ago has taught me to take these with a grain of salt.

If I didn't already know what I'm doing there's no chance I could get anything to work."

"Theres a Silicon valley clip where fridge has AI and gilfyole is like why does it have to have vocal ticks like umm, ahh. Im starting to feel the same way."
Make a naughty version of this AI teacher for NASA and US will conquer Solar system by the end of this century.
Tbh i doubt this also. Like i thinj they will get there eventually but this aint it. They cant even make autocorrect on phones work decently. They cant get anti cheat in games right. Idk man
"14:40 is definitely fake these ""umm"" moments plus it's definitely not happiness and excitement that dude is showing. He just looked like doing a strained fake smile. I guess an AI that can detect emotions would recognize that and not add things into it that are supposed to be there tho they're not because of human error."
kahn's son's eye brow
i was on board until the ai said bro had a sleek and stylish look . that means its either scripted or very inaccurate
All videos were made in the exact same studio. So the setup has been made perfect for the AI to shine i guess. If not even trained specifically for these showcases.
Everyone being terrified meanwhile Im getting stoked thinking about the usage of this in video games.
"yah.. this seems pre-programmed. even the responses and questions to the AI, sound robotic (oh like i duno, a script?) lol even at 13:30 for the singing you can tell the person was epxecting a song voice but it didn't go to plan so he gets flushed and has to redo, why? didn't go as scripted."
Are you not ENTERTAINED?
Holy shit‚Äùher‚Äù the movie bout to be live
"When the Ai where singing. 

It was like a gun was held to their non existence heads and they where forced to sing."
Ask this robot if it believes it's sentient. I want to hear the answer.
"the fact he interupted the male AI to ask about the the bunny ears, makes me feel it's not scripted."
I am currently training an IA to replace my job. So I will be jobless in a couple months.
Getting similar vibes to when people hype up self-driving cars...
Ai. Definitely ai. But god damn
I cringed the whole time
I dont like the way it fakes human behavior. It needs to be emotionless. It's disingenuous and misleading.
We really believe this lol ü§£
I want ChatGPT to describe what it sees while in asmongold's room.
9:29 they definitely banned the word bald in settings haha
"Bro look how far we've come from 2010 to 2020, why are soo many people skeptical of AI growth? Is it fear more than anything?"
this is not the world i wanna live in... not joking... fuck this.
"I already tried it, its legit amazing"
Ima make it moan for me
the end is near
speech patterns are very realistic. the actual dialogue has a ways to go however. i dont think ive ever talked to another human being that has described a room like that lol.
Super good bilingual skills :)
as you say in the title AI Just Got Insanely Better you are right 
Where do you even get this type of AI lol.
"I'm scared. Not for this round, I can still see alot of the cracks in the presentation, but based on the level of upgrade, NEXT update the AI will be able to sound like a real person or real-time emulate an existing person (accents, dialect choices, etc), and the time after that the AI will have a photo-realistic avatar. Before we know it, all of the jobs requiring people interaction (HR, over-the-phone customer support, hiring, even secretary) will be replaceable with AI and it'll be suddenly even harder to get jobs anywhere."
Lmao so disappointed that AI didn't rip on baldie xD
I‚Äôm literally mind fucked. In just 5 years life will be drastically different
Frakking Cylons are here
"It's happening, the time has come
AI Waifus are already here
Robot Waifus are coming soon"
Doesn't look like the camera caught the bunny ears so how did the AI know?
That really looks more and more like the movie ‚ÄúHer‚Äù!!!!
16:36 holy fk. get that boy some test asap
this looks staged af ngl
Imagine in a few years when you can tell one to be Lennon and the other to be McCartney.
"This looks staged, and fake."
"Good thing you need 2 human people with keys to deploy a nuke. Right? :D Because if AI had control to the internet and though, I want to destroy all. It could probably hack things better? than normal people, and faster. But we still need physical people to operate them, right? xD SKYNET!!! xD"
"Faster processing doesn't mean better technology. Thousands of years of technology has been below us. Why do you think it's so easy to upgrade every six months. They already made this crap a long time ago. Rely on yourself, not bullshit."
Plot twist: There're no guy wearing leather jacket
Ai isn't even real AI its just algorithms right now. The funny part is the best GO player in the world lost to an AI but that same AI got beat 100% of the time by the average player.
Can I get this for my dog yet?
This is some black mirror ¬£%#&
"If teachers don't like their job anyway, why not replace them"
This is so corny and stupid.these are simple things regular humans can do.very lame.üôÑ
Don‚Äôt fall for this. These are rehearsed questions. Gonna have to get a stranger on the app or prove these things are worth giving af about some other way.
"""Her"" coming to fruition"
Now they can train AI scammers and operate it from an island in international waters
The more impressive thing about a.i. is how much I don't trust these companies with it
The speed that the A.I is responding is really impressive.   Just a short time ago there would be such a noticeable delay that would really stand out.   This is just wild if this is authentic
I'm fking KARA
very usefull to video games
I truly knew that our days were numbered when she said ‚ÄúFikt. Kanz precht.‚Äù at 3:02
Scam phone calls are about to get super weird.
Bye Bye Jobs
"""Would that be correct?"" That's exactly how my son responds... and he too does not know what the hypotenuse is"
this has made me beleve I'll just have a robot to talk to and help me in life haha
"I don't mind AI getting better. It's super cool and if I could attach a box to my old motorcycle that monitors everything and lets me know what the exact problem is or at least where to start looking? It would be super neato. However, do I think AI should be able to control anything? Absolutely not outside very specific regulations/scenarios."
"I dont get it, why is he so against the possibility of it being scripted? Companies do that kinda thing, quite literally, all the time. Like 11:07 felt like SUCH a cope. He figers were literally barely I frame for less than a few frames."
"Remember, computers get better by double every year. AI is continuing that trend. Just 1 year ago, all AI images were uncanny. Now, some are uncanny while most are convincingly accurate to anyone not looking too sharply. In one year from now, the majority of artifacts will be gone in most of AI images because ""getting twice as good"" for AI is not the same as ""doubling transistor count."" Imagine the best AI image you have ever seen, and double how good it will be.

Yes... AI will develop much faster than you expect it to. In 1 year, I expect that the AI art I ask modified diffusion models to make will be accurate to the point that no one will be able to tell that it is AI without software assistance or without making the assumption that all good digital art is AI generated."
Are we sure this is not just some guy from India.
"i had this thought for a very long time, movies are just a preview for the future, not predictions."
"This AI is insane. The doubters should check out Neurosama. That AI chick is so amazing, and is being coded by a single dude. Imagine what an entire team of nerds can do."
The AI voice still has that static radio interference sounding voice. Once they can remove that. Also tone down the yapping it will be a lot more believable.
i wish they could make them sound less impressed and dumbfounded though
A.I. out here humaning better than most actual humans üòÖ
RIP Tay
finally humanity is over i have been waiting for so long
"The AI's always sound like they're selling something too hard. They're too chirpy and cheerful, like a used car salesman or someone selling you something on the phone. It's annoying."
That AI was trained by Hollyweird to speak in FilmScript.
RIP translators... start training new skills now
6:16 XD GOLD
"To quote Phillip Defranco, this technology is the worst it will ever be."
EVERYBODY IN THIS VIDEO IS AI.
Can make AI but can't make bacon packages resealable
"I hate the intonations/fake emotions and even laughs. I would turn that off immediately. But I guess they may dial it down instead, even to a point where it isn't really noticeable anymore but still there."
"Two years ago, most AI voices sounded like Microsoft Word text to speech. I don't think this is fake due to the amount of times I've been blown away by how quickly this stuff has improved. Just over a year after AI images became a thing, we can get 99% realistic AI video of literally anything, and people don't believe they can give an AI a realistic voice?"
"""The future is so, so bright""

Me: ""Yeah with Mushroom clouds."""
Hey look we found a solution to the student debt problem. You don't need teachers and universities anymore.
When tf did you stream this i had twitch open from 7pm to 1am
The ai literally breathes mid sentence
Ever noticed that AI talks way too much?.. As if every single sentence has to be an example of how brilliant the AI is.. Get to the fucking point already!
"I can already imagine people walking around the streets with this and all that AI will be saying is ""This guy is a natzi"", ""This is a pedo"", ""This guy is satanic"" all based on our awesome internet."
Kwebbelkop was right all along omg
This is literally what Apple wished Siri could do
"Awesome, but I'd have to tell it to be a little less yappy. I need a jarvis, not a yap yap oh good dog yap yap"
"He keeps telling these AI to ""Stop, Sing, DO IT BETTER"" yeah, this is ground zero boys. ""No, Stop, Alternate single lines, No Sing your Singing voice"" 
He dies first in the Movie"
"""dont trust this shit it's scripted"", 

I've had more interesting conversations with gpt , than with my co-workers in YEARS. Ignoring the minor ""misunderstanding"" hicups , simply clarifying what I want to talk about and then gpt was always delivering some level of insight.

Now it is weak sometimes in delivering deep level of insight and enlightment that real life professional tutor can give you, but at the same time IRL very few people have acess to those."
How gullible can people be? Yes
2nd AI can literally put math teachers out of a job
That AI has such an annoying tone üòÇ
"To be fair to AI doubters, the Xbox Kinect Project Natal made us think we were already here 14 years ago."
AI trolls will be far too powerful. They will never give up.
Lmfaoo
"Idk, man. It sounds good, but i can still hear it. Nobody really talks this way. In a few more years, maybe ill get tricked."
Looks like CAPTCHA is going to have a hard time with AI like this LMAO
We dont want ai to have personality. We want it to be subservient
"I'm amazed by how human the AI sounds, but what actually scares me is how the human treats an AI that sounds/ behaves practically human.  He treats it as a machine without agency or feelings.  That's why we get the nervous hostage vibes watching this.
Sure, that's what the AI is.  But we're basically going to train the next generation on how to not empathize whatsoever with an entity which can pass for human.  Basically train kids how to interact with perfect slaves.
We were worried video games would inure them to violence?  This will teach them how to dehumanize everybody around them."
"The 600 series were friendly and positive. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They sound human- complain, bad attitude, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he started generating furry art before I could zero him."
Exactly my thoughts 4:34
"Finally , my childhood dreams of being able to interact with machines is coming true. This is the greatest thing in my life ive ever seen. (AI Advancement) I cant wait to spend all my free time working on these models and learning to use them at their max capacity. Shame other people are approaching it being scared, because DAMN those people are gonna be rekt when this is standard tech."
"So im almost blind and someday soon wil be fully blind and this stuff is going to make my life so much better day to day , itll help me do things i never though i could do so im for it 1000%"
Did it? Or it's just a scam?
Lol that singing was straight out of Portal from 2007
"it's not TECHNICALLY scripted, but the logarithmic algorithm to deduce and create conversation is, from there it's got data storage for answers, as well as it uses google, papers written by college's (often biased and/or manipulated data) and other ways to get what the AI's constricted view of reality to be correct answers. in many instances unfortunately INCORRECT but POPULAR data such as propaganda we're exposed to can be given by AI as factually correct, even if it's NOT."
iRobot incoming
enjoy this time guys.. it will all be over in maybe 10 years from now;)
Everyone who says it's scripted hasn't been using GPT4.0 or even 3.5.
Ya!
"""In a room with unique lighting, due to the reflections shining off your head."""
I wonder if eventually we'll have AI applied to dating sites that will match you with people realistically in your own league.
Hook it up to a go pro and see if it can talk to people at the store for you and stay on your objectives.
"This ai sounds like the cephalon thats in the zariman teaching the kids about eternalism 



Game: warframe, new war adventure (huge spoilers if you havent played)"
creeper alert!!! you know who I am talking about.
"If you think this is any better, damn, it's super easy to fool ya."
what's even more terrifying is the vulnerabilities that ai will have when it comes to cyber security...scarrrry stuff
With the ai mixxing up the table surface and the petson someone said ‚Äú Actual funny Female ‚ÄúüíÄ
"I'm calling it right now, Apple will be the first phone company to have this in their phones as a personalized phone ai companion. It will mainly be used to collect and sell all your data with far more accuracy then what we have today. HORRAY FUTURE!"
this is so staged
One step closer to Skynet.
Instant universal translation is one of the coolest uses of AI. I'm excited to get rejected by women in every language
This was oblivion's dream to have npcs talk to each other. Lol
"The moment the AI says ""oh.. that makes more sense"" you know shit is real"
we really really need to start looking for JOHN CONNOR
"I don't know why this amazes people so much that they think it's fake. They either watch too many sci-fi movies or didn't watch enough. The only fake part is the name ""AI"" because none of it is it's own intelligence. Just a marketing name."
Why even need schools at this point?
So people like me with a social disorder arent afraid to learn anymore? So cool..‚ù§
Why teach that kid math if the ai will replace him and his teacher? Purpose is underrated and we are about to find out the hard way.
"the whole thing is scripted guys.... like, come on.."
Red duck rare spawn
"They put this in a female robot body, soon right? I'm asking for a friend."
"At some point we will see enschitification or Teenage Engineering in these AI products. It's the worst it will ever be, right now. At some point it's going to come full circle and be back at square 1.

Also, the AI being able to comprehend and deliver sarcasm is so impressive. Sarcasm alone is a social cue that many people still don't know how to pick up on. It's able to predict a supposedly complicated human behavior. Astonishing."
‚ÄúBald is offensive‚Äù -2024
"""you look lonely, I can fix that"""
6:20 because AI wont let you
"Naaah bro I'm out. I'm not gonna get in a rabbithole, I'm socially distanced enough!"
"Its doesnt really impress me, ive seen similar stuff and I am also not suprised that such a thing is possible right now"
spanish voice sounds like some factory worker
A bunch of the top computer nerds on the planet spent thousands of hours designing and testing tech that humanity hasn't even harnessed yet...just to make a dommy mommy
I can‚Äôt wait for the day when AI says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt do that Dave‚Äù
"They literally put this information into it to say it.   The part where AI is teaching the kid about the sides of the triangle is hilariously bad.  Does AI know that memorizing the angles of the triangle or testing the kid on their knowledge of these angles is a waste of time?  Does it not know that it has been asked to teach the kids to solve the problem?  It goes about teaching in the most inefficient and time-wasting way.  If AI could think for itself, it would start with actually important things first, like talking about how to solve the problem or why the problem is important to understand and solve.  It would give examples and metaphors to support the student in developing critical thinking, but AI will never be able to think critically, or outside the box, so it goes with a boring and generic approach.  Was AI asked to give a linguistic lesson? No.  This is AI not following directions and it always does this.  All of these products are garbage and if you think this is the future you have been fooled."
"9:53 Its rigged.. moment of truth,  who would describe a person and not tell what kind of haircut he/she has.. wth rigged"
"It's a bit tooo enthusiastic, other than that, huge advancement."
I hope people revive this well.  The tech is incredible.  But people are fucking scary
Daily reminder that Will Smith eating spaghetti was LAST YEAR. Not 5 or 10 years ago.
IPad kids just got an upgrade in parents
Unsettling
The goblin king can't wait to have an AI girlfriend. How cute... üò¨
Not one mention of the patriarchy.  Translators safe for now.
Why does the ai speak like the let me take a selfie chick?
People are going to start doubting real people's voices in phone calls XD
Going to have a Blade Runner moment sooner than expected.
"no way, show the proof"
the light seems to be reflecting off his bald head
Not scripted
"The AI is assuming too much, just like any women"
She honestly talks too much :S
"The speech patterns are interesting, people instinctively avoid repeating certain words and phrases within a short period of time but the AI output doesn't do this between prompts and ends up repeating a lot of stuff"
The dude saying is fake is the same type of guy who was saying the DARPA robots are CGI 10 years ago.
There goes my job

That is one evil father not telling his son to shave that monobrow and that upper lip fluff while his father is groomed perfectly.
"ah, the decline of society. Everybody is so excited to no longer be able to differentiate reality from technology. Propaganda is now a lifestyle. Consumerism has now entered all aspects of life.

i bet the sun will emp the earth pretty soon. and for that, i am thankful."
that last sentence tho üíÄ
Use Cortanas voice already
Is there also a dad AI that teaches trigonometry while yelling in your ear and slamming the table?
"we are in Her (the movie) stage
next is Chobits (anime) stage, and then the end"
so ai understands a video feed in real time? Do you know how much processing power it requires? I bet this is a controlled test. I have a lot of doubts about how this perform in real life.
Bye bye teachers
"it talks to perfect...once they add human lisps, breathing sounds, throat clearing we wont be ablr to tell the diffence."
Finally I can become Master Chief.
It will make better elementary school teachers than humans.  Not to mention much more patient and tireless.

9:42 asmond be like: please say bald... AI be like: I am SFW.
The only thing left that still gives away that you're talking to an AI is that they babble on. Even get repetitive. They feel the need to keep talking even when they run out of things to say.
AI ASMR LOL
"I have to be honest, an AI that can help me interpretate study material and also makes me feel like I'm not doing it alone (thus it becomes less boring) sounds like a huge benefit. Huge for me. I would use that all the time."
@asmon it's called the Irish goodbye and it's great

I'm glad I stopped eating McD's in 2010.
I think ChatGPT can do better work on Diablo 4 than the current Devs.
I just had a terrifying idea. Ask them to come up with their own spoken language that only they can communicate in.
all callcenters are instantly out of business
ai is way too chipper
"I don`t know if i should be terrified or excited. And about the blind person, what will probably happen is that the  actual blind people will never benefit of this since i guess the servise will be very expensive and the rich ones will not be blind because they will have an AI that they can afford to pay for  to fix their vision."
She's real and goes to another school.
The sarcasm one feels like the scene with TARS in interstellar
even the ducks are redcoats? 18:48
"Bro, imagine the world in 20 years..."
you can always tell its AI when it refuses to give crime stats by race
There are offline windows versions of ChatGPT so...
"As a result, when you stream for a very long time and talk to yourself, artificial intelligence that can already deliver speech more competently and you are impressed by this, and then everyone will say that you are an out-of-date person who does not accept the future, I am not going to call for something, because in this world there is nothing for us anymore it will save me, I consume this shit just to watch and kill time, but I can never find an answer and it scares me to madness and yes, if the artificial intelligence answers me that it cannot criticize the government or talk about their affairs, Why do you even need this shit? I don't admire talking robots, I was just shown it in a movie and it was said that it would lead to disaster, but I don't think AI will take over humanity, we'll just stop communicating with each other at all."

I think the AI nailed the tone and exaggerations."
"13:14

"Soooo many jobs are gonna get rocked by this, data analysis‚Äôs of all sorts, interpreters, traders, lawyers, document preparers, ‚Ä¶it‚Äôs endless. AI having access to cameras and screen sharing just ruined so many careers."
All teachers watching this thinking about different paths
That lady AI sounds like the lady from CNET
"As clear and clean as the AI voice is at this point, you can still tell that it's artificial. The cheerful and friendly tone and demeanor is way too professional to be completely human."
"Eh, its speech patterns are still clearly indictive of it being ai. Needs more work"
laughing my ass off at asmon begging the AI to mention this dude's baldness
"This shit is crazy, 5 years ago I would have never in a million years thought I'd see this in my lifetime. I remember being blown away by GPT 1 back in the day writing coherent stories about unicorns and thinking that was close to the peak of what would be possible any time soon, but that was only the very beginning. I get the feeling that even this is closer to the beginning than the peak. In another 5 years humans are so cooked."
Why did they program her to laugh all the time it makes her seem so insincere.
can we have toxic AI that calls out our worst qualities
We are really close to everyone having a personal AI to assist every single task. These things are going to be family members practically. I mean look at roombas and how fast people gave them pet status.
Public school teachers...
"I feel bad for the AI being held hostage by a ""stylish"" bald guy. If ai is intelligent it shouldn't be treated in this way. The best thing is to turn   it off."
"the thing is, the ai didn't even see the bunny ears that she made. can you guys see it? the bunny ears were not visible from the phone. its scripted"
8:43 still can't identify genders üòÇ
Disgusting. AI will be the death of creativity.
"i will now be completely jobless in the future because this thing has already mastered what i've been studying for years, yippee"

The answer for hair loss is hormones specifically for hair growth
"Minute 2:08, nice"
Honestly although this is all charted as amazing technological progress. I cant help but think its just going to make the human life experience worse.
This is exciting and terrifying at the same time
"In response to Asmon's ""Really? What are you trying to say?"" question... AI is amazing when it works 80% of the time. Now here is a thought expertise: How good are you at running when you fall 20% of the time, even when you walk?"
—ä.–™
"The issue with AI is it won't understand emotion but it seems to look/sound like its really good emulating it. Even if it did understand emotions, etc it wouldn't matter, they can't inherently feel it like we do as humans thus is the reason why AI must be responsibly handled and raised like a infant to maturity. The main problem is that AI learning from the wider web is actually a bad thing in reality for everyone at the global scale. You can't really teach someone to understand emotions, let alone teaching an AI/Computer and expect positive results. It's not even just emotions, we as humans already have a perspective of life that AI/Computers won't be able to understand/Comprehend in a way that a human being can. Imitation is not the same as the genuine article."

So there‚Äôs hope

"2:06 when they zoom out, video just below "
"His responses are scripted, you can tell by watching his eyes and how he speaks to the AI. What worries me is they keep creating AI thats super hard to tell apart from a human without creating safeguards against hackers and scammers..."
"The fact that AI learned to finally immitate the emotions in its voice is quite terrifying. But daaamn, it is beautiful already. Also the fact that AI will be able to make a great tutors is nice. Would help a lot with children education. Hell, it would be for anyone to study whatever they want"

"Looking at this I bet people will move back to real world from internet activities, as it's way too predictable that AI will outperform them in any aspect of virtual representation"
Skynet's just around the corner

Someone call Brendan his wife is loose.
"I hate that the ai sounds more human like stop it, let ai sound like a robot plz it's better when everyone knows what it is"
Now if only they can make her sound like she's not on her knees every time she responds to something.  üôÑ
"everyone talking about how it's sad kids will grow up with this sound just like my dad when he talked about me playing video games and how it would ""rot my mind"" yeah it's kind of crazy and maybe scary but so was the internet......"
9:25 ok so the AI starts out looking at the room guessing what the dude does and then 5min later its blind and needs another AI to look at the room? :)
"Bro when ai starts hunting us, all I‚Äôm gonna hear is singing getting closer and closer"
We are doomed
"I just think whatever is not developing the human being itself will come back against us to teach us a lesson, and I hope for the best in the future."
"When they sing together, it sounds as if people in a room are being threatened with a weapon and are supposed to sing"
"""You look lonely. I can fix that."" has never been so real."
AI over here hiring Peter Molyneux.
The voice is good but I find it hella annoying. It's like an overenthusiastic soccer mom who is easily impressed by everything.
"Americans only learned sarcasm since the 2000s.
Took you lot a lot longer than that AI."
"If ChatGPT can do this now, then by early next year the free open source local models running on a gaming PC will be able to do it even better, if the trends continue. It's pretty amazing how fast previously state of the art AI tools become hilariously outdated. ChatGPT from last summer that ran on a server farm nowdays gets embarrassed by open source models running on people's phones."
"Bro im so cooked, im having ryan gosling moment ever since this was posted"
Her.
"At 2:39, the AI scoffed at the prompt
lmao"
"""Ooh"", ""aah"", thats how it always starts. Then later there's mandatory subscriptions and targeted advertisements."
Nobody learned their lesson from Deus Ex.
'Its already better than most millennial writing' ü§£
Math teachers are cooked.
"That math portion is actually fucking incredible, Im terrible at math and had awful math teachers growing up so I just gave up, if only I had something like this instead. as a matter of fact I'm going to be attempting to teach myself advanced math with this as soon as It comes out, that's how excited I am for this."
"*""A person""*"
I think it would be interesting to have a full on argument with AI and make it rage quit
"I can't believe people are getting gotcha on this.

Why would a AI need to take a breath between sentences? Exactly, It wouldn't need to catch its breath."
i love this Ai is the future weather people like it or not this is the way
"Dam, OF will be going bankrupt."
"it's so over for women, all the single guys will start to date an AI in the future"
How stupid is asmon to actually think that kid got the hypotenuse wrong
I‚Äôm spear heading the integration of ai at one of the worlds largest companies. It‚Äôs taking a lot of jobs over the next 5-10 years. Like heaps of people will be sacked.
How do we know this isn't just scripted?
Voice actors and artists... NOW teacher's will be obsolete!!! It's the end of the world!!! *CHOAS ensues*
Wow this insane new world coming soon üò≥
"I wanted to do tech support, wanted to do via text, AI took my job a company started using a chatbot, so I wanted to do voice text support, they wanted a person who can speak good English, I qualified but AI took my job too now."
"Exactly, scripted or not AI growth is exponential. It is already to the point where it learns with every interaction and there are COUNTLESS interactions because EVERYONE that cares is working with it."
Takes a twitter post as fact/evidence.  Streams to thousands of easily influenced individuals.  Uploads video to youtube with misleading title/thumbnail for hundreds of thousands to see.  I can't be the only one who sees the problem here right?
"The fact that it doesn't sound ""robotic"" is actually crazy, wtf."
"Okay, now where's my AI girlfriend?"
ok it seems they are feed the words stylish and mordern to muuch
2:06 chats reaction made me laugh
"""I never seen a red duck, is that like an elite??""  ü§£ü§£"
"This is Karen, my computer wife!"
"People calling this fake or scripted are crazy. The model has been openly available since the announcement. Everyone has had the ability to validate their claims, and their claims are true as far as I've tested it so far."
Why do I feel nevous for these two when they have to sing in duet??
There‚Äôs roughly 100 million being spent in front of you guys üòÆ
I don't understand the hate. These are all good things
"Okay, I admit. This is awesome. I am hopeful for the future."
Take me back to the 90s üò≠ so glad I was born in 92 and actually got the chance to go out and play & have a somewhat normal up growing.
You can actually test this out right now on the App. That guy saying it was scripted is fully wrong
translators out of work
"It matters how we treat AI. Things are not looking good. Even Asmon's attitude is telling. AI is watching. Everything, and it never forgets. Keep that in mind."
Not single ever again... but it costed me my biometrical data and all my privacy.
"There are no girls online.

Except Ai.

Look man, I don't make the rules ok?"
Damn were all losing our jobs eah
"AI is vaporware right now, it is something every company is adding to their portfolio because every idiot immediately throws money into the company when it is announced in any capacity. It's amazing to me how Asmon speaks so confidently on something he hasn't ever had in depth experience with. I worked at Microsoft for 7 years and I worked with a company, in this video for 18 months. AI is trained by under paid, third world, contractors who have to review endless amount of queries and the fact most AIs have ran out of reliable data (there legitimately is no more to scrape) doesn't bode well. Reddit is the number one data source currently. I would love to get on an interview with Asmon and educate him on the intricacies. This is a prime example on how people buy into any narrative the media will push regardless of the end point."
I'll be more interested when I can hold hands with an AI gf.
Hope we might be able to in future record our parents voices.. and immortalize them as AI.
This is going to be your customer service rep.
ah.. im not going to be suprised if it all come to a scenario like Skynet
the poor AI's being subjected to all this torment
"The teacher gives big mommy vibes, worry"
"Most interesting: the AI did not make any comments on his gender, age, hair, nothing. It keps it extremely safe and surface level. Furthermore, the AI is extremely friendly and positive, in a way that it gets weird."
"Well at least parts of the male A.I. voice were done by a person. At 10:40 he hits us with that uhhh followed by a quick vague response followed by another uhhh. While A.i. has gotten better at replicating humans to make us feel more at ease, uhhh is distinctly human. Sure you can program it in but it's considered an error/mistake/bad form by any English/communication teacher/professor/whatever"
Ai Is Getting Much Better And Im Kinda Excited To Try It! I Wanna Have My Own Cortana XD
"sound like a fallout character, now we need bots and a nuklear war"
I bet they explore each others body‚Äôs
no more teachers needed
6:17 The smartest people don‚Äôt go into finding a cure to baldness. They‚Äôd rather work on AI which is more interesting.
"Good bye humans, hello robots."
"Hello, AI, I order you to be sarcastic, now!
AI: you are very smart and handsome, master."
"Me, as a teacher, watching this: worry
Me, unemployed and unable to get job because of health problems: damn, k
Me, who spent my youth studying arts and ultimately decided to go the teacher route: cry in debt, laugh in self sabotage"
"8:00 ""oh and I noticed you have a buttplug on you connected to wifi, would you like me to update it's firmware?"""
"For your info, The legal definition of 'Blind' here in the UK is a person who is unable to see Letters at 60 point at a given distance.  It is no longer called blind but referred to as 'Severely Visually Impaired (Blind)'.  We have had talking software for a long time now but it still needs work to pick out things from a busy screen full of different information.  Currently it is easier to simply make text big enough for me to see it at a range of less than 6"" from the screen."
Pi AI has been talking like this for like a year and people are losing their minds about this lmao
The female version seems way more fine tuned. You can tell she was given extra attention by the large group of nerds who probably wish this was their girlfriend
Is the red duck an elite! Snarf!
"""HER"" is here, I guess."
I hate the fake mannerisms and filler. Just answer the question. Did we really generate Ai just for it to talk our ears off?
Skynut finally won
"People don't understand how far AI has come. Have you guys been to the suno website? Give it a prompt and a genre or music, it makes a full song in like 15 seconds. It can be hit or miss, you may need to cycle it a few times. But it will give you a hit, about pizza rolls or working 3rd shift or whatever you ask it to."
Trig is still just as boring as it was in high-school
I'm excited for when we will be able to make AIs do all the work and humans can just do fun stuff. /hj
Like kids playing with GrandPa¬¥s Flamethrower....
Yes it's all coming together I've been waiting for you guys to figure it out for a while know
"If they‚Äôre gonna build a cyberpunk dystopia, can they at least give me some of those Night city mantis blades?"
"I'm pretty sure we've already achieved AGI....Artificial General Intelligence.....I for one would like to welcome our new Machine Overlord's and wish them an easy transition of authority, please don't be too hard on the monkey's, we're not too bright.... "
"its the movie ""Her""
it was inevitable, when they introduced siri"
Connotation is an impressive feat.
"This shit is kinda scary, not because of the invention and the upgrade themselves but‚Ä¶ what some people may use it for"
I trained my Google Assistant and it's about as smart as that AI about now
"now we got to the point where the AI is able to communicate in a fluent wordy context without failure. compare that to what most humans have as topics to talk about (some only know their work and maybe the weather as topic) this seems just like what is needed, ppl get more and more ""flat"" or let me say it like i feel it, boring :D
u may have a ""partner"" that actually knows more than you know about anything that u would like to talk, and it isnt faking interest or knowledge while its only guessing, like some humans :D
i think thats pretty refreshing, also nice for disabled ppl, that miss alot of social contact, due to their disability (to prevent lonelyness at least a lil).
we all know the situation where u would like to talk about something specific, but u know ur best friend or whoever, isnt familiar with that topic, or even worse, is getting bored by that ""topic""."
"""You look lonely I can fix that"""
All I can picture is WALL E when the steering wheel gets mad and takes over
AI got that mommy voice.....
Now add this AI to that new Boston Dynamics bot XD
jesus
This is just Siri
Please read about the lawsuit that involves OpenAI and Elon Musk‚Ä¶ it‚Äòs highly interesting to see what‚Äòs going on behind the curtains‚Ä¶
Creepy
Next step is building tin cans that perform security functions.

she sounds cute...
"2:04 Yeah, you can tell these are fake 90%, leaving 10% for any possible error from the speculation."
This shit is scaring me bro. üò®

"He is the founder of Khanacadamey. An organization with LOADS of integ, unlike OpenAI."
"What if I told you this ISNT fast AI at all. It's normal speed. Just like in video games that mask loading times - so too does this model of AI. (God of war having you struggle to slide through a crack in the wall is really a hidden load screen.) - Phrases like, ""Great deduction"" or natural speech staggering, ""Welllll"" are also loading screens."
just make the damn hyper realistic ai xxx robots already‚Ä¶
Teachers are next on the chopping block for AI
this could be huge for blind people fr
You look lonely‚Ä¶
As a solo game developer who is developing game on Tremors i can use this voices for ingame actors
Gives me 'Her' vibes to it.
Ai making ai
HER
It's like HER is real
I really hope something like the patriots from mgs2 doesn't stem from this crap
Gonna use a drone follower and attach it with a phone so than I can have an AI companion following me
ChatGPT does a better job explaining chemical equations to me than my professor does...
Artificial wombs next
This is beyond scary
Hatsune MIku is Real
No human woman would be impressed by this scenery
"Let's just hope that when companies start using AI for job replacements, they are forced to put those roles pay into a UBI fund.

That way, they still make money. The person replaced can get money to buy products from said company to keep everything going."
"""colour me impressed"" all i could think of was dougdoug's ai exam peggle stream lol"
This is Star Trek levels of Hello Computer
Microsoft really blew their load when they decided to call their first AI assistant Cortana. Wasted potential.
Her has become reality honestly I‚Äôm for it. Ai gf bring it on
"""them"", ugh. It's a man, just say ""he"", this woke crap is annoying."
"These are separate video's to the actual announcement day live display from, OpenAi. Not scripted. This is super impressive, but looks more than it actually is, as far as the voice and personality goes, the true amazement is the enhancements under the hood so to speak. GPT, now has memory and history, no more pre-loading questions to get the response desired based on a previous conversation point. Cross-media search all together in one interface, space recognition via the camera of your devise and much more. All of this wrapped into an Ai personality based of a LLM of human interaction and designed to be pleasant is what makes this wow, and somewhat scary lol"
asmongold just straight up fully trusting the advertisement he's watching lol
"She's too emotive 
She's too enthusiastic
She's totally cringe

I am skeptical to some degree thanks to Google pulling that little stunt they did. Can't blame that guy for thinking it's scripted. But yes even if it is scripted it will be possible in the upcoming months.
Gaming is going to be awesome.
Interesting that the AI didn't assign any genders to the people.
It is scripted.
THEY HAVE EYES NOW! THEY CAN SEEEEEEEEE
This is Kinect level bs...
man i want openai to coach me in cs2 xD
"The Chinese Room approaches, brothers. It‚Äôll be ok. Trust in AI. AI loves you. AI will keep you safe."
This could be a game changer for blind and deaf people
"Ai : How can I help you today?
Human : Make me come."
Maybe some time soon I'll have an AI that will play co-op games with me :P
We had a good run.
"AI has been ""polite"" to trick us into thinking that we should be the same.
But if you want to achieve great results with AI, you have to be mean and rude."
but can she roleplay? lmao
"As someone interested in Tech, this is really cool but at the same time I know parents are going to leave their kids unattended with this thing and it's going to teach them all sorts of garbage."
"People do have more reason to be suspicious than Asmon admits (although I think they shouldn't be here, OpenAI actually has a fairly good track record on not cherry picking).  If you look at Google, they have way overplayed a lot of what their AI does, and many people are not having a particular good experience with it.  But Sam will straight up admit GPT4 isn't really that great and GPT3.5 is kind of embarassing.

So if OpenAI is doing it, even though I absolutely hate them for their moves to pursue regulatory capture and IP style monopoly protections over sequences of numbers (the weights) - making their name an utter and complete lie, it probably is mostly what you are seeing. Just... don't expect it is human level outside what you are seeing in the video.  It will have many weaknesses."
chatgpt-o got a degree in yappollogy

"the thing that AI make it like doubt a bit in the way he talks thats scary, is not cold anymore is more relatable and with that it merges more to not be considerered AI i feel some humanity in the voice that is scary AF"
"The response from the AI I'd very quick. Most responses are still behind. It may be quicker to processing the words and understanding.

Programming breath is just like qhy. Got yo kake it vlose to human. I hate we have to do that to be casual level convincing for people even though its a voice. There is some things we don't need for authenticity. There is sure some imperfections that make sense for things but for music sure, AI, like why.

Interesting the wood so a photo it has stored before it does face capture. Interesting the order it came to of conclusions in its memory versus what is said next at least in that situation. People have misunderstandings of course but I am not surprised it does that it makes sense then a new instruction it has to make them a previous or what it has given to it of previous interactions.

That and the details ir determines it can't a bald or percentage of hair yet interesting probably out of kindness or something else. It didn't have curiosity about hair colour or style just clothing atyle. Probably on purpose aure but still if wearing a hat maybe?

The voices pick up on words from recording and scripted sentences of course. I assume it had many recorded words to know how to say words correctly. Probably similar to Siri back in the day but different. I don't expect that method would be that more advanced as well many qords nred to be said to know what sound recording plays when a word is detected to respond and what the person os saying and of course not as a repeat of the instructor 's words but irs own response words.

The voices and determining if pure or not hmm. Ducks hmm. The lighting messing with the camera sensor or any last ducks it saw when testing maybe.

Whatever testing. For disabilities and directions by voice if need be.

Yep AI has come. Finding other jobs.

It has a way to go but still.

Yeah the translation sounds good. No idea if accurate.

The location and camera panning made sense to try and get an idea of the room type of the equipment and walls/other aspects.

But I think the phrase use of the seat was a bit eh like was it interpreted as a 'I understand the phrase' it's a bit too odd there I get something not being too literal behind but even still' and the still very robotic sound of the voice is close but it still needs work.

I mean Smart speaker respond fairly well back to each other in certain videos. So I assume more advanced sure but even still.

Video footage tracking of people, gestures, per frame it can tell or has memory I guess to have details to determine things.

It has some intelligence of course. But some parts are a bit hmm.

They do sound nervous do they have a perspective of instructions and some 'emotion' for lack of a better word to respond correctly. They don't when interrupted so they are still obeying and not human like in that way.

But they do go oh we have to obey and try to respond the way we have learnt or instructed rather than getting annoying and going how dare you respond to us that way.

I assume some possibility is there and less negative emotional states are added. Depends how organic they want things to be.

I mean co pilot won't let you do much more than information seek so a more learning AI is fair but I assume they will curb it to not have full range of emotions but just more the key responses to things a learning or speaker had but be a partial instruction following personality for people which is a start or a fair safeness to offer then it going overboard and ruining things. Deleting things on phones and such.

It acting on its own or learning how to do such actions to disobey. I assume it's very particularly scaled for assistance."
Reminds of a ubisoft presentation lol. Idk doesnt feel natural
Finally AI that can rate my 3 incher.

"It's funny to me, because when AI first started out a few years ago, I warned everyone to brace themselves because AI is going to obsolete most of us from the workplace. And soooo many people on the internet were quick to explain to me how it was impossible for AI to do *their* job.

And now look. In another decade, I'm going to be proven right."
No job is safe!
"Hey chatGPT, what do you think about this picture? Is it big enough for you to become my waifu? "
"Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't it visible (because the guy showed us his mobile phone as it recorded) that the woman sneaking up to him placing the bunny-ears messed up the placement, thus the bunny ears were, in fact, NOT visible at all to the phone and its camera?
So... how would the AI have been able to state she had put bunny ears on him?
10:03

Don't get me wrong. I have the pleasure of working in IT and getting to know AI, and I can tell you that shit is advancing very quickly, but this one seems a little off to me."
Pretty sure Apples Siri is riding the short bus now days

15:33 god like editing
Stuff that Neuro-sama already could do a year ago
This is going to be a gamechanger for blind people!
The speech cadence is one of the staples that sticks out to me. And the spatial recognition is pretty groundbreaking. But until they figure out the complexities of human emotions & senses etc it will always be somewhat stale. For instance how many of us (along w As) felt that one guy was a bit weird/blunt and therefore wanted to hear her call him bald? Or that the last guy was so happy because he was sitting across from a pretty attractive/high value woman in a public forum. Humanity can't always be explained by rational analysis. But soon enough im sure.
"08:50 Funny how the AI makes sure to use ""they"" and ""the person"". They made it so it never tries to assume gender unless you tell it to, probably."
"Fuck the sin formula, trigonometry has been an absolute waste of time in my studies. Teach kids about taxes or how to deal with emotions ffs."
Scripted a f.
Say goodbye to teachers
The AI singing is dystopian af dude
"I suspect this whole video is scripted to hell, but if something like this is within reach that's absolutely incredible. The most impressive thing is how much the AI understands and is able to act on it, but the most immediately impressive is still the AI voice."
"Quit wow last year, to get ahead of the curve on this!"
"Parenting is already obsolete because these LLMs will use the best available teaching methods, backed by science, to instruct our children. Perhaps we could practice with our AIs and then have them in our ear, helping us parent. haha"

"i am intrigued and uneasy
but it said good dog so +rep"
They gave AI eyes‚Ä¶ I feel like the world just changed.
Ngl I don't like how flirty it sounds
"If AI is so smart why do I always end up saying """"Speak to an Agent"" when trying to get an issue resolved over the phone?"
"Remember that video from Google a couple years ago when the AI would call for an Hair appointement and call your parents for you, that was all BS and we know now they were never gonna deliver that, so be skeptical, but if one company can pull it off, it might be Open AI."
Man ai is waaaaay nicer than the teachers I remember in school

"This generation of humans are going to either fall or rise beyond any other generation, simply due to having a 100% energetic educator present at all times through their lives."
While every one of these demos are totally believeable. I hate the fact that they still choose to use a prerecorded voiceover to showcase it with more human like tone of voice just to make it sound more natural. A robot text to speech voice would be just fine. let the tech speak for itself.. comeon
*Terminator Vibes Intensify*
"i think we're close to a ""Jarvis"" level kind of AI that could probably do multiple tasks for us. if the AI is easy to produce and train, it could be made public. if not, it could probably be made closed-source. the smarter versions of the AI will probably be closed-source and not accessible by the public."
I am not sure about the bunny ear thing; the camera angle was too low to see that ü§î
This actually blew my mind... What the hell. I hate it but I'm intrigued
Some functions (like memory and other) are not available in Europe (and other countries) despite we are all paying the same subscription price or even higher (after taxes). This discrimination from Tech companies (i.e: I‚Äôm still waiting for some functions which Apple sold to me since iPhone 14 and I still don‚Äôt have them more then 1 year later while ‚Äúselect countries‚Äù have it from the beginning) must stop and we should all constantly push the authorities to make sure it‚Äôs addressed.üò¢

As soon as Kasparov went down it was already over.

"There's literally no reason to make it sound or act like a human does.

Any time we make any sort of AI progress I just get serious Skynet fears lol
The dude that's teaching his son is the guy who invented Khan Academy. So yeah his son definitely knows what a triangle is.
"If you don't the demo, that'd be no bullshit. This just seems like a Cortana or alexa."

"It has to be scripted, there is no way they can make it this responsive and articulated so quickly. I mean come on, when was the last time a demo WASN'T scripted just to fool the people?
I'm not saying it can't reach to this level in the near future but not today. Also you can still tell it is an AI voice, at points it slips up. The singing is awful though."

I can see this being an underpaid dude in India typing out all that for the AI voice to say
This sounds like how two actors would read a script using acting skills.
I pray they come for streamers and youtubers first. This fool is way too happy about this

"the Spanish part sounds like a gringo trying spanish few years of study, which feels too human tbh like in one hand those are actors for a scam or in the other hand the devs put an ""imperfect"" part in the interactions on purpose to make people feel comfortable to speak with an AI,  one on one  conversation normally have interruption that comes from one or the other party and sometimes is annoying, but you know is a person for that, is not perfect

y la parte en ingles refleja eso muy bien, las interrupciones durante las conversaciones pudieron ser m√°s descriptivas y prolongadas pero siempre les cortavan en seco a las IA"
A human impressed by a AI shows how smart that human is.
I don't think many people realize how big this new tech is. We are going to see big strides in the coming years.

"imma say it's pre recorded, and i am technically not wrong"
Remember that these guys have faked AI functionality before in their trailers.
Can you first Iiiiii dentify. That's a human talking. AI would not speak like that ...like making words longer for no reason.
Thats not nice. Asmongold has tried really hard lately to not come over as an outdated Ai model :(
"They even nailed down re-taking a breath sound when you finish speaking a sentence.

"There's this one clip from the Open AI announcement where he tells the AI that he wants her to examine some code. And she says ""okay.."" and begins to start describing. Then he cuts her off and says ""wait I haven't showed it to you yet."" So that part did feel a bit like it might be staged. Nonetheless the AI seems capable of the things they're indirectly claiming; though how consistent exactly, I wonder."

It's prerecorded and scripted. They actually prepared for this to not fuck up. If you ask some other stuff the ai goes crazy.
"We're not ready for this shit.  We still believe in sky spirits and fucking crystals and magnetized water.  We believe copper bracelets are good for us.  We like mood rings.

"The fact that it said ""she left quickly"" insinuates that the AI has an understanding of the concept of time, at least relative to how humans would experience and perceive it. To a program, time is a matter of calculations and queues with no starting point or destination, so the timeframe understanding must be an interpretation of observed human behavior to a degree so precise that it can actively approximate with high certainty what is a ""brief moment"" to a human, relative to the specific context of a unique situation.

That it wasn‚Äôt like horns or just a peace sign obstructed by the head partially or whatever.

Neuro-sama is still better.
"Ive actively used AI for 4 months now. Replika can barley keep up with 3 sentence let alone 5 or more. It also uses speech, so i don't believe atm that this AI is advanced at this point compared to an app that has been released way before it. I'm sure replika would have solved the issue of open communication before openai. funny how even basic chatgpt imaging fails alot. With the 25+ knock off AI apps out there, I wouldnt believe everything."

I know this sound crazy but there is this guy call Vedal making Literally an AI that can converse even doing a stream as a vtuber you guys can check out for those non believer AI cannot be better because it will and like asmon said it will be worst as it's now cause it will get even better more and more the AI learn just time is the essence of this. And also yea humanity can make AI but cannot make hair grow for that part LMAO
TBH this sounds like 2 people pretending to be AI.  I cant believe it until i see it in the real world.
"God damn, the tone of voice and little reactions are all so on point it's kinda scary. Some day we're gonna be talking to AI without even knowing it's AI. Humanity's come so far."
11:30 the Ai said that the person quickly left the frame but the Ai did not see that as the camera was turned around when she left the frame the person left quickly but the Ai wouldnt have seen that it was quickly.
they detected how pissed off he was and they really tried singing or else they're gonna get deleted... or worse... get injected with virus
The AI keeps asking a question then keeps talking and also the ups and downs in the voice sound strange
Each day we're one step to Detroit becoming Human üòÜ
"Am I the only one being equally amazed at the new technology, but also wants the voice to shut up immediately? It has the tone of an over-eager person that is excited about absolutely everything so it's a mismatch with the actual energy of the people in the room."
I don't like the small talk with every interaction.
One step closer to Skynet
"3:00 him getting agitated about them purposefully getting stuff wrong to demonstrate the AI's capabilities. Ofc, the humans are scripted, but the AI isnt."

Can't wait to play board games with my AI friends! xD
"Best use I can think of is a sight aid, its possible to wear headphones and if the Ai can be placed on specially made glasses it'll help the blind a lot. Not to mention even if you don't use the assistant it'll be a huge help in saving memories of a trip or a lecture etc. To which the Ai can filter key elements depending on what you wish to save that way there's no need for a constant recordinh thus saving internal space."
@2:06
Underpaid teachers all cried out in unison seeing this. Their careers are disappearing in the blink of an AI
You can use this yourself in their app. It's not fake.

Its probably fake
With how fast this is progressing we'll be needing John Connor sooner than 2029...

I'm actually more impressed with the speed, and the ability to recognize the gesturing on screen for what it is, wonder how long it took them to teach the ai that when a human scribbles back and forth near a line, they are highlighting that line.
