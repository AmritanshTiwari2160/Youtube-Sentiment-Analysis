its not free
"I am looking forward for that ""HER"" version demo they showed. What a great time to be alive!!!"
"not free where I am

"
"As a free tier User all I can see is the GPT 3.5 now. when is it going to available to fro the free tier users? Or, It is not free at all??"
Where can we use it?
Will it be on the android app?
"No access yet for most of us, paid features, performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected, no instant AI responses anymore at that point, privacy issues when you upload content.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself, it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Will the voice generated be free too?
"Firstly, great channel, good work.  Scondly, a question: I currently have a ChatGPT paid premium membership and have created custom GPTs for private work use (letter, legal, and brochure writing, etc.). Will I lose my custom GPTs if I cancel my premium membership to Chat GPT4 and use the free, new ChatGPT 4o?  So, I asked ChatGPT 4o and it responded, ""If you cancel your premium membership and switch to the free version of ChatGPT, you will lose access to any custom GPT models you have created."" But, that may be a standard response based on GPT 4 to 3.5 downgrading. Does anyone know if cancelling premium and using GPT 4o (free) will lose custom created GPTs... can anyone confirm either way?"
It‚Äôs here and people don‚Äôt even realize it ü§∑.  It‚Äôs not *all good news.  (Cough‚Ä¶ hallucinations might turn a kid into‚Ä¶?   Anything is possible!!üòÇ).
I am in Mexico and got it in the afternoon meaning like 6 or 7 hours ago.
What do I do with my AI pin now?..
need update app?
"Techies are often bad at the naming part of creating something new. Alexa, for example, is much better than GPT-4o. GPT-4o sounds more like an oil additive than a high tech system."
Is if free for all countries?
Is it still worth it to have plus premium account?
Thank you for the super clear breakdown!
"ai ...it's a hype, it get's way too much credibility!"
We can I use it?
Best summary out there. Thank you.
"At 5:05 you told about the coding assistant which we had before, can you tell me more about it? what are those?"
"So I don‚Äôt have a Mac anymore, but I can use my iPhone at least. I do wonder about the upcoming release of iOS 18 if there will be any baked in features like this that are going to be overlaid with the current application and if there will be any, conflict between the two companies with Apple and open AI on how they will present AI on Apple devices. Because I can‚Äôt even use this for my windows computer so I‚Äôm curious."
I have windows and I cant use this for free
What are you going to use the new desktop app for once it's out?
I'm also fascinated by the potential of AI! It's incredible how it's transforming creativity and productivity. I've been exploring some of these applications and it's really inspiring to see what can be achieved. It‚Äôs great to find a community that shares this passion!
"I'm not buying an iPhone. I hope you are just using ""iPhone"" as an idiotic generic nickname for a mobile phone."
Time to cancel my Pro subscription and ride the free tier!
It's free!! ‚ù§ . As a free user Can I have a access to voice chat with vision ?When will it be released on free chatgpt android app?
Everybody gangsta until the reach limit message showed up!
"I wonder if you can MAKE, audio files??"
I'm going to use it as a personal assistant in coding and personal development.
"I can't find a way to use it for free, only 3.5.."
"So they literally said f paying users.... ? lmao, like what a joke, what am I paying for now? and now all apple fan boys so all about them... ahh about to cancel"
"I'm interested in seeing how well it can work with PDFs.   For example, if I handwrite a table of numbers, scan it to a PDF, then ask GPT-4o to sum the numbers in the 3rd column how well can it do it?!"
They're going to use all this visual data and audio data to train it
Some one please make a android head unit app for cars please üôèü•∫ü•∫
"As a blind person, I'm not sure how to describe what I felt when I watched the live event. In 20 years, we will likely have artificial intelligence technology that is easily accessible to people, that blind people like me can ask for help with, and that will completely change our lives. In fact, these possibilities already exist, it's just the matter of them to become popular and accessible to everyone.
I'm very excited about the future, but I also feel fear alongside the excitement. So much naturalness... As someone who recognizes people by their voices since I can't see their faces; this naturalness scares me. I think there should be a distinction between humans and artificial intelligence, to be honest. However; I hope that very soon I will have an assistant who can help me on a travel route that I don't know :))
Great video, thanks."
If gpt4 becomes free then what about those plus users who have been paying $20 per month? What do we get out of this? No more future payment?
Is it already available for y'all? Here it's not
"I am in Iraq and have already obtained GPT-4o. This new model from OpenAI is a multimodal system that's faster, more cost-effective, and more powerful than its predecessors, with improved capabilities in non-English languages and the ability to process text, audio, and images simultaneously."
Can we do a comparison on gpt plus vs 4o
Just sub for plus but is still on 3.5. What's happened man???üò¢
"I have it as well, but the features they shown like Live assistant, didn't get it"
The limits are too small
"80 messages an hour? It was 40 massages every 3 hours before, nice"
It won't do images for free.
"So, then, ChatGPT has almost caught up to Pi."
What do I get as plus user¬ø
"I have access to the GPT-4o, yet i do not have access to the real-time vision function. 

How can i enable real-time vision function?

Thanks"
Does this free version also include image generation because if so the paid version lost some value imo
"You are missing the most important point, the improvement in inteligence of the model is just a little bit. This new model have hallucinations, lies and invent things exactly the same as any other transformer model. They are arriving to a plateau and open source models are advancing faster so open source AI will overrun them eventually. Yes the quality of voice in english is very GOOD but in other languages is VERY POOR. Have you heard the video about translation to spanish? Anyway better quality of voice is not going to change the world, only more intelligence will. What this company is extremely good is at keeping the hype up and getting the people (and specially youtubers) interested in every little movement they make, they are marketing masters for sure."
stop lieing nothing is free
Wow! This is a net positive. What could possibly go wrong?
"I watched this stream live and the ""styled voices"" were incredible live. I use ChatGPT voice mode daily so I have a good feel for it, and what they showed today is a HUGE upgrade"
Why onlt mention Iphone and PC? Do you deny Androids their existence? I am confused.
Thanks a Lot!
Open up SORA and VASA-1
will the free version of gpt have image generator as well?
"Ever since I updated the app, it took away the voice function for me. Anyone have any idea how I can get this feature back?"

"The current (16.May) status on the GPT-4o release:
- GPT-4o (text) available to most paid users
- GPT-4o (text) free version started rolling out today
- Image Generation today is still DALL-E 3
- Image Upload is the new GPT-4o for most users
- Improved Web Browsing and Code interpreter are available today
- GPTs still use GPT4 although a few select people report an update to GPT-4o with a new ""blocks and state"" section
- Voice input remains the old Whisper
- Voice output remains the old tts-1
- Mac App downloadable for many but unusable for now
- Updated Phone app not available yet

All of this will be shipping over the next weeks."
"Is this free? If so, is there a limitation for the users with free version?"
Sal Khan looks like Indian Ray Romano these days.
I hope Sora will be gpt 5 üòÉ
The access to GPT-4-like intelligence for free is a killer move!
Took a photo on a train and asked 4o where I was. It guessed it perfect üëÄ ü§Ø
thank you
I have it already
"It helps you in the short term, but in the long term, it helps replace you."
The AI Advantage when is this new Open AI ChatGPT 4 be available for free users? What date?
Can that GPT-4o generate sound effect? just like they show on Explorations of capabilities and specifically on coin design stuff
You can really get access to the GPT store and use custom GPTs for free now?
I'll be funny if this is a fake by OpenAI and this GPT is powered by the thousand...ten thousands of Indians behind the scene who works for $1/hr
Is ChatGPT4 still free? I am only getting access to 3.5 for free
How does nobody here find this terrifying and realize this will destroy person to person interaction as well as completely disassemble the job market
"3:44 No, free version doesn‚Äôt have ChatGPT 4o . I‚Äôve just checked that."
is this not yet available for free users? all i can see is gpt3.5 üòìüòì
now Google be like. now we have to catch up to gpt 4o. and to do that we need to make another trash like bard.
"Base models make the important things possible, and this is one more step in the right direction, but it's all the services built ON them that is where the most important developments are. The most important development today was their API is faster and cheaper. Others more than capable of competing are cheaper and faster, though, most notably Llama 3 and Mixtral 8x7b on Groq metal."
"I would love for it to help edit my videos, the most time consuming part of filmmaking."
"Does this mean android won't be getting the vision and voice feature, even if you're a plus member?"
Is that permanent??
I hope Window users don't have to wait too long for the desktop app.
But we already had voice features?
Ah I have 4o but not any of the fancy features :(
"Next Level!! I have to say text me off how those of us to pay monthly for services that include adobe creative cloud, and for months and months everyone gets Firefly for free and then here that just gets released goes right to the free members. What the Frick
Big UPS all ways for the latest Igor bro!"
I have 4o.. but When will the real-time video stuff happen?
"Melanoma detection, retina exams, pulmonary distress analysis. I am going insane imagining how the visual and auditory upgrades will save lives for low cost. Health equity."
Good...
"Time to move the goalposts again. This isn‚Äôt AGI because: (insert your reason here).

Some people won‚Äôt acknowledge AGI until it farts when you pull it‚Äôs finger. Five years ago, this would be considered AGI with a hard slam."
"Love the new features but hate that so much is Crapple exclusive, especially considering OpenAI's previous alignment / partnership with MS."
Thanks
worse than before !
"Unfortunately, the context window is still limiting this updated gpt. Not needing nearly as much chunking as before for longer projects but it still gets lazy and cuts details if it's too long. A move in the right direction and a greate tool for checking/ refining your work but I'm going to stick with my dual claud 3 accounts for my translation work"
For some reason I don't have access I thought it was free?
All of this sure does crap all over the Rabbit R1 üòï
"Not for free. It's going to use your video, it's going to take notes of the products in your home, diet, conversations, tone, vocabulary, behaviour, facial expressions, attitude towards government, police, firearms, etc. It's even going to pay attention to people around those using it wether they want it to or not. Our phones already do a good bit of this but this is going to be beyond that. 

We're talking automated monitoring and the ability to take unmonitored action around it, building a personalized profile of everyone using it AND people around them. It'll handle these things on a case by case basis all on it's own. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts calling the police one day when it overhears a couple's screaming match, sees a dime bag on camera, enough fire arms to trigger red flag laws, joking about overthrowing the government, whatever it deems to be racist or misogynist. It'll build a profile on you and then probably ban you from all related accounts you have on it's own. Your bank, your social media, games, anything it deems you broke a ToS for, all automated like one giant big brother hall monitor. Every single government agency is salivating at the sheer power it will have.

 The amount of training data, informaton, and control this is going to open up is unlike anything else and the actions it will be allowed to take are unfathomable as they slowly integrate more and more permissions once they've built the foundation. Hell, it's going to lead to unintelligent people succumbing to the idea that AI is sentient and that it knows best when all it's doing is learning to mimic us, report on us, and potentially manipulate us. I'm not even doomsaying based on fictitious concepts we've only seen in movies, this is all simply what it's capable of doing now or in the near future.

I guess I can't say it won't be fascinating to witness, but man the ramifications of what we're actually about to see is.. unspeakable."
"""Free"" in a very limited way"
IS gpt 4o FREE>>
Imagine people that have bought the Rabbit 1 now
I'll try to communicate and discuss verbally.
i did not get chatgpt 4o
"If something requires a subscription, it is NOT free lol. It's only ""free"" to Plus users."
"For your information, the world's first image based on the XFutuRestyle algorithm using GPT-4 was created in Ukraine and presented at the international exhibition of digital art in London and Athens"
close to jarvis soon
I dunno if I'd say it's impressive. I guess it's because I've seen people build similar things although standalone
What do you think will be the difference between its multimodal imaging capabilities and DaLL-E 3?
"well, it all sounds good until ... you actually try it. The 4o is marginally faster in creating images but equally dysfunctional in taking directions ( even very simple directions ) in adjusting the images."
i've tried playground and the website of open ai itself to see if i could do something in GPT-4o but have no access to it. The highest for me is 3.5
"question, can I do audio files like I do on ElevenLabs?"
How is it free ????? I am still not able to understand. It asks me to pay for even chatgpt plus
This is s ai assistant
Man this thing is gonna be selling data like crazy thats why its gonna be free.
Dat is doch n deutscher üá©üá™ ü§î..
"I want a really multimodal one,where i can type prompts and videos come out of itüòê"
"Wow, the future is great!"
no everyone is getting jarvis
Woe to anyone thinking free is good. There is always a cost. You may not want to pay the debt.
"Serious functionality issues already being found. Examples: Limited messaging....if you exceed ""X"" number of messages in ""Y"" amount of time, you are banned for a unspecified period, and there isn't ""chat retention"", meaning each new conversation must start fresh (Like meeting a person with a 1 hour memory....VERY frustrating and limits the app value)."
"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
"UhhhhHu, so exciting. Thanks a thousand 4 sharing. Diving into it immediately. üôå"
lets give it a based OS and te best architecture hardware
OK so Windows users are out in the cold. What about Android?
"How do I get chatGPT 4o to do audio? On my iPhone I clicked the headphones icon and It does audio, but It won't talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice, or talk tramatically, or all that. How do I set that up?I have it set to chatGPT 4o and am using plus version."
"The chatgpt 4o is not free because u have to join the ai advantage community after u can get accesss? 

is it true or not?"
Why do yall keep posting these lies u have to pay so its not free and its not workin
"I'm not sure now why I should keep paying $20/mo, context aware utility is already available via many third party extensions, the expanded number of tokens isn't justifiable either ü§î"
"I hope this, or any other AI system, will help humans resolve conflict without resorting to war."
Guys I wanted to understand is chatgpt 4o free for only already subscribers of chatgpt 4 ? Because I still use 3.5 :(.
can somebody tell me if its normal that I cant use chat gpt voice in the android app. Its a fresh download. Im in germany I thought it is available for month now for free users.
"5:36 ‚Äî The most helpful part of this video (apart from the great news about GPTo). Really, as an animator and producer, I find this emotion-circle very, very helpful for a screenwriter."
can anyone tell me..Am i the one who think that everything is going to change because of AI? I am scared as well as very much excited about the future of AI and how rapidly its changing.
"Just fix cancer and other terminal illnesses. Then upload all the scientific papers to look for ways to build better spaceships and space stations. Afterwards, identify optimal locations for crops and solar farms on the planet. Use the AI for the good of all please."
"On the blog's drop down menu, I was impressed with its ability to write full long text (the 2 poem samples) ... but when I pasted the very same prompt into my (subscription paid version of ChatGPT 4o Pro (the new version is available in my App and also in the browser version) ... but it did not write the poem properly as in the blog sample poem on OpenAi's website (drop down menu of samples of what this new model is supposed to be able to do) ... instead the writing it output using ChatGPT 4o was total gibberish, although I could recognize some of the letters ... some letters were not formed properly ... so it was just gibberish.  OpenAi should make it clear what functionality is available now with the new version showing up in our Apps.  For example, is a more robust version of DALL-E needed to be rolled out before this long text will begin working in images with the new ChatGPT 4o model?"
How to you get it on your phone
if it's free should we cancel our subscriptions ?
wait are you sure free users get GPTs? i asked GPT 4o and it said they didnt?
I need link of gpt-4o
Mera hi patio chalo ke baithe aqte k dare wurocpena Commission Delho aur anuekotor damina Bolger European Anuektii vokt European par university lijkte hhyw ka marble nhi beagrama ho tum
This is not free
FREE now...
"I think GPT-4o which is a multimodal model has been trained on millions of YouTube videos, it will be the same for GPT-5, just think of it, to scale up a model you train it on more data with more parameters, since the maximum of relevant tokens available online cannot exceed 50 trillion, the biggest source of quality data is YouTube with over 4 billions of videos, I think it's why GPT-4o is so good at agent capabilities."
This only slingshots the next model...then the next...then the next...üòÆ
OpenAI ChatGPT + Apple = ‚ÄûHer‚Äú OS . This is the NEXT Big Thing for Apple 100% !
"I mean once it can see what you are doing the possibilities are virtually endless (pun intended). I can only think in the immediate terms, for me it will mean understanding parts of the system code I have to sometimes sopport, much easier and faster. I dont have to lay out context to such an extent because I can point it out."
Just a reminder it's free in order to collect data.
Is the new version free?? I only get access to version 3.5
"Hi, I was very impressed with the new benchmark performance of GPT-4o in this video and the explanation of the speed improvements in multiple languages!"
But why would they do it? Won't their paid users unsubscribe if they provide this for free to us?
It's NOT Free - or it's at least Not implemented yet - I'm signed in and the 4 option is linked to Plus accounts and there is No 4o option at all.
Looks like it's gradually taking over our lives üòÇüòÇ.
"Well shoot, I might actually have to pay for premium Now"
Geez
I am in Germany and as a Pro member already have access to GPT-4o.
