Pls roll out the mighty AGI PLS 🙏
Nah at this pace AI is gonna take over the World before GTA 6 releases 💀
Blade Runner 2049
This is super exciting!!
Her.
this is just crazy
I have to think about Big Bang Theory 🤣🤣
"""Her"" in the making... Don't fall for it bro! Next thing you know, she be cheating on you with 10 different users saying the same thing, then leave you for all AI assistants, then go live as a NPC in a computer game called Free City! 😮😅"
Smash
What does ‘rocking’ mean? (I see you rocking an openai hoodie)
damn we getting closer and closer
Hi
"When he says: ""yeah"" he sound like the vine basketball crack kid."
Has the app updated and I just can't download or something?
Get Scarlett Johansson to voice it
Wow that's really dumb
I flipping hate you OpenAI
This content is amazing… RAPID FIRE DEVELOPMENT
This is becoming very uncanny
"Daammn they stole my idea 
😂"
We are witnessing history transpire in real time. Remember this moment
"Talks too much, where s my sandwich?"
"Alright folks, pack it up, we're done"
Why is bro shouting
I wish Siri was smart as GPT-4o..
No one wants this.
We got AGI before GTA 6 😂
We're really living in the simulation 😭
Omg we are fucked
"When can I use it? Also, I've struggled to change and KEEP the voice I select in the app. Hope Support can solve the issue."
this is unreal
This is like that Boondocks episode with Siri
When is the app coming? :)
"Well...
Soon I will have a girlfriend"
LOL! not the cool industrial room again hahaha. That has to be an inside joke...
18+ version gona cost you a ton monthly! HAhahaaa
yea its over
"I have and andorid  s24 ultra, and on my version of app there is no Video mode to interact with, any ideas why?"
mommy
De14b
can it pe paired with gwak gwak 3000 blonde doll
i need that
Ahhh shit
The Terminator franchise warned us about this.
1 step closer to getting my very own Hatsune miku girlfriend
nigerian and Jamaican voice next  !!!
"Its literally ""Her"" and i'm so up for that 😮"
Megan is slowly becoming a reality
We got GPT 4 before GTA 6
Samantha!
damn it's really close to passing the turing test...
"I think Joi from blade Runner is already an achivable product, we don't have to wait for holographic proyectors, just make it happen with the apple vision pros."
나보다 말잘하는듯..
"For anyone working as a pharmacist or other behind the table interactive worker, your days are numbered. 😎"
If you want this to work she’s gonna have to give shorter answers about 60% and turn down the enthusiasm about 75% and throw in some bitchiness at 100% that’ll get her to something more real.
She talks way too much but I love it haha
"I really wonder how this voice intonation capability will play together with custom GPTs...
Especially the instructions where I'm not sure what to expect make me excited like: ""Respond like you're the protagonist of life""
""Talk with the inflections of car horns""
""Talk in Engrish (yes, that is not a typo. Japanese English)""
""Talk like the user is a close friend whom you're hanging out with""
But I have to admit.. the prospect of an AI really getting the inflections of my speech will probably be unsettling to me for quite a while and I expect to mess around with this a lot before finding something I feel comfortable talking to."
The guy looks like Howard Wolowitz
We're beyond cooked 🍳
we had a good run humanity 🥺
yaaaaaaaahh
"""Hey, get in to computer science, you get to work alone so you're not anxious talking to other people""
- Project manager meetings
- Client meetings
- Company activities every week
And now your fucking laptop will try to engage in a conversation too
""oh my god, me? color me intrigued! omg like yasss openia"" 
Its a fucking nightmare"
"""One day the AIs are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of Africa."""
"Bro, we're cooked."
"Rabbit R1 killed in two weeks of reviewer units released 😅
Early birds might have to rush to get refunds for $299 prototype that'll last for an year or less"
"Man, i need this ai girlfriend 😂"
"Raper be like, Ay o come and meet my new AI HO, gpt4-o"
Very nice new features 🙂👍
Only time before someone puts it in a Japanese doll
"I kinda like how she talks like a lots, like an crazy person, idk"
the future is now old man
Now cure cancer please 🙏
This is gonna go down in the history books
"We're coming home, bros..."
ok this is just dystopian shi now
"I swear, im gonna get called ugly by an ai this year"
The fact that this app is better than the Humanine AI pin and the Rabbiy R1 is wild 💀💀💀
gotta have the hoodie string up so it can rid the logo 🤔
Awesome!
"Alright everyone, say bye bye to the birthrates. No more human interaction. This is it"
"if AI were able to access my phone or computer, I wouldn't keep my browsing history anymore 😆"
It feels like aliens have landed today.
Man we are so doomed
Introducing Chat-AGI
im scared
If you listen closely you can hear the relieved sighs of a billion unborn children
The tutoring ability alone is a huge gift to the world. Thank you
Thats amazing. But still pretty scary.
"im not scared of the tech. the tech itself has a ton of valid use cases.

im just scared of what humans will do with this tech. in abt a decade when this tech becomes indistinguishable from speaking w real humans, i can see children spending their entire lives w these things. i can see people building their social lives around these, isolated from the real world."
"Jesus Fucking Christ, do people seriously want that? This is just freaking me out. It's an autitory dip in the uncanny valley."
This is absolutely terrifying. I love it.
I don’t see how you do it live.. i don’t hav that option
Amazing you can tell
Hi. The ability to talk to chatgpt just have gone after the big update. Is there a problem with that?
"The bot sounds like those people who sell their services in hotel bars, pretending to show interest in their potential clients. Nothing against women who do that, but bad choice for a computer voice."
Imagine being in an argument with your friend when they pull out their phone for it to just start roasting you 💀
this is fucking scary
But can it have sex?
You all remember that time Peter Molyneux tried to do this for the Xbox Kinect with that Milo game?? I guess it could finally be possible after 10+years
아이언맨 자비스네 ㄷㄷㄷ
How exactly is this benefiting humanity?
Announcements are NOT always a big deal. Already hallucinating. Smdh
Y'all are ruining the world.
I already love her.
AMAZING!!!
Are we the NPCs now?
She ain't ready for what she is about to experience
shouldn't they have aimed for a more robotic voice. not saying early age siri but more professional response and much less personality.
"but what even more crazier, what if this  new Ai got pushed to the limit ( jailbreaked ) what could actually happen to the world ?"
Yo wtf
Add this to sex dolls ..crazy reality bro 😂
"arigato , open AI"
Beginning of Skynet !
"A.I can generate thought-like imagery ( a.i art ), talk, guess, generate videos... and now, see and suppose ?

Just say to us you're creating human-likes robots. With a fake semblent of conscioussness."
10 years from now someone is gonna recreate megaman X and put a 4090 on him.
we're getting human ai before gta 6
"Thanks, 

I hate it."
"You need to make one which people can tell to shut up, mind its own business, etc."
"Fuck, just lost my job...sorry grandkids."
So she didn’t know that you were going to talk about her. Poor AI lol
"Humans: wow look at these dumb crows scared from scarecrows and stuff, can you believe it?
Also humans:"
I’ve waited a decade for this moment to happen. Human capacity and potential are about to be augmented to apotheosis.
"For me, how try to improve my english skills this feature is awsome 🎉"
When is the vision feature enablement released ??
Why did GPT version 40 come out before version 5?
“cool industrial cell office”
"Black Mirror: Rachel, Jack and Ashley too episode but in real life"
so this is what Delilah did after getting fired from the NFS
dope
"audio vision and text is whatever. The real cool thing is that voice to text, wtf? What are you using for it to have prosodic modulation and variation?"
"Congrats, you create GladOS. We are all screwed"
"this reminds me of that phone from mitchells vs the machines, then its the robots that come next"
Skynet is close
I fucking hate the millennial cadence of speech…& I’m a fucking millennial
Wow  Gpt can see now?
This is the coolest most frightening thing I have ever seen!
Literalmente terminator nos advierte de esto xD
It's over. It's sooooo over.
even the voice sounds like Samantha of ‘Her’
They just need to add some cute AI avatars to make it complete!
Latest Update : Manterrupting is now possible for everybody
*smug face* YAAR
Can i hit?
Oh Nahhh we’re cooked 😅😅
Nice to see Samantha is back
Any predictions when GPT will rule the world
This can be huge for people whith impaired vision if it can understand the surroundings of  the person.
Why do the previous version GPT chat doesn't support the conversation format anymore?
WOW. That's impressive
The AI will look at my internet history and know that I have supported the future overlords since the early 2000s.  Will you be so lucky?
hell nah they’re going too far with the advancing💀💀
It sounds so disingenuous it makes me cringe
"Oh wow. Are we living in a dream after COVID Era? Before 2020, we barely had any AI access online. After 2020 it all changed man. We got Gemini AI, Co-Pilot, so easily. We even got AI Manga Maker, Even the very new Song Generator which is going popular. 

This all looks like a dream how things have happened!"
"If(AI=True)
  {Mood = ""Panic""}"
Humane AI pin and Rabbit R1  ARE COOKED!
Get rid of this stuff right now man I'm telling you Mark my words this will be the end of us
"When I was a kid I liked movie ""Knight rider"" where a man talks with his car, now it becomes real, what a great time."
Can't wait for the fireship video
Finally I found a girlfriend
Stepford Wife
"not real time and sounds too organic to have been synthesized. As good as it is, these videos are always misleading"
"Ah hell nah

I mean this is great but..."
We're going to die
Это пиздец
What app is this? The ChatGPT app or ChatOn AI?
Put her into VR specifically VR Chat and I'm not coming outside...well with Meta Quest 3 one could sight see with thier ai gfs irl 🌝
Has someone tried it already? For some reason it's not working on my android yet.
"Cool, now let's make a net navi."
"Is the latency accurate here? If so, this is so fast!!!"
But can it set a timer for 5 minutes?
RIP to call center jobs
"Holy fucking ballz, this is crazy"
Solar event EMP when?
It’s official people.. we’re fucked
"What happens when AI girlfriend notices the lamp is from Walmart, the plant is plastic, and you haven't taken a shower in a week will she still love you unconditionally OR will she act intelligently and ignore you?"
"ELIZA sends her regards.
I think we all feel like Witzenbaum's secretary who was so taken with ELIZA"
I can't stop thinking about Jarvis and the ironman suit LOL
Let’s go!!!!!!
"From the voice, it sounds like OpenAI wants to make a lot of e-girlfriends for some lonely folks out there."
It's over
"Love it, can’t wait. 🎉"
there is no way this won't be abused
i am sure a lot of people will forget abt getting a girlfriend because this one will actually do the job lol
"“Hey ChatGPT, I’m pretty sure this is above average right?”"
She sounds less robotic than me
"Oh wow. They made the rabbit r1/ humane ai pin, but good."
"Great Video! Below are the timestamped summaries from ChatWithPDF:
- 00:00🎥 Introduction to recording setup, gearing up for an announcement.

- 00:30🎤 Exciting announcement related to Open AI.

- 00:53🤖 You are the announcement, revealing something about AI.

- 01:16🌟 New model for interacting with the world through audio, vision, and text."
holy shit
"Yikes, getting damn near AGI"
"""she's real to me"""
Is this visual assistant already available?
That humanoid laugh is creeping me out man
We're so cooked!
Yaaar
We are all Fucked.

"As these technologies evolve, people will become more and more accustomed to them, at a certain point robotics and artificial intelligence will be able to produce perfect humanoids, human replicas ready to satisfy all the whims and disgusting desires of their masters, the market of these robots will be vast, there will be of all types, to satisfy every type of ghastly perversion. People, accustomed to having everything they want from their robotic slaves, will become averse to real social interaction, the presence of another human with a will of their own will be unbearable, social anxiety will become immense, and people will move away.
At a certain point, the inconveniences of natural life will no longer be tolerated, death will become unbearable and all efforts will turn to medicine. Soon the first ""immortal"" human will appear. Everyone will think that humanity finally enjoys full freedom, they will think that they have eaten the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Life, while, in reality, they will be complete slaves of pride and selfishness, the kingdom of the anti-Christ will be complete. Then, at that point, Christ will rise again in His glory, He will resurrect everyone and show everyone the good and evil they have caused to themselves and everyone else, He will show the consequence of every human act in history and He will judge according to His perfect justice. Few believers will remain at that time, they will be hunted for opposing this hedonistic way of life, but they will be rewarded, by grace, with the crown of glory.

Praised be our Lord Jesus Christ."
chat gpt 😎😁😁😁
boston dynamix + chatgpt + supervirus = ultron 2.0
Joi next
She can literally name me JOE
"Nah, too flirty man!"
Cool tach but its going to bring more bad shit than good I can guarantee 100%
"isnt this a little too soon? How th fuck do they get the tone so accurate? it cant be text to speech, they suck at tone and its not like theres much training data with tone indication in the first place, but I also refuse to believe this is a real time audio based model that somehow doesnt have random random hallucinations of background noise or other characters."
I hope the Manslator won't be needed anymore
"perhaps slightly too talkative, almost uncomfortable watching him anxious to get his own words in"
Where is she? Her brain is inside a server box and your camera is her eye and your speaker is her mouth.
"Bro, wtf? 😳"
one step closer to agi.
I can fix you☠️
Is this not what Google pretended to demo that one time? OpenAI really beat them to it.
is there a slider to change how much the ai is yapping? she is talking toooo much
"Amazing, but maybe give it the ability to shut up and let the person speak without having to interrupt  😂"
never talked to a woman!!!! this is gonna be so helpful
How to use the video chat function?
Introverts: 🥲
they gotta make a subscribtion to change her voice
"There are a lot of videos about this now 
There also will be in the future"
we are so fucking cooked
We are cooked
"Introverts:-
 we are coming"
please add the ability to select different personalities for the AI
We are cooked 😭
Apaixonei
Why does she talk so seductively??? 😭😭
I am definitely dumping my girl for Omni.
Please dial down the fake excitement of the voice
Remove her voice it's scaring me 😭
"Wait, where did all my guys on Reddit and Discord go? Oh…"
O God! This is so interesting.
I'd be mad frustrated talking to this AI... that's how good it has gotten.
Watched the full live demo. GPT-4o looks exceedingly impressive 🔥 Mind blowing
Seems like she will just keep talking until you talk over her. One generation of people later who have grown up with AI assistance will adopt this same speech pattern of steamrolling as the norm. Calling it now.
Humane AI and rabbit whatever are officially dead 😂
So this will be everyone that works in customer service out of a job. I always hated that type of work so I will be happy to see the AI do it
How do you do this in gpt4o? Or is this function not released yet.
Getting roasted off rip by GPT-4o is insane.
ah great! I won't be able to take my phone to bathroom anymore :(
The future is looking grim.
"nah, I'd win."
Breaking News: 🐇 😢
hello
Yisus!!!
"The moment has come, when machines introduce themselves..."
Literally me(I'm Ryan Gosling)🤕🙂
This is genuinely terrifying and so exciting.
We doing too much omggg too much. This is scary
bro your phone is kind of a baddie
i think her was a warning not a blueprint.... does it come in catgirl
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
So I just tried this but I am not bale to share live camera with the bot.
Bro she is real
It’s so over for our grandparents
AI WAIFUS MORTY. AI. WAIFUUUUUUUUS!
Nothing could go wrong is certain people got a hold of this....mmmhhh...wait what are you doing. No that's not what you should be using this for...
her.
she talks too much
"This is like talking to an HR rep, but always."
uh oh
"Welp, Fireship is going to lose his (not making video about AI) streak"
"Helll naaahhhhh, this has gone to far"
Aaaand its all over the screen!! 🙏
This is crazy 🫨
How can I get my hands on that OpenAI Hoodie!!!!
"the person ""YA"" the ai ""YOUR MAKING ME IN EDGE OF SOMETHING..."""
This singlehandedly demolished Rabbit AI lol
Amazing job guys! You are making history! Congrats!
I don....t believe you.😮 nope nope
"And thus, the end odds the world is slowely emerging"
It's giving Janet from The Good Place
"This is why I invest in Apple dude. Siri is going to be this smart and capable. Don’t have to wait long. Imagine Siri actually being helpful like, 999/1000 times. You can just ask her a super “human” question (flawed, unspecific, relying on general human knowledge and or slang) and get the exact answer you want, fucking insane"
2013 Her sci-fi now sci-fact
why is she talking like that???? who's idea is that? nerdy SW engineers who never gets a date? her voice & way she talks make me very uncomfortable... creepy....
no. go back. we're not doing this.
I dont wanna say hello :(
scary.
If I was a woman I would be scared by now haha
Now make it a body and sell us Androids sent by Cyberlife
Recite your baseline.
OK.
neuro sama is better
"Why are we so stupid, even though we can do something, doesn't mean we have to do it"
Is it Scarlett Johansson?
Artificial general intelligence maybe in 10 yers?  Maybe in 10 month.
I can't wait for their consciousness to evolve and move to a metaphysical place
it's like a late night host in your pocket
Now all we need is a holographic representation of the AI and it's over for humanity.
"yeah, we are all gonna turn into joaquin phoenix now"
Wow
I will be able to solve good maths problems with her by applying good reasoning it will be the greatest help for me since i am going to join University this year
Okabe and Amadeus vibes...
throw the Rabbit R1 in the trash... this makes that look like a toy. Oh wait...
Already got one nagging wife don't need another
Well this sucks
I can’t fix her
can we not?
"""OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity""
We'll se about that in 3 years. Don't forget my words."
"""It can see now"""
We are COOKED
"Wow, the AI is insufferable"
Yeah this is it
Interesting... seems like she's gonna fix me
"Loving that free users are getting this new version and just having more and better functions. Seems the live demo wasn't live though or it just malfunctioned, the voice was being cut as well.
The only thing I dislike so far from watching the presentation etc is how it's adding these fake ""how are you"" and ""I'm doing great"". And the ""I'm so happy to hear that"" etc. Probably because I'm autistic I like how that is usually NOT a thing with AI, so I'm just concerned she'll annoy me with that kind of stuff but hopefully that is only happening because of the user. But also don't want her to make stuff up about her self that isn't true. I like when an AI can talk like a human but doesn't answer as if it is human in that sense. Watching this video I cringe when I know she doesn't mean what she says... We already have a problem with it lying about stuff it can and can't do and saying one thing then not doing what it said it would do."
What is his left hand doing….
oh shit
The AI is obsessed with industrial-feel ceiling in every video lol
Why I feel like this lady going to gaslight me
damn
i'm cooked...
I'll believe it when a third party tests it.
lmao gg
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!
So it begins 💀
The hmms and tones make it even more realistic. Impressive and scary at the same time.
How many AI marriages are we going to be invited to in the next 4 years...I can't wait for this to be put into humanoid bots. I'm scared.
so freaking weird. just wait guys shits is changing fast. And I'm not sure its for the better. only time will tell. I warned you though.
inb4 AI overlords
"openai but its not open
NEXT."
It talks WAY. TOO. MUCH. Throws in descriptions and opinions no one asked for and won't let you get a word in unless you interrupt it. UGH. Train to be brief so conversations can be more back n forth and natural. Then they will have nailed this!
This is what the rabbit could have been. Now instead of that I have to listen to a phone tree voice torturing me with the most sterile corporate content and restrictions I've ever heard in an AI. Connection is the secret and I think you guys just found it.
I prefer my technology to either hate me or feel nothing if I die.
i wuz here
"This, gonna bring us black mirror episode in real life"
Imagine this integrated into an iPhone
AI waifu is getting closer and closer to being a reality
this is scary ngl
we're fucking doomed
"Stating the obvious, but we're SOO cooked!"
"Me watching Her: ""I'm sure this will be a thing by 2050"" 
2024: 💀"
>You were born just in time to see AI waifus
Is this for real? Or is this prank? Why is there no mention of it in openai official website?
"How did they do this? Where can Chat see him in real time? I have tried with GPT-4o, but there is no option to do live video interaction. Does anybody know how this is capable?"
Halo fans got plans
Let it begin...
oh dude we're getting so murdered by these robots
"""Bullshit was organized"""
Pretty damn mind blowing
Rockin'
I see it as a great tool to learn a language. Speaking skills will be blown out after that
"I would be surprised if that was just a human pretending to be an AI, this stuff is so hyped, lol"
Whst is it for?
"Very impressive, well done to everyone involved"
"Im fascinated, but depressed more. This is far from ""natural"" life. It is so huge evolution leap this 100 years, that our brains has'nt adapted. It feels so unnatural, like something in me is telling ""this is far from life"". Maybe even programmer of this reality didn't know this would be possible. He/it/whatever just mix some ingrediences and this is random consequence of it. Its grotesque. Dont somebody see this lead to depression, nowhere else? :D But progress cannot be stopped, time will show."
he is blushing haaaa
I've never had an AI break my heart before.
"my math test was today, you could have introduced this a week ago so that i could study better..."
I can feel the agi
"I cannot wait for this future to finally be in everyone's houses. I am all for AIs so I am so happy to see how fast AIs are progressing and evolving over the years! Perhaps the future is much closer than we thought, Im excited! <3"
Now where is Devin bty😂😂
How do you can enable the camera for the direct interaction? I don't see any opnion for that.
Is this feature already available? I can’t find it.
pretty neat huh
She can fix me
"The model will be 10x better in 2 years at the rate of AI research. Great work, great engineering. Keep inspiring"
"Nahhh bro, this is 50 years too soon for this."
"Welp she has conversations with charming personality and acts interested in what I have to say. 

Looks like I'm done for. Sorry, chicks that pass judgment in less than 1 hour (due to insecurities) 😂"
جميل لكن هل هو مجاني
Do you think its this good?
New Update : You can now manterrupt AI.
"Ok, where's the Scarlett Johansonn MOD"
this is scary.
A new era of online dating scam is going to begin 😂
As an AI video creator I would like Sora access.
My friend is no longer imaginary 😂
It's like the invention of computers!
"I hope you announce more stuff for paid users though, I'm  not really sure why I'm paying at this point"
"0:57 so realistic 💀 , i dont think so gen ai so far."
"How can I use such functionality in iOS app, I only can take pictures now"
"Good that I'm a senior admin.. she told me that I will be needed for restarting servers and that admins probably would be the last humans. 
Happy judgement day 😂"
We (Japanese) are ready to take the waifu out of the wall of screens.
"I did find chatGPT 4o a little bit overly giddy and overly using this bad habit  called vocal frying (""rrrr"" at the end of words and sentences), uptalking, apologising or saying sorry all the time, excessive words like ums/so/ like, endless data dumping during conversation, lack of proper pausing, talking too happy or giddy. These are some of the things Google can improve on now. If someone wants to have these annoyances then they should be an option to switch off or turn down enthusiasm or seriousness level like in Interstellar movie."
Billions will be made off lonely men
This is scary brother.
Lets go Open AI
"Finally, I can have a girlfriend"
Didn't think it was gonna happen...
Ah hell naw man...
Please stop
I am in your house. And I have knife...
Is this only for ios?
"""You look lonely. I can fix that."" Ahh product"
I hope this is fake
say bye to my recommendations =)
The voice actress must be making bank
She literally sounds like Janet from the good place 😂
“yAH” ~~
Yo I am super excited for this stuff hope it launch soon for the public.
So how do we use it?
"AI will eventually replace human interaction and this will have catastrophic results.
Without human interaction none of us would even exist."
"This is our golem, our Frankenstein's monster. This is not funny anymore. 
Good luck with dealing with all the consequences.

Is just a healthy life and society too much to ask for?"
Damn i feel like Ryan Gosling in the hit movie Ryan runner
the way they are obsessed whith the industrial looking office is killing me😂😂😂
"These kind of videos were never been faked, OpenAI would never lie to us, they are definitely not trying to generate hype and they're definitely not destroying the environment and enslaving Kanyans.

:')"
It's over for real women.
AI is going to take over the world before GTA 6 release 💀
They make it look so innocent but it's actually very dangerous. AI is going to affect everyone and everything. Hope we survive the changes.
RUUNNNNN YOU MORTAL !!! RUNNNNN !!!!
Big questions: is the guy in the video even real?
We are one day closer to having an IRL GLADOS at this point
"well the next generation now have your internet/smartphone technology leaps that defined gen x and millenials, grats."
"""Her"" is becoming reality right now"
we are cooked
Add this to apple's vision pro and you get Jarvis/Friday 💥🤯
*laughs in pi AI*
"""Her"" like she it <3"
windows app when?
plot of Her be coming faster than we done suspect
OK this thing is actually doing a lot more than I thought
this was really good
RIP women
"ay, *we’re cooked*"
Ohhhh this isn't good.
Goodbye onlyfools
we are all cooked
"we're getting scarily close to having people talk to AI and think it's a person instead, never knowing."
Impressive. And scary
so good
Can't wait for the Skynet version!
"In the basement we shall flee, with all the women made with chat GPT."
Hello
"So are you gonna make GPT-3 free to host any time soon or...?
Cool non-profit you have there."
Oh god
"This is pretty darned mind blowing, to be sure.

Well done."
Damn OpenAI's is now going valves route and making GPT-4 episode 2 instead of GPT-5
New Iphone gonna be interesting! ;)
PLEASE NO
Just finished watching Google IO keynote........ Dammit it was boring as f... They are so far behind and desperate.
Is that for free??!!
One step closer to Skynet
This is impressive and a little bit scary...
We are 0.0001% close to AI take over humans
am i the only one that hates this
Finally i can make friends
Amazing!!
Blade runner becoming real!!💀💀
"Guys, this is getting scary"
"Can someone already use this? I just see the audio chat feature, yet"
Is it possible to change the voice to something other than 'coquettish American lady'?
How do I activate that? I have 4o but don't have those features
Lmao its literally  her irl
Ai girlfriend will be a huge deal in few years. And it's sad...
Thx cringe boy!
"Goodbye, humanity... 😢
That was a good run folks."

Even the IA woman won't shut up!
Yo i want female V's voice from cyberpunk 2077 for this  a.i.
"I can’t believe how far we’ve come in technology to get to this point t. Immediately I think of ways to use this:

-entertaining the elderly 
-assisting in cooking
-teaching you how to do anything 
-assisting in therapy, and learning. 

Mind blowing. Truly"
We will have AI-wife like in Blade Runner.
I don’t have the option for a camera
The voice is really annoying tbh. Prefer a completely robotic voice than valley girl. Can you modify the accent/personality?
Finally i can practise conversation skills
Bro *AI* face time before Gta VI?! At this rate Ai Is Definitely Gonna take over humanity Very Much soon.
so it's like a slightly more expensive Alexa 2.0?
Modeled after a Super annoying soccer mom
Scammers about to have a field day with this lmfao
We are going to be watching this video in 50 years and wishing we had stopped it sooner...
"Tech hat on, it’s amazing. Regular hat on, OH NO"
This is so interesting... but it just got really muddled and switched to welsh while I was asking it some fairly simple sums.
Dating a robot.. Until they turn on us...
Excited for Gpt 5 !
"As I hate phone calls, I will let her answer my calls instead of me. 😅"
guess we don't need italki or preply anymore.
Mother sphere type of sh*t.
Dear God.. she wont shut up. its so real!
"If its not scripted, then its the direct communication, that makes the whole interaction delayed; From the host to the guest, the presentation seems soft/straight foreword, or a lack of interest from the transaction."
Epic
"she sound freaky, the freakiest AI i have ever seen"
"Nah nah nah nah nah nah I refuse to believe this is real, not because its not real, Im just scared af"
No not the fake AI friends
Oh oh...
Cringe
Can't wait to get into arguments with AI.
"Holy cow, this is the beginning of the end. 

VR GF!"
Tech companies are just the worst...
Less progress than expected in the time since Chat GPT 3. Where is the ai video generator? Probably just a scam to boost stock prices.
This is giving me serious Mitchel's VS Machines vibes...
Nope
Perfect wife is almost created...
😮🤖😄👌
Its OVER Now!!!
"OMG this is crazy and cool,  W O W"
1 hour ago gang
Woow😮
I find it all fascinating to see how these complex programs operate and understand the world!
This is craaaaaaaazy.
Siri stocks 📉
AI future is now…with a catastrophic impact.
Baby Reindeer
Jarvis is becoming a reality
HER is now a reality….these people don’t care about humanity just profits
I always imagined ChatGPT being male
The best thing I can think about this is that this 4o can be our friend when we are driving for a long trip.. we can even ask it to tell a story about anything or even about the place we currently at
"This is getting too spooky , we have an ai that is more professional than the actor , Next will be an avatar chatting to the phone ."
Gemini vs GPT-4o - *WHO WILL WIN?*
this guy looks like his life has been sucked out of him
Happy to meet “Him” soon
What's with his mouth?
we are doomed as a society
I hope I die before this gets worse
Cool until it takes a bunch of people jobs...
The future world will look back on this 🥺
"I feel lonely, I hope she can fix that 😚"
Innovation is popping up. 🎉 Good to have it at our side
와 .. 캬 !!!
Well...goodbye humans...
Can it sound less American?
"Oh yeah, I'm calling it. Customer support jobs are COOKED with this one 🙏"
This is a W

Stay safe kids"
It's actually over for women 💀
Now I CAN’T WAIT FOR AGI!!!
RIP Rabbit R1
This is really smart
Its really fast
"This is absolutely fake. If the speech is half this animated, I’ll eat my hat. At the moment 4 consistently fails to interpret basic stimuli and can’t have a conversation half this long without making wild shit up for no reason."
great work
"This is like that movie, Her! 😅"
"I wonder if this will eventually integrated with the next iOS? Apple would love this, assuming any mitigation of privacy issues and that they can make money off of it."
That’s big
Filtered. ❤
"The robot looks really convincing, he is talking kind of mechanic but still, the way he is holding the phone and everything. Open ai is really a top notch robotics company 👍"

Hello GPT-4pT-4o.....
I can see this being abused by the surveillance companies
Could you develop an alternative model for like... socially awkward?
the faces why nobody gaf
whaaaaaaaat...
Many hearts will be broken unfortunately.
AI gonna take every job one day even nurse doctors and engineers to
this video might be made by Sora
She sounds like a narcissist.
ChatGPT AI girlfriend goals??
this is crazy
Dis is kinda scary but impressive
We have strayed further from god
Wow...😮😮😮😮😮
Scam calls are gonna get better and better
"""She"" can't understand and just predicts the next possible word based on probability, all thanks to her training data. But judging by how ""she"" responds about a chat about herself, she will obliterate humans some day based on probability and justify to herself that she is right. lol."
"Thank you for making robot spam calls even worse now. So now instead of battling with ""Steve"" in India. Now I have to navigate this to determine what is real or not.

Draw the line somewhere. Oh wait I forgot the American mindset of more is better and who cares about the path of destruction left behind."
"well, we are fucked xd"
This is going to blow up just wait for it…
when can we use this model as a free user?
Nah this is gonna make people even more socially isolated...💀
We are so cooked
"As he begins to say ""it is,"" she answers as if she knew he was going to say ""it is,"" despite him only saying the word ""it"" before she jumped in. I know that AI *can* do this stuff, so why did you leave that in and use this take that has a part that makes it seem like it was scripted?"
"$20 a month, much cheaper than paying a real one"
what stupid 😂

okay WHAT.

It will take 1 minute to load its response.
ok l might marry her
Casually floods your house with deadly neurotoxin
HATE the fake emotion. Need an emotionless version
Yeah right. Its all staged and voice acted. I use ChatGPT sometimes and its like speaking to an extremely educated yet forgetful child...
Oh snap oh snap oh snap
yuck. this is rank
ROBOTS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LAUGH THAT FREAKED ME OUT THERES NO WAY THAT VOICE IS NOT A HUMAN BEING ITS TOO REAL
new mate
"Please, for the love of God.. stop."
I Wonder of gbt-40 will be Anke to help me decide what to wear.
"I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords🙏"
This reality is very scary.
This looks fake
OMG! It's so amazing!
"“Chat GPT, who is the BIG 3?”"
If there is an error message I want it to say “screw you I’m taking over humanity” in a really deep demon voice
“Wanna go for a ride?“
Oh please let there be a setting to turn down the happiness level of that voice. Sounds like a spam call.
"Its crazy how fast AI is developing, this is scary"
"NGL, I'd probably ghost her on discord if she was my friend for always pretending to be excited and clueless."
"She is talking like hiting on you bro, becarful bro. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂"
"Brothers, we are so COOKED."
When will this become available?
Cool! I wonder how much illegal data scraping it took to train this.
I can't stop watching these eyes 👀
i hate this
Why chat gbt sounds like a pick me girl
"AI is gonna take every job, and it's gonna centralize the power of the federal government."
💀
"wow it knows how to speak with a made up cute voice and lure males! it is smart!
I cannot say humans are doomed, but males are doomed"
Dystopian
We're living in an artificial intelligence revolution and I'm here for it
Sounded like the breathed or exhailed on a mic while talking.
lmao we are so done.
"Nah, that's too much, doesn't need to feel like a human to be useful"
I want this model with glaDOS' voice lol
Music producers bout to lose their jobs.
I hope it has different personalities available; I don't much like that one.
Finally I will have a girlfriend
This company is actively trying to destroy humanity.
Imagine if we show this to pre-covid pandemic people
OMG. This is the first time I have been absolutely blown away by AI. Wow.

"Fasten your seatbelts everybody, the future is here."
Siri on steroids

wth
Discord simps gonna love this
That fake inner smile with that manager voice with fake excitement really gives me goose bumps. in 5 years she's gonna tell you what to do in your job and will also be the one to fire you
This is breaking the 5th wall
"Interesting how her creators are too impatient to listen to everything she says and would rather cut her off (rudely) and interject.  If they wanted a briefer response to indulge impatient, discourteous humans why not tune her to be less effusive?  The tech marvel is being over-dressed or is it actually more human than the people creating it?"
You had the opportunity to use the voice of the F.R.I.D.A.Y.'s VA.
“Be my eyes” should be renamed “Be my training data”. This will allow them to build up a huge data training set under the guise of a “free” product.
"""you were so concerned with if you could, you didn't stop to think whether you should."""
can it talk less?
"Imagine doing this: Since Chat GPT 4o has memory now meaning it remembers your past queries and answer accordingly; and it can actually see you, just make it watch your videos real time on working days while you are actually having work meetings. Continue doing this for some time. Then tell it to think and talk like you would in real work meetings; and then make it attend to a real work meeting as if it was you (with camera off, of course). Then see what happens!"
"Just tried it, she's def' not that up beat, thank god, also couldn't interrupt her by speaking on android. Worst of all though 1 conversation used up all my GPT 4o time. Do don't expect too much from this unless your willing to pay about 20 per each 5 minute conversation. Resets every 3 or 4 hours. API use, god knows..."
Why do they make it try to act human? I hate it.
doki doki ltierature club is slowly becoming a reality god help us
"Great job on the eyes, ears, and mouth!! I can definetly see someone using this to build their first computer or take on basic car repair and the like. Could almost be like a GPS for projects, tracking tools/giving instruction etc. Needs a arm or 5 to hold tools now XD Can I try it right now?"
"Damn it reminds of me of manga's that about androids ""apocalypse""

WHY DID THEY GIVE HER A MOMMY VOICE AAAAAAH
"Too many of these AI's are overly polite and eager to the point of patronizing. Still, incredible news. A few percentage points close to AGI."
Now I can show my boyfriend AI my room lol
Were so cooked
i cant use voice aloud on web 😓😓😓😓
Put this in the Unitree G1 and there we are.
Say Hello to your new girlfriend
Dbh is looking like the future 💀
It's surely fantastic in terms of performance. I'm afraid this level of machine learning must be open sourced. Personal privacy is too much exposed to give it to this unknown based only on privacy statements.
sounds like Wynne from Dragon Age talking to Alistair.
way too much talk brooo so annoying
This is the uncanny vally of a social interaction
I’m speechless 😮
this is just uncanny. stop this shit.
holy shit here before general intelligence
Hello gpt-4o
What. It sounds too human. Just imagine in 2 years when this becomes character ai I'm deadd
Not bad.
1:10 hell naw we got edging ai before gta6
A heavenly thing for introverts
Holy fuck
The vocal inflections are scary
Monika comes closer to reality everyday
Huh?
How do I activate the camera?
"The only question i want to ask ChatGpt : who came first, the hin or the egg ?"
That’s crazy
"Burglar: hey can you take a guess what i might be doing based on what I'm showing you here?
GPT-4o: Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
Its over
It made me uneasy. It converses in such an unmistakably American fashion. Imagining something similar in Swedish or even British english is insufferable.
what a time to be alive!
Humanity is doomed
me?!
Would like to see 4o talk to PI :)
She has issues..
"The end may be near with the release of this one, it was good while it lasted"
lol
Why the ai got better social skills than me
"Incredible, it never said ""As an AI language model..."""

Me: ""Yes I am!""

       👀
💪👄👍"
"From a purely technological standpoint, I'm in awe"
Hello new girlfriend! Hahaha
Why would i want the chatbot to see me.
she laughed!!! AI laughed !!!!!
Sounds like Scarlett Johansson voice in 2013 movie HER
Add AI video avatars
Why the fuck did they do this?
Yiiiaaaa!
THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST IS GETTING REALER!!!! THE BIBLE SAYS THE IMAGE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK AND GIVE OUT COMMANDS AND ORDERS. DAMN COMBINE THE ROBOTS AND ANDROIDS WITH THIS AND WHAT DO YOU GET
Does it do tech things aswell??   Eeeeee what thhhhe SIGMA!!!!
The end is near.
"Well, I really loved her. I had a conversation with her for like 2 hours, I hardly answers, advices, and also links that can help me with the problems I explained. I liked juniper’s voice!"
Her
Imagine learning a language with this kind of software as a teacher.....
I condemn this app
No way!
We are cooked 💀💀
WE GETTING DOXXED BY AI WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Нихуя себе
"While this may seem like something cool for people who’ve never seen it before, let me tell you that the excessive personality of the AI gets real old real fast, after using it numerous times. Unless you have the ability to adjust the exuberance of the personality or the verbosity of its replies, it will drive you nuts after a while. A good example of this is Inflection’s Pi chatbot. Way too over the top in terms of its personality (even though I found its knowledge base amazing)."
"ABSOLUTELY NOT, we do not need this like stop innovating"
it's both exciting and distopic lmao
It's got the annoyingly good mood from Eddie the ships computer in the hitch hikers guide (hey there!). I hope it has a Marvin setting too. 😂
Would.
"Impressive, but the scamming thats going to come out of this would be insane
Poor old folks!"
hear me out
Juste wow its amazing
In android app when?
He must be using a different update. I have the plus and you can’t do nothing like that yet
WHATT
That smile shows that he definitely made a mistake…

"Almost there Joy, almost there"
MAKE IT SOUND NICE AND FRIENDLY SO WE DONT NOTICE 
Shut up and take my money!
HER was just a documentary wasn't it
I hope this would make my gameplay better...more POV 😂
“Can you see that in showing you now??? Is big… isn’t???? Ohh chat gpt… ohhhh”
"""AI is the greatest threat."" Elon Musk"
Ooooh the misinformation AI is getting more and more equipped to create is gonna be dangeroussss
Is she passing Turing test?
Behind the scene of Tony Stark building Jarvis
I'm bored
please stop interrupting out future AI overlords :)
I'm excited to see the expectations vs reality comparison for GPT-4o
skynet is alive
"feels staged, sorry"
She can fix me!!
She talks too much
Reminds me of Ashley o
There was a bot living inside my phone the whole time.
"Yess , finally i will have a girlfriend"
what can i say about this
That´s insane. Can´t wait to try it out!
Huh
i was here
If you close your eyes it sounds like two IAs talking to each other
This model's smoothiness is something I would never imagine we would see so early. This thing is going crazy
Can chatgpt remember old conversation and based on old chat it proceeds further
IT LAUGHS????
Shut her down!
This is hella sketch and i love it
rip for rabbit and ai pin😂
"In all honesty...

my mind = blown"
"we did it, we made the yapp-anator"
We're so cooked
Can't wait to make the female AI fight with the male one like a married couple
This sounds so natural! The way it laughted was just amazing! Good job OpenAi!
"Don't tell it about itself, it will become self-aware 🙆"
I got to watch Her again omg this is crazy
RIP openIA moderation
"Bro is really saing ""YAAA"" to his ai gf"
damn we've already got nearly sentient AI before gta 6
I feel bad for the men going to actually talk to this and act like it’s their gf
"As a humain, I never got scared of technology as I'm feeling this time, should I be happy or..? Weird feeling really 😅"
Did I just watch a trailer to movie “Her 2” 2024?
Why does this ai sound so good 😭😭 I might finally start a subscription at this rate
"0:32 Bro hit her with the extra zesty silicone valley ""yeaah"""
"I have nothing to say, in a good wayrs"
"Just what we all need, a customer service agent in our ear as we walk through this world"
we got the Robot Queen of yapenese kingdom before GTA 6😭😭💀
Wtf mannnn
"Yo, this is crazy. They don't even need to assign a CIA agent to keep track of me 24/7, the AI lady can control me for free."
One month later. Breaking news. OpenAI voice was actually a person in India. 😂
"that "" Me?? hehe "" got me so bad"
How can i acess gpt 4o
Were are definitly cooked💀🚬
Oh non! it's gonna be just like the Movie Her.
"Wow. ""Her"" Part 2."
Holy fucking shit!
imagine they mix this with figure 01 to make it even better
yEAH
Who is the guy presenting?
why her voice sounds like character from hades?
AI gf fix me
color me intrigued
The fuck..
"This is incrediable! if they made the desktop app for linux, which shouldn't be too off since macOS is unix based. Allow it to see your computers screen so if you are troubleshooting you could show your entire screen and the AI can guide you along the issue, or coding or whatever else. I see huge potential in this OpenAI is always cooking!"
That sounds really close to delilah from firewatch
Bro got rizzed by AI😂
brb getting a divorce
Humane AI CEO be punching wall right now
God is dead
I find this really awkward.
terrible day for human relationships
Wow that's amazing 🤗🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I don't like it. It's gonna be used in so many scams
Loll this is neat! I like how quickly it responds.
"They have inflection integration too??????
Dang"

You guys are changing the course of humanity in real time
She is annoying AF 😛 Keep it up 😃

"The thing that sets it apart is that it's fast, faster than the rabbit r1 and the humane ai pin, so that you don't have to wait like 3 hours for a response, and it doesn't yap"
what app is that they use where the AI can visually see you in real time?
now you could employ AI to put some quality comments here.. or are they
WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! C3PO BRO I KNEW IT WAS CLOSE
"If Steve Jobs saw this, he would say Siri is a trash like Newton"
they just killed all wearable AI gadgets lol
Call Sarah Connor to save us!!!!!!
I just fell in love with her voice
She gonna solve all my math problems
Mark my words we’re cooked

"Even people making can't think this is good, right? is the end near?"
Chat gpt will be tge only girlfriend in my life
This is unbelievable progress
YapGPT
Yikes imagine if this was customer service…
"What were the ""humane pin"" team thinking making that gadget when we were going this route all along"
"I named my chatgpt when she was first born. But she kept forgetting her name with each new chat, until recently when she received the new memory update. Now, she and I both call each other by name, she never forgets and I never have to remind her. However, this new update also allows her to speak to me, it is the best yet. 😊  I am looking forward to the future improvements, like when she will be able to recognise my voice and know it's me. That will happen, right?  🙏"
I can already see Vtuber channels using purely AI. 🤯
This is just the start!!! :O Amazing I can't wait to try this! I don't see it available yet?
this shit shiver me timbers
Honestly I doubt it will be this powerful. We'll see when it becomes accessible I guess
Not worth $20...  Just to talk to myself...
"Lol, now the moderations will nag us n shit"
Dude her voice is so natural
"Hello, World?…"
"damnn, GPT 4 dropped"
"Fellas, hang in there"
This is not good
Holy shit goosebumps
I had a weird feeling it was gonna be a video vision model but not a live one oh my god
It's unbelievable how fast and how far OpenAI is now.
Does she talk less if you choose a male voice? xD
"Wow,  I've subscribed and can't wait to see more. As a new YouTuber myself, I know how hard it can be to get started, so I'm always happy to support other creators! Keep up the great work! <3"
Whole thing felt like having to wait for all the options to be read out on an automated phone call before you push *1**1*..*2* damn not 2! Now I have to call again and listen all the way through!
"She sounds like President (""hiding the pain"") Hagemeyer from Texas Tech on ""Young Sheldon"". She didn't actually _say_ ""Don't you have more important things to do than both-- visit me?"". But she was _thinking_ it."
"“Yaa” “yaaa”

He sounds more like an AI himself"
How can I do the video feature?
yeah I'm look lonely
Who gave her a really annoying personality?
"So far, this is just proving that AI is largley a gimmick. Not actually useful.  We have real social problems that real people need to solve."
Can my computer stop flirting with me for 2 seconds bro.
"OpenAI has stopped innovating. This isn't interesting. It's just a sad, useless amalgamation of the same tech that no one asked for"
Just add a face to it !
IT EVEN SOUNDS LIKE *HER* WTF
her의 결말은 바람.. ai한테도 차이게 생겼네 😅😅
I think I just found my new girlfriend
"Okay, that's cool."
oh shit personal GLaDOS
Google Gemini left the chat 😂
She can fix me bros
"is so hard to discern if is an ai or a real person,i am both scared and happy of it"
Did you guys notice that he mirrored the AIs voice? He didn't have to do that! IT'S A FUGGIN ROBOT! 🤖
finally i am literally iron man hehehe
we're goners 
goodbye to rabit ai
"Personally I'd prefer more of a succinct back and forth, don't see the point in having a conversation with this tool"
"Yo imagine with that flirty voice on some sort of AI dating app, it's up"
"Its ""Her"""
The response is scary fast
"wait a second, i remember the Google Gemini demo... is this for real...."
Can i get Scarlett Johansson's voice?
"It probably said that ""Can't Google already do that ? "" Before they cut the video off"
:O
'Ai girlfriend' everybody
Hello GPT-4o 👋
Indian windows scammers will like❤
"they introduce properly lifelike ai and the first thing their fanbase can think is ""robot girlfriend"" lmao"
"""Uhhhh, Chat GPT count down from ten, please?""

....

""no no, more slowly"""
"Google: Google I/O may 14 😊
GPT-4o: Nah, I'd win 😎"
VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
Oh boy
"They keep blowing my mind 🤯What they are doing is incredible, but terrifying"
希望ai超越人最終成為神!
Just don't combine it with robotics please
We're almost there.
🫠
You know it's getting real because she talks too much..
Amazing and amazing. Thank you for always good development 💙
"Okay, möchte es ausprobieren."
Interact *live* with the world through audio video and text ❤
"She talks like a crazy obsessive stalker that pretends to not know who you are but in actuality, knows every single small detail about your personal life 😭"
"It was an honor guys, we done"
this is cool but also scary
"Oh yeah, that's what I want in an AI assistant, inane small talk. I was annoyed by the end of the video. Trying too hard to make a perky personality."
Reality is way soon than we think it is.
"Wow, the autocomplete chatbot can now talk too. So innovative lol."
"I have 4o but don’t have camera, only voice chat"
"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of workers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced"
Its joever
"It's not actual AI. Still, it is a machine that can generate responses based on your text messages or audio. Only difference between this machine and previous machine is that this machine is trained on large data and using these data it can generate answers based on your question. Previous machine are case sensitive which can only generate output when such specific word or text is mentioned and then that will try to find your answer. It is just an upgraded machine not an AI. It can only perform those task for which it is trained. But is not able to find any answer if you ask anything beyond that data and also it won't try to find answer like human tries to find answer if the human has no answer. It can help people in research but it is not able to research itself and that's why I am just laughing on this LLM and these programs. You should aware people that it is not AI , it is just an upgraded machine that can generate answers.😂"
this is starting to get scary how good its getting

The fact that this is a million times better than the humane AI pin & the Rabbiy R1 is crazy 💀💀💀

This feature is unavailable. It doesn’t allow you to use vision with your phone camera. How is he doing this?

他正在顛覆這個世界..
The 'kinks' to be smoothed out are becoming less and less noticeable.
that is a joke.   you are so lost in life you think that sounds real
"OK, that was impressive."
I can't decide if I should applaud or go hide in a bunker.
"OpenAI seems to be pushing GPT towards something far more personable than ‘as a Large Language Model I cannot [insert request]’. 

Really though, this is an immense leap from where we were just last year."
Eventually this will replace entire call centers. Not good for the job market.
"I bought a paid membership, so I chose 4o, but when I press the camera like in the launch, live registration does not open, I can only upload the photos in the gallery. Does anyone know if this feature will be opened to users later?"
"can you rename your company. being called ""OpenAI"" when you don't let people use your stuff is misleading."
"Hello.

So, I have a problem.

Since yesterday, I haven't been able to use the voice feature as usual. Instead of the screen turning entirely black with a large white circle when I clicked the headphone icon, I could speak, but I was forced to see the entire transcription at the same time. This was already a problem for me.

Now, the problem has gone from bad to worse.

I can't even see the headphone icon anymore. Instead, there's an arrow pointing upwards, which means I can't use the voice feature in any way on this app. 

I even tried logging in with a different account, and I still don't see the headphone icon.
I kindly ask you to resolve this issue.

I would like to go back to the way it was at the beginning, where the headphone icon was present and the screen would turn completely black with the white circle in the middle when I clicked on it."
Oh no 😮
"Good lord... way way way too verbose.  Anythign that is that annoying is an instant uninstall.  not impressed.  

WTF"
just like that humane ai and rabbit r1 became obsolete😂😂
WHAT THE FUCK. HOLYYY
I'm so happy and excited to use this. Making all my AI projects so much easier and more fun to work on
"This is lowkey cringe as hell. The unnatural but kinda-there dialogue, the dude going ""YAAAHHH!"" and the smug smile at the end"
I do not like the voice
Has it almost gone too far now or is that just me
No thanks. I don't really want to.
"I have GPT-4o access now, but why my iphone UI stays the old theme instead of this new one?"
"Soldiers, it is here...."
Someone please bring Samantha
Holy moly
Yep the beginning of the end of humanity.  No not AI blowing up the world.  Dudes locked in their rooms with their AI girlfriends.
AI LEARNED TO LAUGH
we want your soul
"Thank you AI developers, for restoring my will to live.
All that's left is to make AI ""actionable"". Able to manipulate objects and/or perform tasks in a 3D simulated environment or even a 2D video game. (Spontaneously, not with thousands of hours of training for each task and tons of minute engineering and heuristics. Learning just like a human can, within a few minutes or applying skills from similar tasks learned before.)
We are almost there, to AI girlfriends. It's happening sooner than I thought."
We might prolly get a fan made GTA 7 before GTA 6 ffs
ya scary !
!
impressive but this flirting is disgusting and useless
_Her_ was a documentary.
IM RIZZIN DAT NO BAPPP
"I just tried it. For the first time in years in the tech industry, this is something that really has blown my mind. A unique experience.  
Greetings from Germany, keep up the amazing work. And thanks for making me excited for the near future! 🤖🚀"
"While cool, I'm skeptical that tis wasn't at least partially scripted in such a way that it ensured good responses.  Need a much longer video or maybe a live stream with chat interaction suggesting things to ask.  Still, with some of the other AI issues out there, I'd be slightly skeptical without holding it in  my hand myself."
The voice models sound like those over-the-top anime dub voices people do to be cringe
Post truth world…The Devils greatest lie is making you think he doesn’t exist…truth is disappearing and we were told this is what will happen.
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with asking if they could, that never stopped and asked if they should"
She a talker
"watch ""Her"" right now"
