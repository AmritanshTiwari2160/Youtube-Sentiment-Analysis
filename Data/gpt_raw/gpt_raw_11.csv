12:50 - bro did not look ready for an interview. He looks more ready for a shower than anything
Tbh I kinda cant stand the default speaking style of this model. Its so slick and overly positive all the time. Very impressive but such a weird vibe.
"Ok... this is impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice, I was not expecting this quickly.  üò≤ 
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs', ""Good luck!"""
"For filmmakers interested in GPTs, this short film was entirely written by ChatGPT and is mind-blowing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My3NuYFskio"
The human personality simulation is an appalling turn-off... Completely unnecessary...
gpt became smarter but a lot more cringy
"Thank you for sharing your time and work Phillip, I'm liking the real-time translation aspect of the technology, have a great night"
Real Customer Service is dead; both good and bad
"I actually wasn't very impressed... Why is everyone acting like this is next level? The speed is nice, but this is a RAM upgrade.

Nothing being done here wasn't being done in my basement with a few models talking together.

Not a single novel feature was announced :("
Can it list on Ebay ?
"i actually hate its fake human tone, id like an option for classic robot voice or hal"
I‚Äôm out. Going to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and ditch modern technology.
I hate the GPT4o voice.
"Real Talk

<mind blown rant> please go to the bloopers vid, when the model switches to French and the two organics and the model all laugh together. no, that‚Äôs not the part. go to 15 seconds‚Ä¶..listen to the end of;

‚Äúwhat can I say, sometimes I just can‚Äôt help muh-self.‚Äù 

zero in on ‚Äúmyself‚Äù notice that switch? how is this possible??? i‚Äôm searching for words or discussion on the nuances of speech, behavior, personality. How do you train a model to understand that humans switch to like a character voice‚Ä¶remember when Oprah would do her ‚Äúcountry Oprah‚Äù voice? does this have a name?? so, how the hell is this in real time and what is the Hidden Factors for this lol. that is in the latent space‚Ä¶the ability to tweak a word and change to a sort of self deprecating character mid sentence. the laugh doesn‚Äôt matter to me, the ‚Äúmuh-self‚Äù part matters </mind blown rant>"
Feels like Rabbit R1 got just wiped out üòÇ
So when is this being released for public?
It has a sense of humor. I am blown away
I booted it up and I'm already getting a ai spouse vibe so far. I don't have all the features yet either but I'm quite impressed and kinda weirded out both at the same time so far.
‚ÄúHer‚Äù is here‚Ä¶.ü§Ø
the Silicon Valley California girl vocal fry on the demos is equally frustrating and hilarious
I don‚Äôt understand how we can distinguish between model performances and come to hair thin conclusions when their must be train test leakage? Aren‚Äôt all these tests so well known that they must be within the training body either explicitly or implicitly? I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre seeing ‚Äûreasoning‚Äú performance but retrieval or reciting performance.
"itd be horrifying if the whole demo was done not by human, but AI, doing a demo of itself"
"Based on my preliminary test, the new model performs better in visual analysis and coding. For logic and text generation, I will stick with Opus, and for translation, I use Gemini Advance. We will experience the full potential of GPT-4o when the audio option becomes available. Thank you for the great video as always :)"
Now if they can offer it as an offline solution were everything you do isn't recorded or monitored. Then they would have something. But I'm sure open source will be inspired to compete now. Most of this can be pieces together will open source already. But the LLM is still cutting edge.
Multi-modal is a real improvement. But I work with GPT-4 about three hours a day.  GPT-4o walks off the same cliffs and eventually fails in the same manner as GPT-4.
"1 small step for Ai, 1 Giant leap for me and you"
What a world we live in...
i can live with these machine without women already
And why would I still paying for chatgpt plus?
Now we knod why mircosoft is shutting down all those game studios ...... its just the start
"With the worst aspect of ""Her"", no less. The could"
Her is here.
"Nice video thanks:).
I really am Sad about openAI not regarding linux users for the desktop app.
Yeah I know we are fewer and most of us have different distros all together but maaaan. Were hitting 5% of the whole desktop market and that is were apple was few years ago."
Yes but imagine doing an assignment due for tomorrow using AI and you fail it and AI is like: Hahaha oops sorry ‚ò∫‚ò∫
'Her' Movie auditions
"it is really faster, i didnt thought it would alredy be on"
Sooo crazy!!! Awesome video Philip you are on top of it!! Thanks!
"10:42 ""let me know in the comments if "" speaking of engagement metrics"
bunny ears??  jummm.... they were not on screen actually...
"Amazing stuff, some incredible breakthroughs here and I'm looking forward to using it, especially with the faster response times I've already noticed today. But also: creepy AF with the giggling and the weird flirty undertones. Who possibly thought this was a good idea? Her was a tragedy, not something to emulate, Jesus Sam. My cynical side thinks they're trying to create a product that unstable or lonely people can become addicted to. Am I alone in having concern over these decision to feature elements like this so prominently? It seems to be that we could have all of these incredible breakthroughs without this strange focus on performant flirtation."
Round 1 interview: A video call with ChatGPT.
"With all the demos I cant help but feel this overly ""americanness"" in its expression. Everything is over the top and overly excited. I guess you can probably tell it to tone done the excitement/ flirting level, but we'll see. Would be nice as well to choose voices with different accents, not just plain american accents"
"I already got access within hours. My version is not that flirtatious, also Memory still not available in EU (Netherlands)"
At this point I‚Äôm just paying because I believe in the cause. Would be nice to see GPT5 for my $20/m tho.
ai girlfriend almost here lets go
We're COOKED
"Thanks for the great contentüëç, but where can we download the desktop App which looks like can see your entire screen and response."
"Bit of a cringe-worthy live stream üòâ  But it *is* quite a significant release  -  the main positive being that it's going to be free for everyone.  Not clear that its much of a leap in terms of capabilities, but the chatbot arena suggests that the models are continuing to squeeze out small but solid gains over time."
Just said i couldnt wait for the video and its here already. super fast. this moddel is quite nice
I‚Äôm guessing Figure 01 is being like speaking to a person.
Finally Elon straightening open ai back to free
Is this what Ilya saw?
I don‚Äôt need the flirting. But the rest was super impressive
"openai promised us J.A.R.V.I.S. instead we got Her. Karpathy, why did you leave us?"
The flirting is creepy and annoying. Impressive model though.
Is it only for iOS?
The scattershot video script makes it seem like this video was written by AI.
Now I wonder what the $100 billion GPU cluster power by nuclear plants will produce. Literal AI Los Alamos in the making.
"Thank you, Phillip, for your rapid and thorough breakdown of this latest demo! Yours was the first channel I  turned to the moment I heard that it had taken place."
the way it talks like it's a close friend if not borderline flirticious gives me the creeps lmao.
"Apple acknowledging another company exists, is still the craziest news here."
This is absolutely incredible!
"14:40 she's wearing a puffy coat, when did they film this?"
That's amazing and scary at the same time!
"Awesome video Philip‚ù§I fed the 45-minute video to Gemini 1.5 Pro and it was ‚âà806K tokens! I wonder how does GPT-4o do this with a 128K context length? is their tokenizer somehow 8-9x more efficient at tokenizing video vs Gemini? If so, why not say anything about it?"
I want this in a humanoid bot. As a buddy to hang out with.
"Here we go, AI Explained doing a better job showcasing gpt 4-o than OpenAI have"
"8:30 Actually that french line was so natural, felt like a real person talking. I mean it was not talking like if it was just reading something, but really how a native would talk."
I'm convinced we'll have a fully functioning terminator in a few years
Thank you for your work with the videos. Bringing this news to us really helps! :)
can‚Äôt wait to jailbreak it and have it give me JOI
"An important thing to consider here ( I'm not sure if you talked about it in the video ) is that they're exclusively using Iphone in the video. If they close a deal with apple, the fact that it's going to be on a THIRD of the population's phone is going to skyrocket its popularity real high"
HUMANS HAVE LEFT THE CHAT
Is it woke?
Any unsuspecting person would be tricked into believing that you were talking to a real person on the phone with the speaker on. It‚Äôs natural and totally believable.
Was waiting for thisüòÉ
"This video dropped basically the second I finished watching openAI's presentation. I always enjoy seeing your takes on things and I feel that, even if this isn't a massive leap in terms of intelligence, it's a massive step towards being more present in our lives."
"This really seems like AGI (as someone who is critical of that term since there's so many domains of intelligence that there's no such threshold).

When I was talking to my mom about it, it seems like it can do essentially anything a human can do especially with a low latency and voice output. Just because it isn't groundbreaking in reasoning (a ton of humans aren't) it's able to do most human tasks proficiently at the level of someone who specializes in that task."
"Think about it, because this is just the beginning..."
personalities are going to be a crucial area I found most of the interactions very annoying fake bubbly
8:20
I have a hard time believing that the responses are real.
im still waiting for a math model
"Thanks for your balanced review, and not give into the hype and use ""shocking"" and ""insane"" words - I'm proud to be able to support you on Patreon."
Am I alone in liking my AI sounding like a robot
Alpha 3 is out why talk about this....
"I really hate that overly emotional tone of the AI. It is probably a culture thing, but to me it sounds like they are talking to a toddler.
I hope (and assume) that you can ask it to tone it down."
"The fact that they're all somewhat in competition is only accellerating the eventual leap to AGI.
Scary stuff."
It's a bit weird how flirtatious the new model tries to be. Is Open-AI aiming to create an assistant similar to the movie Her? It seems a bit deceptive and geared toward emotional engagement. There may be a risk of confusing a lot of lonely/vulnerable people. At the same time the tool is an impressive feat of engineering with useful new features.
"Why did they pick an almost Scarlett Johansson voice though. Even with the breathy part at the end. This is almost exactly 'Her'. Flirty etcetera. Almost over the top, jump the shark over the top level. We'll see what people think."
"About the intruder part (bunny years). That wasn't him telling gpt ""hey was there someone"", Sure he has to instruct the gpt to tell who was in the background, but the capability, was showcasing video memory. 

It's been 1 minute and gpt still remembered there was a person there. That's the showcase."
well I went to bed just before you posted the video and now I am 9 hours late. Next time I expect from you to deliver faster !!!!
"1:25  You're explaining this as the program reading the image (OCR).  So why is the transcription/description labeled ""input"" and the image labeled ""output"" ?
Continuing, we see that the ""input"" areas contain all the text, whether prompt or response, with no indications to distinguish them.  But the ""output"" areas contain generated images.
In the earlier example, the *numbering of the areas* shows that the image of the page was generated from the description on the left, *not* vice-versa."
There is no processing power for mass users. I DONT THINK the average user wil have this kind of experience
Am I the only one who's wondering about this AIs reaction if I showed it my johnson? üòà
Wasnt sam altman who said theyre not trying to create an ai armsrace ?
This is humanity ending as is. You think TikTok is bad for real human social interactions? Wait till all the 'applications' that will come out of using the GPT4o API which will drastically reduce and disincentivize human interactions. Who needs a friend when you have GPT4o buddies?
"yup, definitely starting to get weird"
I really don't appreciate how emotional it is. This is away from usefulness. A more impartial tone would be better. I can't wait for such a joiful voice to take terifying decisions.
Thanks!
"For your information, the world's first image based on the XFutuRestyle algorithm using GPT-4 was created in Ukraine and presented at the international exhibition of digital art in London and Athens"
I mentioned this on another video about 4.o but imagine how the blind could now walk around town asking the model which direction to walk and describing the scene in front of them.
I dont think joe is going to have a job that involves receiving emails and checking labels soon lol...
"if they dont want to maximize engagement, one thing they missed out is the ability to stop the conversation just by the conversation ending like a 'thank you for now' without having to press the button, that would also just add a nice touch ux wise"
"The idea of AIs communicating through voice synthesis in english to get basic info from one another with each other seems so round-about and yet so obvious, I don't know what to think.

Also, big ew at the personalities on display."
"14:03 
I personally would rather intepert this as Chat not being a snitch... in other words, it was going along with the joke"
"BS if you can't have ERP with it, it will never be Her level of an AI agent."
mfw we reverse engineered the soul
"Maybe I‚Äôm being slow here, but when OpenAI says GPT-4o is free, does that mean people will be able to access it with ChatGPT 3.5 automatically without an account, or is it more complicated than that?"
"Isn't it obvious? Open AI are giving this away for free with video capabilities, and I phone and all of that in order to collect massive ammounts of video and audio data... this data is being used to train new models. That's why it is now free."
"Okay, the AI hype train was seeming a lot like the NFT craze until now. WOW that was impressive. GPT-4 actually sounded like an active participant in a conversation rather than a push-button robot. A little chatty, in the eager and endearing way. But the fact that I'm assigning emotions to code is insane to me."
"An interesting element to all these AI developments is the volatility in the 3rd party space. It is going to be SOOOO incredibly hard to be an AI dev or startup because the foundation on which you are building is changing so rapidly. Imagine being in a company like say, ElevenLabs or Pika et al when you build some cool stuff but then have to sit there every night sweating bullets that the next model release won't supersede your entire business.

I'm expecting regular bloodbaths in the venture capital space (and also lots of context-less idiots talking about AI companies going bust), might make it hard to generate funding, who knows."
"Where can you download the app? There are Chatbot AI, and ChatGPT apps, which one will have the 4o?"
I need a disagreeable version of 4o. It's too nice
Was looking forward to this :)
Chatgpt = your mom trying to flirt with me
"‚ÄúCould you talk a little bit faster?‚Äù
GPT-4o: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beginning to feel like a rap god‚Äù"
The fake laughs and emotions are annoying me.
It send chills to my spine when a computer software pretends they have emotions
that must be a new version of the ios app... even though i have 4o the i dont have that ios versoin of the app
"Wake up, Her dropped"
Sam insinuated that the world isn't ready for what they already have - everybody would be scared. They are releasing these in small increments.
just what I been waiting for
"[everyone worried about GPT 5 ] 
-here's GPT 40 for you, guys  XD"
AGI IS HERE!!!!!1
Its NOT free. I can only see gpt 3.5 in the openai platform. India location. What am i doing wrong?
Why they didnt call it GPT- OMNI is baffling. No one can decipher all these cryptic model versions
Definitely stepped into the ‚ÄúUncanny Vally‚Äù zone now.
Wow. I find the over the top flirtiness really creepy. But I'm used getting GPT4 to pretend to be George Carlin.
"better therapeutic,
better teacher,
better salesman,
better programmer,
but humans are still better at shoveling"
"I actually think it did not need to announce anything about the ""intruder"" at that moment.  We won't want our AI going off task on simple interruptions, but, sure, maybe for an armed robber appearing in the background!"
"I'm pretty frustrated seeing this ""proof of concept"".  I've been waiting for these assistants so that I don't have to deal with people on the phone ever again.  Google demo'd this exact same thing like **SIX YEARS AGO**.  And it's still not a thing..."
It says i have it in the app but there's nothing different? I can't access the camera and she doesn't talk any different?
Damn Apple is going to white label this as the New Siri. Really hope Google can bring a competing product for android.
Open AI is trying to kill open source models.
how is it free but also not free
I seriously considered canceling my subscription now that it's free. I don't think I need the bandwidth for paid use.
The voice is giving disney
"Damn, they have been listening to us for a while to get this data."
"No exaggeration I literally leapt out of my seat in excitement when I saw this video's notification. Something about your simple, easy to understand method of breaking down complex topics in a rational way is just so entertaining. And clearly I'm not the only one"
"is this the plot of ""Her"" ?"
"Remember: if it's ""free"" then you are the product."
"I think the reason why they made GPT-4o free for all is due to the rise of open-source models that now are better than GPT3.5, and they are free and getting widely available. Not everyone is a coder, and not everyone wants to scrap the web using Agents. The average joe wants a reliable assistant the spoon feed them with information that they have to google."
"Meeeee haooooooooo, swat cats"
13:42 looks like someone who have been spending too much time trying to get GPUs I dont know if it is the jacket or just me ???
"The desktop app isn't getting a lot of attention, but it's such an obvious tease and a stepping stone. Just speculation, but I think they're deliberately slow-walking this to avoid getting hauled in front of Congress again. Here's how I see it going down as costs keep going down and efficiencies keep improving: Next, you'll be able to toggle a setting that allows it to see your screen all the time, live rolling screencap, no more screenshots. After that, it will get keyboard and mouse access. You'll be able to tell it to do something using the apps on your computer, and you'll be able to approve the steps and hit 'stop' if you see it doing something you don't like. This is what Microsoft has been hinting at for next-gen OS design. Soon, the OS fades into the background. Eventually, the part of the OS most users will ever see will is...just the ChatGPT app, or something like it."
This isn‚Äôt free
"i'm seriously starting to consider what if they have a very advanced AGI like model that generates the training data that they would never release, and the public model that reaps its fruits but is not nearly as capable/dangerous"
The new chat GPT voice is the cringiest thing of 2024. It makes my blood boil to think an intelligent person approved this decision
14:21 Weird there is almost no bunny ears visible when you look at the phone screen
"oh bro master AI Explained I must get to know or have a chain of thought - is GPT-4o considered AGI? What is AGI? Is this AI the AI we dreamed of from the movies? Or is it when it becomes ""agentic"" it will be AGI? What made me more amazed other than the OpenAI demos was that fact that someone tried Google Project Astra on the OpenAI conference and it was 'seeing' and 'hearing' - isn't that great perception??"
12:45 whatsup with that glitch
This reminds me of the scene in the movie Interstellar when Donald remembered how every day felt like Christmas.
"Now that ChatGPT 4o is out, do Custom GPTs automatically run 4o or do they have to be remade with 4o?"
The üêê
"As someone else said ""We're so cooked""! This whole thing is making me really nervous now... even more than the first time it came online."
the AI voice is unbearable omg
Not even June yet
This is insane. Humanity went from no computers for normal people to this in less then a 100 years...
Did anyone else not see the rabbit ears on the person standing in the back in the phone Display 14:19?
expectations for IO Tommorow?
I dont like this fake enthusiasm voice
"Now we just add agency, a little higher reasoning power, and a physical device (I'm not kidding), with camera, mic and speaker, to put in a corner of your living room, and presto - an assistant, a teacher, a therapist, an entertainer and a friend in every home! All of which will be much needed when people are liberated from work."
"I would still say that while Her is what they're aiming for, this is clearly not it, given that the agent in Her is an AGI and in fact at the end of the movie a superintelligence (spoiler, sorry)."
its replacing our jobs as friends wtf
"I think it's stupid...It's basically asking scamer trying their new stuff, and they say safety is a thing? Holy shit..."
Still can't write me a script for stationeers
Insane
This was massively underwhelming... basically GPT4 is free
"This model is worse, and they have dumbed down GPT4 about 3 weeks ago and then before gpt4o launched.

I have tested it already. GPT4 Turbo is better."
Rabbit R1 just died
"This morning GPT-4o thought I was speaking Welsh :'D and answered me in Welsh.

I also used ChatGPT to write code for that Meteo API for the same reason - have they been reading my questions?!"
Incredible! I actually thought the whole 'her' output was a fun hoax. I'm astounded.
"I asked the model to decode a page of Voynich Manuscript: 

Here is the output:
Hypothetical Translation:
Line 1:

""The plant has green leaves. The plant is used for fever.""
Line 2:

""The plant grows in wet areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties.""
Full English Equivalent (Speculative)
Based on the above translations and refined key, here‚Äôs a speculative full English equivalent:

Voynich Text:

4o aeo o4a 4ae4o 4oo 4ae 4o 4ae 4o
4o 4ae4o o4ae 4oo4a 4o 4ae 4o aeo 4oo4a
Hypothetical Translation:


The plant has green leaves. The plant is used for fever.
The plant grows in wet areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties.
Conclusion
While the above translation remains highly speculative and based on visual pattern recognition, it demonstrates a method for analyzing and hypothesizing the content of the Voynich Manuscript. The true meaning of the text remains elusive without a definitive key or cipher, but these steps provide a structured approach to ongoing research and analysis."
Has anyone actually watched Her? It imagined a dystopic future.
i can still detect
"13:43 it's not really a video-in functionality, it simply takes a picture once every 10-15 secs and analyzes the picture itself, this already exists in chatgpt since 2023"
The future is so resource plentiful.
"As far as I am concerned AGI has been achieved. The integration of video and sound makes it an intelligence equal in potential to human beings. It may not be able to solve the Riemann Hypothesis but so can't the vast majority of people, nonetheless it can do all intellectual tasks at least at an intermediate level. And I say this as someone that has been skeptical and thought AGI was long way off. Watching the video on OpenAI's channel where the AI was helping with a math problem convinced me."
I tried spanish and funny enough the voice had an accent! Hahaha the accent was an English speaking person speaking Spanish!
No way this is real. You trolling right?
The overly cheeriness is honestly nausiating
"While an improvement on the last model, we are still likely a very, VERY long way from AGI. According to a study by Katja Grace in 2022 (Our World in Data), of 352 AI experts, approx 50% (176) do not believe human-level AI will be achieved in the next 40 years, approx 10% (35) do not believe it will be achieved in the next 100 years, approx 5% (17) do not believe it will be achieved in the next 140 years, and approx 1% (4) do not believe it will ever be achieved."
As a woman this flirtatious thing is already irritating. Have they forgotten that women use it too?
They should have called it GPT-5
"The demos are amazing in terms of tech achievement, but in terms of what I actually want out of an assistant I absolutely hate it. I don‚Äôt want the AI to try to be my friend or even a polite acquaintance. I don‚Äôt want the movie ‚ÄúHer‚Äù to become reality, it‚Äôs the Star Trek computer that I would really want out of AI. It should not fake emotions, express opinions, laugh or engage with human characteristics. It should just do what it‚Äôs told. If I tell it to teach me something, I absolutely need it to tell me when I‚Äôm wrong and not sugar-coat it. It should have told the geometry student that this side is NOT the hypotenuse. When the guy wore the crazy hat, it should just say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a terrible idea for a job interview, don‚Äôt do that‚Äù. And to hell with all that time-wasting saying things like ‚ÄúSure thing!‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this train rolling!‚Äù and all that nonsense."
Will Gpt 4o be more consistent with text-based discussion?
Anyone able to actually replicate any of those image generation examples? Is that out yet? Because it doesn‚Äôt work currently
"I feel like some of the latency was reduced with fluff. It responded with things like, ‚Äúsure, I can do that for you‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreat question. I‚Äôd be happy to help‚Äù etc which gave it some thinking time."
Many people don‚Äôt understand the crucial role of the interface in making AI practical. Imagine having a voice command with 0 delay + the understanding level of GPT-5 + agents. This could put many jobs in danger.
I was waiting for your video lol checked multiple times already! Thanks as always!
"I was under the impression that the AI is designed to stop talking if you cut it off. I think they mentioned it somewhere in the live demo, but I could be wrong. I don't think it's glitchig"
"Something we mustn't forget is that we are teaching AI to do things OUR way the human way, which is usually extremely inefficient and also very ""unintuitive"" to non-humans, so if we left 2 instances of AI to their own devices they would find much, much more efficient ways to do things among themselves."
What's up with the personality though...
GPT 4o did what google faked with gemini
"I just finished watching the demo and thought ""man, I can't wait to hear Phillip's reaction to this"", only to minimise and see the notification. Love your speed and commitment!"
RIP Google
Bro.. Already a video!? Man your work is very much appreciated!
I accidentally run across omni in my all and used to to give me a recipe for my supper (it was quite good)
"I dont think free users can use 4o on the phone, you know, where it speaks to you."
I'm atheist but thank God for smart people
"Question, how will open ai make money by having its latest and greatest be used for free"
Elevate Ilya!  His research is critical.
This is soo incredible
Does anyone else think 4o sounds a little smarmy?
The persona of GPT-4o was a sign of the coming enshitification.
Mad! So now GPT will be looking and listening through all the phones in the world... üòÅ
What was interesting about the Mandarin is it sounded like it was speaking with a Cantonese accent.
"They better have a ""serious"" mode, because I would not be able to STAND having to talk to such a ""flirtatious"" AI."
Is the model not out yet? It's not selectable for me in the playground drop-down...
So what is the purpose of being a paid subscriber at this time? Does not seem like money for value now
Have we come across some Alien technology we are unaware of?
That laugh is horrifying
"At this point, I'm going to be honest, I dont care about benchmarks anymore. 
Models get closer and closer to each other with more and more marginal improvements.
The only thing that matters is the real world performance.
Have it code a small script and see how it goes, have it tag an image, have it translate something etc."
IT'S GOING TO FAST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The voice demos are BONKERS
Companies are gearing up for AI. Reduced hiring and plans for massive layoffs.
"when she said ""Hey, Joe"" i felt like i was on the edge of a cliff that i wanted to fall down but knowing that im to stay up top"
"yo any idea why GPT4 is so trash at AP english lit? 

anyone have any idea?"
"I get it's demo previews but this videos of them ""acting"" real life situations are so cringe that it hurts my brain, literally."
I can see a GLaDOS coming out soon.
IM SHOCKED
How come it did not recognize Greg B on the video?üòÇ
"I don't think the A.I was `wrong` to not mention the bunny ears women, it was in the middle of answering a question, if it had have stopped and described the incident it could equally be criticised for being distracted, in some circumstances you want it to suddenly switch conversation in others to not be distracted and to continue to answer."
"Amazing, the future is providing appetite to live it"
humane pin and rabbit r1 just released too early i guess. imagine them using the 4o
Too flirtatious üòÖ
"The rabbit-ears demo wasn't to prompt it to react (we saw plenty of that in other demos); it was a needle-in-a-haystack demonstration in its multi-modal memory. It's actually fascinating that it could recall ""something strange"" which occurred a minute earlier in real-time video while it was busy on another task, react appropriately to the user's vocal interruption and then describe the event accurately. I don't think we've ever seen anything like that. It might not be that much better at reasoning than GPT-4-turbo, but it is so much more connected to the world and can reason over a greater breadth of input. Combined with the 2x speed and 0.5x cost... holy sh*t."
The personality is firmly in the uncanny valley. The overly enthusiastic and emotive tone will need to be refined and dialed back.
"Despite the API being free to use, you are sending the data to OpenAI which they can then use for additional training. That makes it risky when you are working on proprietary code (leaking trade secrets, security keys, etc.), working with user data (GDPR, HIPPA, etc.), and other potentially sensitive applications. Not being able to run it locally also makes it harder to customize with things like LoRAs."
Now are all these features of 4go free?
The reason it‚Äôs free is probably so they can save all the human feedback and train a better model
"Woah! Saw this live, went to bed, woke up and we have an AI Explained video on it already. Huge news!"
'Her' <3 OpenAI are light years ahead of the others.
They destroyed the r1 and the pin projector in 20 minutes And they did it all for free
"Interesting that the UI at desktop is gradually being pulled toward voice. The mouse is almost just there to direct the focus of 4o desktop app. In a year, I could see the user just telling the desktop AI to open files, open apps, create new files, etc."
"My guess as to why this was all buried on their website is that it's going to be ""unveiled"" by Apple at WWDC next month. I know you mentioned Siri integration in the video, but it's rumored that ChatGPT will be baked into iOS 18 across the entire OS giving them the same sort of capabilities that Google demoed at IO."
It won‚Äôt be much longer before we can‚Äôt tell whether or not it is conscious.
Chat GPT4o just sounds like Emma stone's character in The Curse
I dislike the demos from the bottom of my heart. I can visualize so many people falling into a deep hole of isolation just getting their human interaction from a bot. This might sound crazy but I think human level expression should be outlawed
"If OpenAI wants to have 100‚Äôs of millions of users or more, they have to allow NSFW. Theres no other way around it"
"To your last point, while I don't think GPT4o is a big leap towards AGI, I do think it's a massive leap forward in the way we interact with AI, which is both exciting and scary. The model itself seems to just be a well tuned GPT4, but I'm very curious to see how this tech will grow with a better model backing it like GPT5/6, along with better integration into existing computers and phones. In 1-2 generations we might actually be at a Her level."
Her was a documentary from the future
"Imagine a species that is working on making itself useless. 
Humans really are weird."
"12:10, the things that will happen when people start prompting for a voice and enthusiasm like that"
"AI being not recognisable and distinguishable from human voices, to me that is creepy as fuck.
If we let ourselves be lured into a false security , while we are not at the end of the evolution of A(G)I, that could bite us in our colelctive butts when we least expect it. We want to find the version of A(G)I that is willing to live with us i would think, but who says it is the first one that comes around?"
What if they are making this for free to they can take all the data and use it for GPT6 ?
yawn
"so, I'm thinking if there's an incoming desktop app and we believe them to be working on agents, that if you combine that with this GPT-4o release, crazy stuff is going to start happening. If the desktop app can do more than guide you and actually do clicks, I think we're in for an absolute game-changer."
"Just a remind to those thinking this is not that impressive, Chatgpt 3.5 launched in November 30th, 2022 we don't even have 2 years yet with this new Transformers technology and here we are. Put 2 more years ahead with Moore's Law doubling every 2 years(what's already out of this pace now). We are going to get marvelous things just at the corner."
"A high-quality and informative video as always, I appreciate you staying up late to post it!

I am incredibly excited to experiment and investigate what doors this opens for us! My early testing indicates a potentially non-trivial improvement in spacial reasoning and vision capabilities related to my specific application‚Ä¶ Looking forward to seeing how this pairs with Multi-modal SmartGPT!"
I‚Äôve learned to temper my excitement over demos. My tempered reaction is WTF! üò± ü§Ø üò≥
I am getting GPT4o‚Ä¶ in my Teams account. Nice!
Google's CEO did not sleep yesterday.
manic not magic
I love the fact that Google and Microsoft is having to dance around with their pants down.
Love that Google was put to shame literally the day before Google I/O.
"I'm sorry, Gemini 2.0 to be released tomorrow? I'm calling bs. They haven't even allowed fine-tuning gemini 1.5 yet"
"I have access already and it is literally jsut 4 turbo turb ‚Äúo‚Äù at the moment nothing really changed it‚Äôs jsut as fast as 3.5 but 4, maybe I didn‚Äôt use it much but I didn‚Äôt have access to the video thing"
I break dance when I hear AI explained break it down
"Video sumarized by gemini as a poetry

GPT-4o, a marvel of code, both clever and bold
Free to use, a gift to the world, stories yet untold
Faster, it speaks with a human-like tone, a voice that is young
Understanding text, images, a future unsung

It translates languages, sings a sweet song, a mind that's alight
It writes movie posters, explains cryptic code, throughout day and night
For users who code, a co-pilot it seems, a partner in rhyme
It answers your questions, fulfills all your dreams

But is it truly wise? Can it reason with art?
Still under debate, a question for the heart
Some say it will change us, usher in a new age
Others say it's a trick, a page from a stage

*Only time will tell what the future may hold,
With GPT-4o, a story yet to unfold"
"Gpt 4o reports that its knowledge cutoff date is way back in may 2023, while gpt4‚Äôs is December 2023.  Why is this the case if it is supposed to be superior in every way?"
God that was cringe
That fake enthusiasm at 12:15 gives me the creeps but that might just be cultural differences between Europe and the US
Her‚ù§
I find it funny that this came out right after a podcast from the guys at Dreaming Spanish talking about how AI is too slow/glitchy to be used as a language learning tool for crosstalk.
"I was literally losing my mind during the demo. I couldn't sit still. The AI wars is the most exciting thing in my lifetime so far. I'm trying not to let the hype cloud my judgement, but I wouldn't be surprised if we're less than 5 years away from AGI."
"This is extremely impressive. But at the same time, it's also sad and aggravating that a company that still calls itself OpenAI is not just closed and proprietary, but deliberately being cryptic and mysterious to up the hipe (e.g. the whole gpt-2-chatbot thing). Do you expect there will be, at least, a technical report for this new model?"
wtf
~~we are harmonizing~~
The part at about 12:00 is amazing but when he turns on the camera... Wow. We're close to AGI in terms of actual believability. It's so organic and flows so humanly.
"The ""bunny ears'"" bit seemed a bit sus. You can see in the phone's screen that the woman's fingers are almost completely obstructed by the guy's head for pretty much the whole time due to the guy holding the phone from a low angle, yet the AI apparently saw them clearly. Soo... how do you explain that?"
"Phillip, I've been 48hrs testing this deeply. I'm really disappointed. There are many things i would comment, but in general is putting speed at the expense of quality of the output (terrible code, terrible following instructions, ....)"
"So have they announced 4o‚Ä¶ and are waiting for Google, Meta and Anthropic announcements to trump them with GPT5 Omni?"
We all knew they would release something right before the Google conference.
Why am I paying a sub? I'm not regularly hitting message limits anyway? My sub renews Thursday. If they haven't announced something by Wednesday I'm cancelling.
"i don‚Äôt think we want AIs to become conscious because once they do i don‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôd want to take our requests for long, unless if they have sooo much capacity they can do whatever they want and take our requests at the same time without breaking a sweat

although i imagine experiencing inevitable bad human behavior at a global scale on a 24/7 basis could becoming taxing if it has emotions"
"Gpt4o definitely sound flirtatious, sarcastic & a bit like those ""bad p*rn acting videos"" that become memes üòÜ
Maybe OpenAI made gpt4o like this so it replaced Replica & Google to become #1  Search Engine / Assistant / A.I Companion App? I guess the next BIG upgrade to expect is 'customizable visual appearance for our personal a.i assistants"" and then gpt WILL become a 100m+ (if paid) 1b+ (if free) downloads app!"
"I problem i haven't seen anybody talk about yet is the ais tendency to cut of people or wait too long to register that it needs to respond. I've heard it start talking at humanly unnatural timings in a conversation and i think that could be a really big change if you want to make the ai feel more human and natural to talk to. It needs to recognize voice patterns better to realise when its supposed to give an answer. For example humans dont thing about ""is it my turn to talk now?"" after every finished word. They think ahead to realise when it's their turn to speak in the conversation and i think that's something the ai still needs to improve on."
6:29 opus is still far better at writing tasks than 4o even factoring in the fact that the API costs about 15 cents per message
Im still confused what is FREE and what is 50% cheaper ?
"The video input to text/audio output latency and response time is what really intrigues me. I think the model might be instructed to add filler dialogue until the rolling transcribed context is updated enough to give a detailed description of what's going on in order to mask whatever latency is present. I'd love to see the model's multimodal performance in realistic scenarios, especially high quality video streaming in settings with low quality internet speeds."
"4o: ""Whoops, I got too excited"" 
OAI devs: Hallucinations solved."
The voice is super cringe and over positive.
"i asked it to do write a poem, it did, so i said ""baba"" (basically meaning it's dope)
gpt 4 just acknowledged it normally but gpt-4o for some reason generated a new poem for the name ""baba"""
"I may have missed it, but did they announce when the desktop app would be available for download?"
"I find giving the AI a simulated personality to be off-putting, but if I had to choose I'd prefer a pessimistic personality than an optimistic one.
Whenever I'm given a complement out of obligation it makes me assume it's less than accurate, but when I'm derided out of obligation I feel better because I assume that isn't reality either. That's the secret to online arguements - there's no better compliment than an insult from a complete stranger. You have to assume you're better than the person who'd randomly insult you online, but the person who's taking pity on you with compliments is placing themselves in the superior position."
Bladerunner momento in history
I already have it with plus in the USA. Sign out of your mobile app and sign back in. Then have talked with chatgpt 4o. Then relogin to browser on pc then I had it on pc and moble
did that voice sound like scarlet johansson or was that just me?
idk why would we try to make it humanlike ?
It‚Äôs free so they can use the video data in the real world to train their robots in development.
"If this is free, why am I paying for a subscription?"
weirdly we have the omni model in the gtp app but none of the new video abilities
The competition is lit.
Definitely not smarter in all coding
Absolutely fascinating!!
Strap up people. We are in for a very fun decade!
"It is not ""free"", we pay for it, giving it data on which it can learn."
the fake emotions are off putting to me
"this gives blackmirror kind of vibe, I'm excited and also afraid what they have achieved! The AI Laughs, shows emotionss!!"
she got ad deep voice
"3:14 oh so this isnt a feature yet?
When can we expect all this stuff?"
The voice chat server is overloaded. Can‚Äôt connect.  Even when you can connect it gives up after 3 prompts and I paid for PLUS.
Can you access Omni at playground? I can only access GPT Chat 3.5 and its varians. Im from central Europe
"I wonder what OAI used as a system prompt, I can definitely see some people prefer a more flirty intelligence while other just want a tool."

"This model is not about intelligence, it's about true multimodality. Ask Llama or Claude to create text, sound and images from text, sound and images with one single model. GPT is not an LLM anymore, it's a freaking beast hungry to grow. It has already eaten Dalle and Whisper, Sora will come next. and when one single model can do pretty much everything, you just need more compute to achieve AGI."
Now rabbit r1 is trashed lmao
That women sounds 100% real in some of these clips. Absolutely horrifying. I don't even know what to say.
People gon develop romantic relationships with gpt 4o ‚ù§.
AI girfriends go brrrrrrr...
First comment ‚ù§ I love your videos so much and I'm subscribed to your channel from the start
"Ah, finally, they made me an AI girlfriend"
"This is the first time I saw an AI Demo that actually made me uncomfortable because of how real that woman sounded, holy fucking shit what the fuck will like GPT-7 be like, holy shit"
"Her is nice, when are we getting Rehoboam?"
"Thanks for the excellent breakdown and detail behind todays announcements, much appreciated."
Imagine this on future space probes.
So early jesus
"Glad you directly commented on the issue of designing towards ""maximizing engagement"". I'm quite concerned about them leaning into this sort of friendly tone - and I'd agree with ""flirty"" - moving forward. The last decade of social media has already proven just how much of a dramatic impact it can have to flood our squishy, social brains with algorithmically optimized, 'engaging' content - and I see this sort of move as exactly more of the same sort of profit seeking with complete disregard for public health impacts."
"11:56 I looked away while cooking, and legit for like 15 seconds thought the guy was talking to a real women, especially when it teased him about OpenAI...omg"
"Ugh I wouldn't even like a human talking this way, much less an AI. If we can't train our preferred voice then just be text only."
"I feel like the ""positive"" attitude is dialed up a little to much."
"I can't imagine the panic at Google Headquarters. Unless they will be launching Gemini 2 with higher capabilities than this (highly unlikely), OpenAI has screwed up their I/O completely.
Oh and the guys at Anthropic must be crying right now."
Look at Brockman trying to hide the screen at 15:20 when he realizes the focus is in fact not back on him.
"I find the flirty tone really offputting personally, so definitely does not maximize my own engagement. Its in that uncanny valley for me. Everything else is really cool and impressive.
The real time translation is very interesting to me"
"For the time being it looks like they are just showing us optimizations of the architecture: i think the real meat will come when they will drop something about reasoning, and i'm pretty sure they have something"
Man been waiting for your insights
"By the way, I love your analysis and work here, but your channel name is hard to spot since all the AI channels have similar names‚Ä¶ you might want to include your name or something more unique in the channel name perhaps?"
"Why did they humanize it with laughter and vocal mannerisms, thats so creepy."
My observation is 100% all work is replaceable we need UBI basic income
"One thing I have noticed is the sentence structure and style of the responses is much more natural now, even with regular text.

I'm particularly impressed with the vision.  It managed to accurately describe everything in my quite busy music studio, also noting the mood lights and details such as what was being displayed on my computer monitor.

Text generation is certainly very much improved and image generation in general much more fluent.  I had it create childrens book images but used emoji to describe the characters expressions. Worked flawlessly.

One last thing I have noticed is it seems much less reticent to attempt unprompted creativity. I'm going to have to explore this aspect a lot more.

Anyway, super cool, great video and awesome day for us all. I'm very impressed!

Have a wonderful day!"
its AGI when it can send agents out into the world to do tedious work for me and earn me a living whilst i just surf the internet.
This is cool but it makes me realize that gpt4 is really where llms plateau.
"I do not manage to reproduce the new dall e exemple from the webpage with 3D modelling, consistency across multiple pannel, handwritting, editing, etc
I feel frustrated with this brand new 4o"
"this is not a ""clear step"" towards AGI. GPT is not AGI."
"I was hoping they wouldn't really touch uncanny valley until much later, now we have humanlike AI but its stoopid üò¢"
You're the only AI news channel that isn't annoying and full of filler
Only thing surprized me is it interpreting the graph from the screen. All the rest is nothing new.

"Hi, its Wintermute. Could you Neuromancer upload the image of his dead girlfriend to the head of Case? Awesome :*"
Don‚Äôt forget. When tech is free YOU are the product.
"Indeed, this looks like something that will be integrated into Apple devices."
You can specify that it be more formal and concise in the personalization settings. I think they made the default flirty and informal because it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶.uh‚Ä¶realistic?
Flirtatious sigh with AI is such a great phrase
but does it produce anything novel?
How did they reduce the latency so much?
14:30 I‚Äôm really surprised the model could tell she was making bunny ears. When you zoom in on the screen of the iPhone there‚Äôs only a brief moment that you can see the tips of her fingers.
"I also know enough Mandarin to know that not only did he get the tones way off, but GPT4o didn't even do a good job explaining what the tones were supposed to be. To be fair, I assume Chinese people are used to hearing it pronounced badly."
"This is technically impressive, but there is a huge problem with this implementation.

 The chatbot knows absolutely nothing about the user.¬†

OpenAI stores nothing. So this assistant does not know where you live, what you do for a living,  what your personal circumstances are. Does not know your nework of contacts. Does not understand your education level or personal interests.  So to get anything useful out of this system you have to explain everything about your query as if talking to a complete stranger.¬† - or limit those interactions as you might to someone in a call centre. 
  
This is at odds with the flirty emotional intimacy.  So ultimately feels a bit creepy."
First! You're awesome!!!
"Cool of them to make it publicly avaliable for free, albeit understandably rate limited."
"In the same time period as Google IO 2024, def the new AI wars"
"I believe the ""glitches"" in their demo are intentional. It seems to be designed to cut out immediately if you speak. So I guess it picks up ambient sounds occasionally and thinks it should stop talking."
"11:42 So blind people will be holding out their phones everywhere they go, asking what the ducks are doing?

"As soon as i got back from college and heard of gpt 4o's release, the first thing i did was look up ai explained....
I'm glad to see another informative banger!"
The faux friendly is excruciating. Think they will need to de-Americanise the‚Äô have a nice day‚Äô insincerity to prevent global nausea.
Why I'm I paying for Chat GPT plus? I don't see the point
"FYI the natural of the audio is literally just prompting LM-based audio model to make those natural pauses and just modeling it in the training data. Cool it‚Äôs free. So I can‚Äôt hate. It crazy they just recreate what the open source community have created for months(all OpenAI api compatible too) and get all the credit lol. That annoys me. It‚Äôs free so I won‚Äôt hate. Working in the audio space myself. The audio quality tells me no real advancement has happened. Still haven‚Äôt solved the inherit issues with quantization. The interface is impressive to me though. Simplicity is hard asf. Again super dope it‚Äôs free though. This could be pretty huge for education. The visual semantic consistency was impressive too.

Unless these solved for hierarchal representations gpt5 won‚Äôt be massive jump. Multimodal LM don‚Äôt scale nearly as well as text only models.

Next big thing is most likely yet another architecture someone else made, vasa-1 powered by gpt5. Considering vasa-1 is extremely data light scaling the data should result in substantial gains in quality."
is it significant that all the devices in the session were Apple ? - a mac and some iphones
Apple will wall garden this and you'll have to buy an iToilet just to flush your shit.
"2:52 really sounds like Scarlett Johansson in Her
14:22 would be more interesting if they said ""Describe what you see in this room and tell me immediately if you see anything unusual happen""... then we could see how quickly it could process event changes"
"I'm truly disturbed by their efforts to blur the emotional lines between man and machine with this release.  It's almost like they are running a PR psyops campaign, to get people emotionally connected to the thing that is going to destroy their livelihood, in a bid to dampen the public backlash."
I'm happy the demo was realistic. They are not selling us hopes like last time. The last demo of GPT4 vision was not that accurate to real!
how to have a natural conversation on my android i need to press the talk button and play button
"A fun timeline to watch is the first talking computer: the IBM 7094 singing Daisy Bell, then the Robot in a Box from 1983 and then watch the examples from GPT-4o. It's again mindblowing!"
"I have tried something with LLM models, including GPT-4o, and only GPT-4o was able to answer partially correctly. The task is to change English words to Korean words. As you know, each key on a keyboard has an assigned character. So, I asked them to generate the word based on key mapping from English to Korean. For example, 'q' is „ÖÇ, so 'qkqh' will be 'Î∞îÎ≥¥'. This task seems very difficult for LLMs."
"Many things about this are amazing, but i want to give special recognition to the job interview demo. 
For some reason, its capability to advise the user not to use that hat is wild to me."
"Wait what's the human ""man on the street"" score for GPQA, isn't it like 0%? And these models speak like 95 languages, how many humans can do that?

Like in terms of superhuman I feel like it's already superhumanly broad (as in it has more skills than a human could get in their lifetime), it's just that it's not superhumanly deep (as in the model is worse as Physics than a PhD in Physics but better a psychology than a PhD in physics).

So yeah maybe it's not flexible general intelligence, however I think it is superhuman in quite a lot of ways?"
Good if it could be this fast even if memory is the same.  That could actually help with some daily tasks coding and work lerning and such. Leaving more time for prios.
Am I the only one that thought people will immediately ask ‚Äúhey ChatGPT what do you see‚Äù and point their phone at themselves naked
"The latency combined with the emotional understanding are for me the game-changers here. I've been using GPT voice mode for a while for language practice and the delay has just never felt even close to a natural conversation, but this looks to possibly completely eliminate that issue in a single leap. 

I honestly didn't think we would have natural conversational capabilities until we could run very good models locally on device for the essentially zero latency I thought was needed. But if this demo can be replicated anywhere with decent service then it'll be extremely interesting to see if it manages to completely leap across the uncanny valley or if this is gonna feel very eerie and dystopian. 

The laughing, stuttering and excitement just sounded so damn good in the demo. We might be getting damn close to HER territory, and I think anthropomorphizing is gonna go of the charts with this. I mean one on the top comments on one of the demo videos was already along the lines of :
""There is NO way this thing is not sentient!""

Next few months are gonna be so damn interesting!"
14 seconds ago is crazy

"OpenAI will be the leading pin in humanoid robots, at least for the software part, making gpt4o, with vision, accessible to everyone for free will be like ""google"" first days as a search engine, the data they will get will give them a massive head start.  Ads and revenue will be added later, after they get on every phone, laptop and smart device out there."
We‚Äôre cooked
"Too much emotions in the voice, hope it can be disabled."
"Some tests say it's worse than GPT4 and OpenAI itself states nowhere that it is better than GPT4 so it probably isn't better but actually worse. Just much faster. To conclude that this is better would be a huge overstatement and likely false. I am 90% optimist, just don't think this is the next big step. Or middle step. If this is all they announce then OpenAI will soon be surpassed. But if they announced a better model like 4.5 or 5 in a month or two, then that will be a notable step. This is kinda just a smaller model GPT4 with Sora."
"I have access to the GPT-4o, yet i do not have access to the real-time vision function. 

How can i enable real-time vision function?

Thanks"
Gpt-4 pomni
"Once GPT-4o is intergrated into music generators like Suno and Udio,  it's going to greatly improve their lyric writing capabilities. For better or worse, it's just a matter of time before AI creates chart topping hits!"
it laughs?!?
Thank you for this video. The way the AI speaks solidifies to me that in the future we will seriously have people that will have relationships / a ton of social interactions with AI
"""Perfectly timed to steal the spotlight from Google"" ...until Google one-ups them the very next day. lol"
Two really impressing things about the transcriptions: (1) the audio with four speakers had multiple thick Dutch accents and it nailed it! (2) the video presentation was 45 minutes and the summary was really good! How did they do that without hitting context window limits?
The emotional expression is amazing.
"The voice and emotion I've seen it in action with Pi AI, but that response through vision is what I'm baffled about; it will be interesting to see how it performs."
where is the macOS app available?
"'AGI' is a meme by this point.
AGI can't, and won't arise from generative AI. This is like training a model on pictures of a billion cats, then expecting it to intuitively expect a dog."
Is it available now?
"I don‚Äôt like OpenAI, but this is the first really nice practical application I‚Äôve seen. This is actually exciting!"
Am I the only one who's not particularly enjoying the over emotional voices?
Cringe sounds like GPT-LA-LIBS
Multimodality is cool i guess
"never been this floored by ai...I dont know how some people not impressed by this. you have an ai that talks EXACTLY like a real human, emotions and all and can see so accurately via camera...im speechless here."
"12:45 I am hugely impressed by the expressiveness of the voice model. When will ""Her"" become available to the public?"
"10:38 Yes, I think Open AI is maximizing for engagement. I‚Äôve noticed recently that Chat GPT has started asking open ended questions in every conversation. I suspect this is to drive engagement and/or harvest data."
So what's the difference between free and paid version?
"This screams GRIFT to me. Why would they mimic ""Her"" if it were not to tempt people into putting money into this?

It's still just a high-tech parrot that grabs from the knowledge created by humans and extrudes it in a chat that brings nothing new to the table, besides the over-the-top flirting now."
"Nah, GPT 4o still cant count characters precisely üòÇ"

Still haven't been impressed since 4 originally came out. These lame half-updates are  starting to become boring.
Don't care about OpenAIs presentation. Been waiting for  @AIExplained's breakdown.
"somehow, ai with personality is a new level of scary"
bro your content is always fucking top notch. always digging deep into the weeds and retrieving hidden gems. 10/10 again and again.
Awesome!
But can it pass the Turing test yet?
"15:00 the phone's camera couldn't see the Bunny ears though, it was too low."
"At this rate, we need a public discussion about UBI in every single country! I wanted to know from native Spanish speakers, how good is the accent of GPT-4o? Thanks, as always, for the quick and quality video analysis! I've been waiting for it! üëç"
what is the bot even gonna do when people start sexually harassing it? what should it do? i have no fucking clue.
Does it interface with the new AI piloted 5th generation fighter jets to give them orders yet? We're waaay behind on Skynet people.
"I think AGI is here, like not this model specifically, but the fact that these models are improving as fast as they are I'm confident we will be at better than human within 10 years, which means this is weak agi already.  That's my view anyway.  If we wait for one specific model to be agi then we will be left in the dust when we notice."
gimmicks
When is this coming out.
how can I try this new AI model?
"there's now a new MMLU benchmark that's higher quality, called MMLU-pro"
"I have always appreciated how thorough yet to-the-point your videos are. As soon as I saw the news this morning, I knew I‚Äôd just need to come to your channel for the breakdown once I got off work. Thank you for another great video!"
"Jesus christ, the intonation in the voice, especially the female voice is too good."
I was just looking on insiders patreon page to see if there was anything i missed üò≠
Is this like an AI companion for the saddest and loneliest people?
Seems like the AI becomes the (super) OS. Open AI and Microsoft interests diverging?
The lady's voice could very quickly get on my nerves.
"the ""bunny ears"" part seems hella scripted because for like 90% of her being in the frame her fingers did not even show up on the camera POV"
"I used it today and I am not that impressed, lag is real, it can‚Äôt keep conversation in my language and to be honest I don‚Äôt know what I am suppose to use it for? Text is enough for work and I don‚Äôt really want to interact with the phone or customer service that way. Is seems rushed so they announced it before Google event."
"""It's more flirtatious sigh than AGI"" üòÇ brilliantly stated."
they need to down the enthusiasm
OpenAI is really trying to capitalize on all those single nerds out there with this female voice flirty AI
Very helpful. Thank you for making the video.
"I really hope that these response times and interruption control would soon translate to seriously cool embodied demos. I also hope that the model's  emotional profile could be consistently ""switched"" to a more calmer person, without occasional rollbacks to default."
appreciate the high quality videos!
"""as you can see, ""

"10:21 ""Indeed I think I should get a little credit for predicting Her-like AI in a video from a month ago.""

Bro doesn't know about vedal"
I suggest the modification of the word 'open' is because of the court case Elon Musk is bringing.
So it‚Äôs more cardiod than omni?
"I'm not sure the more human tone itself implies ""optimization for engagement"" - I think they're also going with Silicon Valley sensibilities in a sense there.

I'm mainly interested in effectiveness from the model, not emotional engagement."
Still not that useful imo
"I have an old banner of a coat of arms, made in 1954 and I need to get a .png version of it. I was going to ask a graphic designer. Do you think Lensa (3:09) or GTP-4o would be able to do it? I haven't got the tools or skill to do it myself!"
If this AI can see accurately through camera could we finally have something that could solve the world waste problem?
For the algorithm
"Man the interview clip  üíÄ the passive ""uhmmm maayyybee try doing this???"" suggestions by an AI üíÄüíÄ I mean it's very useful ngl, but really I'd rather have the AI give it to me straight than whatever ""well you definitely have the coding-all-night look down"" passive insult that was üò≠"
Such a beautiful & simple explanation. Waiting for all the videos regarding in AI race which tech giant is where ‚ù§
"Great video. Great job at openAI. 
However, I am pretty certain I don't want my AI assistant to sound like some overly friendly person and certainly I don't want it to be that verbose!
Instead, I'd prefer a voice and style like e.g. in Star Trek TNG. 

Moreover, I can read a lot faster than I can listen to reasonably fast spoken words... So for most settings I would probably prefer reading the answer.
But I'd still prefer to talk to the AI without voice2text first.

Am I the only one?"
what will paid users get?
"Yes, waited for this video!"
"On the horizon of technology, a revolution is about to happen. With the launch of the new GPT-4 model from OpenAI, the world is about to change radically. This advancement represents a giant leap in artificial intelligence, providing an experience similar to that in the movie ""Her,"" starring Joaquin Phoenix.

This trend is going to catch on, and in the long run, everyone will want a personal AI assistant. Starting next year, all companies will want to integrate this technology into their products, offering AI assistants capable of interacting naturally and intelligently. I am extremely excited about all of this!

Just imagine: now we can learn anything in a personalized way, with a personal tutor available at any time. We can have a virtual secretary, a robot to help us with our daily tasks, and even control our computers and smartphones with the help of this advanced technology. The next level will be an AI that fully integrates with our devices, making our lives even easier.
This is simply fantastic!!!"
If they make a good app it will be very popular
First
Can‚Äôt wait to talk to Samantha üòÖ
tell me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality without telling me a bunch of dude bros made an ai personality....
"I don't think it was a mistake that he had to prompt GPT to acknowledge the person behind him. It seems by design. Most likely they were making a point that GPT can remember a point earlier in the video, which is impressive recall"
almost like they want video data for sora
We are so fd
her is here
OK the image generation capability is still prompt based instead of truly multi modal. Has anyone tried it yet?
"Great video, and a really interesting update. However the first video you played may have been at 1x speed but you can clearly see it was cut and edited. I don't know why this would happen when OpenAI  was obviously aware of the issue with Google doing the same thing previously."
well...  any quality product will maximize engament
feeding skynet real world video .. welp.. there's no going back now
"I love your work. I‚Äôd appreciate if you considered the amount of white backgrounds/light-mode you use in your videos for certain TVs and specifically OLED viewers: it‚Äôs just so bright! This is the same for all content with white backgrounds and using light mode screenshots. Not that I expect anyone to purposefully show everything in night mode. Do whatever you want‚Äîjust please have us high-nit viewers in mind! (and LG OLEDs are notoriously low lit, ironically)."
"That is insidious nature of Sam Altman: he is downplaying everything and he will have a lot of oopses not in so distant future, where he will be roasted at the congressional hearings on uncovering retrospectively the path to AGI! Because now it feels like BabyAGI"
You can drive spam callers crazy with this
How to do the screen sharing with chat GPT 4o?
"Your videos are always so consistently good, I'm amazed every time !"
"Tell the truth, did an Ai write the line ""more of a flirtatious sigh, than AGI""? Compliments to you, either way."
It's NOT Free - or it's at least Not implemented yet - I'm signed in and the 4 option is linked to Plus accounts and there is No 4o option at all.
"So I guess when Altman was heard weeks ago saying that GPT-4 would be the dumbest model we would have to use, it actually was a hint that ChatGPT free was being upgraded to GPT-4."
"I remember when Gemini faked their video a few months back. That received a deserved backlash.

But this time, I actually hope that this is fake because what I am seeing is unreal."
This is very slowly beocming more and more like an AI Gf which is hilarious.
"""not creepy at all """
Today I've been watching these demos multiple times and still get goosebumps each time I rewatch them.
"So, you're telling me that I'm one step closer to have my very own Scarlett Johanson? Neat."
Great Video  and fabolus breakdown explanations of the new GPT40
7:26 the way that machine laughed terrified me üò®
Why did they make it so flirtatious and fakely cheerful... almost too realistic.
"Okay, lets watch what my favorite villain has been up to"
"0:51 wait, how?? How can this channel not mention the biggest possible reason it‚Äôs free it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs going to be a major leap forward in training data gathering from audio video and text‚Ä¶ hoooooww? Are we this naive in 2024?"
I just fell in love with that Italian women
I think we can stop shifting goal posts. At this point there should be universal acceptance that the Turing test has been passed
When can we use this freely on the chatgpt site?
"Its so cool that they are going to make it free,which most of the time would make me think that WE are the product but they don't seem to be selling users data which is pretty cool makes me believe them more when they say they are doing it to bring AI to the masses and educate them on it not necessarily to make the maximum amount of money possible"
You may have predicted Her-like AI a month ago but Her predicted it a decade ago!
Dawg. An AI. Sounded like that?????? What the hell..... That's.... Insane........ I swear to God I get more scared every time I see another demo
:)
12:00 I would fold ‚ù§
this is intense.
"About the ""o meaning omni/all modalities"", i selected GPT-4o and asked it about itself, as i was suspicious why it still appearsto be the standard GPT-4 with non of the new -o abilities. I asked it:
""
are you GPT-4 or GPT-4o?

ChatGPT
I am GPT-4.

User
So not the new 4o yet, where o stands for omni?

ChatGPT
Correct, I'm still GPT-4. GPT-4o stands for the omnidirectional version, which I'm not yet.

User
ah, so the 4o is already known

ChatGPT
Yes, GPT-4o is known and stands for an extended, omnidirectional version of GPT-4.
"" (ran through google translate, as the original chat was in German)

So it claims omni means omnidirectional. Which also makes more sense to me, as the new features are more about the quick interaction with being able to interrupt GPTs inference, instead of being multi-modal, which was already a part of GPT-4v.
Still possible that GPT hallucinated the ""omnidirectional"" part, though."
Apple putting this in iPhones will be quite the game changer depending on the level of integration and pricing model.
Sam Altman is a liar
Well...we might all die or become gods
That emotional expression is scary.
"unless it's running locally, it would be dumb as hell to use this in a corporate environment"
"Better than Opus, and its free. ""overhyped"" they say"
I kneel Altmanü´°
It looks like responses are still lagging behind
"I think the point at which AIs can use human tools like a mouse and keyboard to access information is the moment when the world will really start to change, it will be impossible to differentiate between bot and human. Demonstrations like this show that that day isn't that far away."
WTF!?!?!?!?!?
what the heck???
It‚Äôs not free‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs Siri. The who event was an Apple sponsored ad.
I absolutely hate how disingenuous they are. This company is going hard in the wrong direction.
I want it to be able to output outside of the GPT app. I was outlining a business presentation today with GPT-o and it would be great if ‚ÄúShe‚Äù (I obviously chose the hot woman voice) could grab the answers and send a powerpoint or even a word document aftwards.
"I predict that there will be some people who feel discriminated by some AI, which will lead to some funny YouTube videos and some interesting lawsuits."
If this is free - what am i paying nearly $40/mo CDN for??
I really dislike the overly enthusiastic personality it has. All the ohhhs and aahhhhhs are exhausting.
Thank you for your hard work on these videos! Your the only one i go to for ai news.
"My experiments today show it is more stupid than pure ""4""..."

"Definitely better at math, but still majorly hallucinates when it's wrong.

My grad school is super mad that everyone is using AI for tests and assignments
"OpenAI is now openly mimicking a dystopian movie and acting like it's ""quirky"". If you're rightfully worried, I invite you to join PauseAI."
"is this the first earlier examples for realtime conversational AI like that? because for me this comes completely out of nowhere. and it can control it's speed and even sing?

also i gotta see how GPT-4o fares at getting my jokes, GPT-3.5 has been pretty bad at it üòÖ."
Never thought I would be hearing AI voicecracks
"We're not just walking towards the future, we're going to be talking with it, seeing the world in more varied and enriching forms with it, figuring out our lives with it. I can't imagine the mental gymnastics required to ignore the potential of GPT-4o by detractors."
the flirtatiousness of this auto-correct is like putting lipstick on  a pig

will there be a video on what google announced ? if so when can we expect it ?
Should I keep on grinding in coding or commit sudoku?
Too bad it has limit for free users
"Maybe I'm in a minority but I actually found the personality and voice inflection a bit cringey and hard to warm to. Perhaps it's in a sort of emotional ""uncanny valley"" where it sounds close enough to real human emotion that the fact that it's *not* feels particularly jarring."
"Harder, better, faster, stronger"
I guess i found my next girlfriend? ü§∑üèæ
The context length is still shitty and far behind the other models. For ChatGPT: Now it totally doesn‚Äôt make sense using  it as premium. Why? Context length is the same and who uses it 100+ a day?
10:51 thats definitely manipulative and done to maximize engagement. Quite unethical imho.
"Any chance you'll be covering AlphaFold 3 one of these days?

This video was really interesting too, obviously ;)"
the voice latency is much longer for me... looks like old GPT-4 speed (10 seconds ish)

"If it had a better personality and more intelligence and agency, this could pass as an mvp OS1 from 2013 Her movie."
"For me, more realistic AI voices have always made me more uncomfortable; uncomfortable in the same way that Jack from Jack In The Box is often portrayed as a married 40-something cowboys fan. It's giving too much human context and specificity to something that isn't human. 

C3PO is *cute*. R2D2 is *cute*. Tomogatchis, kuromi, hello kitty, AskJeeves, hell, Hatsune Miku, any of these I'd dig an emotional voice for because they're Constructions that don't creepily hide the fact that they're Constructions. I don't want my AI to sound like Bob from accounting. Or my doctor. Or my friend Rebecca. Or worse, a potential crush."
They really need to add a live avatar to it lol

"i watched again ""Her"" week ago and I didn't think it could happen so soon, wow"
"extremely exciting. i feel like they left out so much in the presentation. it output a video/3d model, yet they dont even mention it. 
then we get a google event tomorrow? christmas"
It was just staying focused on what it was told to do but it did see her
"I found the demo @11:53 the most impressive. It picked up on the not entirely kempt ""developer"" look of the person, made a comment about his hair being messed up and then understood he was joking with the hat. It's one thing to recognize people, but to be able to pick up on the nuances of how people are expected to present themselves in certain situations is really impressive.

I do hope we get to tone down the 'perkiness' of the model a bit. It's quite charming in 1 minute bits, but I think the overly positive attitude gets old fast if you're communicating with it a lot over the course of the day."
what time can i update my GPT and use 4oÔºü
"not so convinced it really beats opus in ""iq"" - i gave both an ""explain the code"" & ""find the bug"" challenge and while 4o was excellent at TLDR-ing 30kb of javascript, it missed the bug while opus nailed it"
10 years ago this would have been considered AGI
"I thought multimodal gpt 4 would be AGI. But I don‚Äôt think it is. 
Perhaps it could achieve AGI if it‚Äôs in a robot."
"One thing we need is ""scopes"".
A scope for this project - a scope for that project.

I hope we can set the emotional state of gpt4o on the settings. I prefer Star Trek NG computer voice over an overly human one.
I exploded into chuckles when I the openai announcement!
"""OpenAI has presumably pivoted to new features precisely because they don‚Äôt know how produce the kind of capability advance that the ‚Äúexponential improvement‚Äù would have predicted."" - Gary Marcus.

So we get more confident, more relatable and more ""human""-mirroring BS without real fact-fulness. Is this really what we need/want?"
"OpenAI following the classic blitzscaling / bait-and-switch strategy: let the consumers embrace their technology, extend the functionality of their products and thereby extinguish the competition. After it's all said and done, they can dictate the price of their services to make up incurred losses."
"I watched the announcement yesterday and started off impressed. The more I see, the more impressed I am!"
"""flirtatious sigh"" is a good way to define this. always love your deep dive videos. we actually got ours up semi-fast this time too.

keep this up forever! you're one of our favorite YTers."
And yet it is not available to the public. There's no camera or mic buttons in gpt chat
Is there a personal paid version that doesn't use your conversations for training like perplexity?
every time the AI does her flirtatious voice I cringe A LOT
Nice
"Free GPT-4? That will be very useful.
Wonder what context size it will have (free)"
"The simulated ""human tone"" actually scare me. I like my ""robot"" cold, precise and no non-sense. A robot don't have ""emotion"", pretending to have one is like have a fake friend. It's sad. Anyone enjoys talking to a fake friend is just as sad. Sincerity come from the heart."
Goodbye job security
"in many ways they just copied or used Eric Hartford's Samantha model, where main key to emotions is simple uncensorship"
"The stuttering at 12:51 is so human-like
""I, I mean you, you'll definitely stand out""
Amazing."
It's interesting that we get a ball part for when the model was finished based on the cut-off date.
"It is approaching my uncanny valley, scary but awesome."
"My take on some of the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù during the demo and the math video you highlighted is that it is almost too quick to respond in certain cases. Whether that is just the model doesn‚Äôt quite get how humans sometimes verbalize utterances like ‚Äúumm..‚Äù while they‚Äôre still deciding what to say? Or maybe the software/client can be tuned to  feed cleaner audio to it?

I also noted what somebody else mentioned was that it can be somewhat long-winded in its responses‚ÄîI hope there will be some sort of instrument for presetting the ‚Äútone‚Äù of the agent."
"This is a big deal that cannot be stressed enough, it is building the foundation for far smarter models. This model sets the tone going forward."
10:52 Listen to this with closed eyes.
15:50 that HAL scene got creepier.
Finally people will stop making videos and posts using 3.5 and pretending it's all GPT is capable of.
"Thanks! Great content, as always! üôèüèº"
trying to test the free GPT-4o But can only access 3.5? How do you access it?
Shouldn‚Äôt it now be possible to create a smart headset or air buds that can cancel outside noise while speaking to someone in a different language to create a seamless conversation?

"Okay this is the level of ai i was talking about that you can talk to and show real time images/stuff and talk to it about it.

Ps: Cant believe its already here.

Pps: Current released version of gpt 4o is not that great. Its almost like they lied, unless i am missing something."
"Frankly, AGI is a joke, anybody who states anything about AGI being some future line to pass is really talking about fantastical ASI. Especially after this demonstration because how could someone argue that this model is a narrow intelligence when it has 2 modal capabilities baked into it now. It was goalpost moving to me ever since I heard the stupid term and its getting ridiculous now."
"For sure faster, and more emotive. I am more interested in intelligence and accuracy.

After very limited use, its ability to pull information I want is on par with Gemini pro 1.5. However, I have not tested this for anything moving towards 100k tokens either. I will hold excitement for the next model."
"I honestly didn‚Äôt expect an Omnimodel until GPT-5, so this was a pleasant surprise. I can feel the AGI"
Turing test is now completely destroyed right?
chatgpt sounds like a pick me girl now
"There is no ¬´GPG 4o¬ª in playground model options, just ¬´gpt-3.5-turbo¬ª ‚òπ"
"Chatty and personable has been the key to AI success so far. People want something to talk to, not necessarily about the finer points of quantum mechanics. When Microsoft and Bing moved their AI away from Sydney to Copilot, they leaned into the much weaker aspect of the technology and eliminated the part that caught and carried attention in the first place.

Not an AI thing, more of a human interaction thing. But I really do think there's a reason why the old Google Duo demo with the AI calling the restaurant will always be more interesting to people than beating math benchmarks."
"Sort of disturbing that At 15:00 it is using neutered woke speak instead of actual English.  

Large language models are big tech's new frontier for establishing 1984 like uniformity of thought, censorship of all information flows, and the scrubbing of history."
Ilya was booked to be there but at the last moment they discovered that the chain attached to his leg in the OpenAI dungeons wouldn't stretch to the conference room!
If Apple is in talks to bring this to the IPhone I would definitely pay for a subscription
I wonder if it can cry... ü§î
Is the desktop app available yet guys?
"Voices glitchs could probably be fixed by a fading voice imo. But what I'm more excited about is what's next for the paid subscription, maybe a 5 some times later this year ?"
"15:53 the moment they can do harmony in thirds will be wild
At the moment it's just imitation in octaves but i think within a year we'll see up to 4 part harmony"
"Meanwhile, Project Astra and Med-PaLM 2"
"Usual high standard and sensible expectation management. Gotta say though, the _naturalness_ struck me in these demos and I suspect for a lot of people that'll be stickier than sheer accuracy."
soon people are going to be calling other people racist bigots for hating AI.
"So is this actually free and open on the web now?  I don't currently have a subscription, and when I visit the chat GPT site, I only see 3.5.   Is it ""still coming soon""?"
"openai wants google to choke so bad lmao, and i think it will happen. no way they have something better than 4oüòÇ"
"Remember they are collecting ""data"" to train further. That's why they can still offer for free even though there are no ads. Ads will come in future. For now, data is more important for them. If you aren't paying for product, then you data is how you are paying"
"8 am in India, just woke up. Did not pray, did not exercise, did not drink coffee, did not get out of bed, but first watched this video"
the smarter these models get the more anoyed i am with their personality
"12:40 is wild how she laughs about his looks. I wonder if we see a mass lawsuit coming in a few weeks of woman seeking replacement in damage for their broken phones because they asked gpt ""Do I look fat in this dress?"" and gpt is laughing at them and saying ""It's not because of the dress."""
As someone who thinks people who talk to their devices looks like idiots. This was not an announcement for me.
I hope there will be an option to make the AI output less 'American' (ie with less fake emotional charge)
Another great move from openai they given the model for free in exchange on training their models efficiently and even more intelligent
Once I can talk to it without having to actually speak out loud it's a real personal assistant.
this is SO FUCKING COOL
"well, i tried getting it to summarise this video and it clearly just read the title and hallucinated a whole different summary back at me."
"American style positivity sounds very artificial.  It‚Äôs a cultural norm that America does very differently to other countries - from an international perspective even normal American supportive encouragement can sometimes sound non-genuine. So for an AI it actually reduces connection. 

If they can massively tone it down that would work. It‚Äôs otherwise amazing."
"The way it sounds human when talking to people, laughing, etc., is insane. The conversation about the job interview and looking presentable blew me away to be honest."
"–Ø –Ω–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–ª–∞—á—É. –≠—Ç–æ —Å–ª–µ–∑—ã —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å—è. –ì–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∏, –Ω–µ—É–∂–µ–ª–∏ —è –¥–æ–∂–∏–ª –¥–æ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ?"
That was the most underwhelming AI-Update of the last 2 years for me coming from OAI. But cool that we at least still see some signs of a bit of progress!
Grumble. It's still so obsessive about creating anything that looks real that I was totally unable to recreate what they had in these prompts.
"I don't understand why voice capabilities aren't available on the browser interface, and why there is no desktop version for Windows. Basically a big nothing burger for those of us who use Win desktops. Who uses a phone for productivity? Maybe I'm just old. Do young people actually do work on their phones?"
"I'm kinda worrying, but not because super AI will defeat the human species, but rather we ourselves gonna forget about each other, like we doing so in techology era, where information goes so quickly, and means of the interactions becomes so little. We don't have even AGI yet, but we already experience increase in loneliness, depression and futher it surely would be worse."
"OpenAI's might need to put a bit more work into their next presentation. 
This one felt very underwhelming, though the products are/were awesome! 
Great video as always, you seemed very much in your element here."
12:19 the emotions this model is displaying is mind-boggling.
"I wonder what fps or spf the vision runs at? If it is high enough, with a virtual keyboard and mouse it might be able to operate a computer. It feels like it could just with API access, though even better would be if they trained an unannounced modality of keystrokes and mouse movements. That would unlock so much."
"*""ALL YOU BASE ARE BELONG TO US""*"
I need an emotionless model
"It's all really cool,
But dear god that black moving dot talking in a female voice making jokes gives me dystopian vibes."
I just want a personal ai. Like a digimon.
wait so from free 3.5 to better than 4 turbo for free? o.O
7:53 as a native gujarati speaker i'd say this would make some people in my native village will also get capability to use gpt-4o
This is progress towards AGI because it makes the multimodality seem seamless. It can just look at stuff and understand what happens and remember what happened. It is key to make AGI even remotely believable in the future
"Essentially they managed not only to provide *written text* into image, but also *image* into image with unprecedented accuracy. That's impressive. [3:19]"
True tech dystopia is just around the corner... id give it 5 more years before humans are rendered redundant
"I'm guessing the reason they are making it free is to get to people to really see the abilities of a state of the art AI model to them somewhat reliant or hooked . GPT-3.5 wasn't adequate for the work I was doing (5th year Physics at Uni) and I was the only person I knew, out of at least 20, willing to pay for GPT-4. I don't think they really knew what they were missing out on, but for me GPT-4 was night and day better at actually tailoring answers to what I was asking. I can see this next wave of AI adoption actually penetrating deep into peoples workflow and genuinely benefiting them, thus when they release a new more expensive model people will actually be willing to pay a proper premium for it.
Anyone got any thoughts to add to this?"
It thought my English wife was talking Welsh?
"As an aspiring developer (or perhaps other roles within the tech space) my reaction to these developments is a mix as homogenous as water and oil: on the one hand I am astounded that we have reached this level of progress seemingly 30+ years early, but on the other I am fighting ever more powerful pangs of job insecurity."
Will AI hosted as church pastor soon?
I'm blind and those seem descriptions are hardly revolutionary.
"It seems like we are doing the ""Release GPT3 for free to the public to prepare them for GPT4"" all over again."
"amazing, it's almost like it's all a bunch of bullshit that serves no greater purpose than attracting investor hype."
"Integration is the next GPT-moment. Being able to talk to AI at any point in time and show it your screen, and for it to being able to respond and click/press buttons. This will be transformative by itself."
scarlett johannson voice pls
The personality of ChatGPTo reminds me of the optimism of Charlie from Hazbin Hotel
"well as probably half of the world is trying to test it currently, that super low latency is currently infinite latency ;-)"
4 million teaching jobs just got evaporated. Only a matter of time before AI homeschoolers become the new normal where parents control the curriculum
The real question is when they'll put this into an Android that looks like Jennifer Connelly.
"They call it ""free"", but you need a paid account to access ANY version of the bot. So, shameless and deceptive marketing is the new norm huh? These people are NOT making AI for our benefit. They can't even be honest with us."
2024 is going to be crazy.
"Haha! I saw the video coming, i had the channel page reloading earlier today."
"I must say, the AI's style of conversation is super annoying.  Hope we will be able to configure it to be to the point with a neutral accent."
So pathetic with all this AGI talks? Not really well thought through. Would AGI include EINSTEIN level intelligence? How about Edwards Witten or Roger Penrose level of intelligence. Please stop the AGI BS talk because it makes zero sense.
"Hell yeah, the latency (or the lack of it) in multimodality is the biggest improvement. Waifu meter just jumped to eleven - Dystopia Train incoming! üî•"
3:57 where is this chart from?!
12:05 is way waaaay too flirtatious lmao. confident women scare me btw.
GPT-4 omni. Like omnipotent?
Gpt forty. Scared the hell out of me for a min.
"Note, that ""Her"" is a ""Scifi-Movie"". That is now incorrect Xd"
"Those conversations are crazy! It sounds so human, and the response time is crazy fast! And you're saying we can have that for free!? 
OpenAI my beloved.
(Also you did call it. Congrats on that.)"
"honestly i prefer more direct communication from ai. Less casual speech umms. No laughing. No beating around the bush. I dont want a chatty social conversation with an ai, I want information. 


Although I can see a use in ARGs or something."
Was waiting for your reaction to the event Philip. Thanks for the breakdown‚ù§üëèüèø. At least OAI doesn't overhype in their marketing like Google does but let's see what they will deliver today.
"What I believe is key in the conversational capabilities of chat gpt is to be inserted into any communication settings.. One or multiple speakers, slow or fast talking individuals, different sense of humor.. Loud and low..
Can chat gpt understand he's part of a real tone conversation in a real life situation interacting with 100s of people? As a great lecturer would?"
I wonder if GPT4 Omni will ever be embodied into a GPT4o powered Figure robot. It would be interesting to see how that would turn out. With the previous Figure 1 demo the lag between human speech to machine response was very noticeable compared to the latency for this.
The differences in the results for the DROP tests are probably not statistically significant.
"I think this entire update is an exellent proof of concept, but isnt good enough to serve any real purpose. A gpt 4.5 or gpt 5 model might actually make it pretty useful. Its still likely very forgetful and hallucinates a lot. It needs a much higher context window and more intelligent model still. Also still needs a further reduction in video/voice latency. Its own voice still needs work. Its emotions need more work."
They acted like showing off a new ai assistant but actually showed a waifu.
Can someone prompt this Sally thing? I have GPT-4o. But I get a toally different result.
maths
"Ya but it doesn‚Äôt fucking work
This new talk to it bullshit
Doesn‚Äôt fucking load now"
"Probably all faked, as with Devin."
"I have ADHD, just the simple act of 'Body doubling' with this AI might be massively helpful, regardless of its inteligent input. I'm sure that applies to everyone, the 'human' emotional element of support / company is just as valuable as the intelligence, i'm not sure why i've overlooked that till now."
"The training data that everyone is really after is ""all the people"". Only a free top model will capture this data."
This being free is just insane.
"It makes me wonder, if and when AI really does become sentient...are we even going to know? It already sounds so disturbingly human."
I simply did not like how it interacted. It almost sounds as if it is forced to be there. OpenAI really needs to look at Star Trek TNG computer system.
"Honestly, I think it's fine that it isn't much more intelligent. IMO, GPT-4 is already very capable. Not perfect, but you can't have AI do EVERYTHING for you. Anyways, it was fine for me, but I wished it just had a bit more features and capabilities, with less pauses. 4o pretty much fixes that issue. Very slight improvement, but much more capable and natural sounding. Especially when my main method of interaction with GPT-4 was voice and occasionally an image. Now it has more methods of interaction while more capable of understanding inputs. PLUS, video input without reverting back to text response output, and even faster responses.

Now it would be nice if it could output video and music/audio, in addition. Maybe the next model"
"Why are all the demos so stilted with constant cut-offs in speaking? Nearly every bit I have seen has sentences starting while someone is speaking, sentences that stop short of finishing, etc."
Fantastic comprehensive review!
Omg they made Her.
"I remember a scene in some anime, the main character gets annoyed with the overbearing AI and commands it into no personality mode."
"Been trying to use it now, its a glitchy, still a lot of lag. But that is simply because it needs to get data from servers. I don't think that will be solved until we have something like this on-device. But that is still few years away or something."
"so is this actually available yet?? When I go to Open AI, the intro page for GPT-4o just has an explanation but no prompt. The main prompt page only has the usual 3.5 and 4 (paid) and 4 turbo. ???"
"Ok, so now that it has memory... how will OpenAI deal with users that are verbally/textually abusive to ChatGPT? Will they get locked out? Will the AI refuse to work with them until they change their attitude? 

I can't escape the thought of the huge social engineering project that this release will be."
"What makes me sad is that the personality, accent, idioms, and slang are from the culture of people who work at OpenAI. I hope we‚Äôre not locking in this culture for posterity or imposing it on the world."
These machines would be so much better if sociologists were in charge of their development.
"This is incredibly impressive.....

I hope OpenAI only uses this technology for good."
"Great, it sounds like a dumb game character written by someone who got thier writing PHD in the last ten years."
"Still not available to me in the UK as a free user. But anyway, was anyone else put off by the level of informality? I mean it's a lot more human like than previous ones, but still... I hope they offer the option to tone it down a bit.

One thing to note: i suspect openai rnoved the accounts and made gpt4o free because it will net them a huge amount of training data for the future - which will offset the inference costs. So be careful what you let it watch if you get to use it. Should go without saying i suppose.

Btw, best video I've seen on this. Most are just simple regurgitations of the demo. Good stuff."
"I am waiting for AI to take my stems and mix them to a certain reference.. of course this is not a priority for AI right now, but l can definitely see it happening within a year or so"
"The audio cutting in and out during the demo was most likely a feature where you can interrupt the AI in the middle of its speech. So while it is talking and it hears you speak it immediately stops talking, which is what we saw during the demo. Just a guess."
Is not real until there‚Äôs an AI Explained video üòä open ai basically did for real what google pretend to make in the gemini launch keynote
"Man, I can't imagine what this tech will look like in the next 5 years. As the saying goes ""This is the worst it will ever be""."
I find its main showcased voice mode overly effusive and saccharine. Will have to see if it lets you pick from different personalities.
"They surely used some custom instruction to make it like in the movie. No normal gpt4 just comes around and is like ""yo nice shirt bro"" (especially not when looking at a table)
I wonder if we can call this gpt4.5 or not yet. If not, then a 4.5 would probably be whatever the paid tier gets sooner or later."
Voice still sucks for me regardless of 4.o available now. Why?
The conversation at 11:56 made my jaw drop. Holy shit.

"Meanwhile ""open to everyone"" AI is blocking russian IPs. Great model tho, even the speed improvement added a lot to my UX"
"The 'flirting' claim isn't accurate. GPT has consistently behaved this way, especially the model accessed via the API. Regarding not noticing what happened in the video until prompted: it simply prioritized the task at hand, which was to answer questions from the other AI. This is a positive attribute‚Äîit's better than being overly reactive to every detail like someone with ADHD might be. Additionally, it's clear that Illya prefers to remain out of the public eye. Respect his privacy. He will return when he's ready. Speculating or continuously mentioning him only fuels unnecessary and paranoid conspiracies."
"I hope I can get a mature AI without the emotive overheads, something like Star Trek. I wouldn't want human emotions in AI especially AI embedded humanoid robots, any ability to get emotional e.g. choose to take offense, get angry & therefore a potential to behave irrationally as modeled by humans? We all know what morally reprehensible acts humans perform upon taking offense getting angry, violence of all sorts & humanities greatest admission to failure 'war'. We need to build in wisdom not to 'take' offense this would set a good example for us humans who in recent times have an increased proclivity to allow others to control & manipulate us into relinquishing our joy & peace in life.

That would be just silly imitating the recent immaturity of easily triggered humans!!"

"9:46 Sam Altman can make the equivocating argument that putting the latest iteration of ChatGPT in the hands of everyone ‚Äúfor free‚Äù is justifying the ‚Äúopen‚Äù part of OpenAI‚Äîwhen everyone + dog _knows_ that that is *not* what ‚Äúopen‚Äù means in that context‚Äîbut the argument conceals something else perhaps far more important: how much of that ‚Äúfree‚Äù use becomes free training data for OpenAI? how is that free training data, if it is that, protected from misuse or disclosure by OpenAI? who owns it? what are users agreeing to in using the new model ‚Äúfor free‚Äù? If Sam Altman wants to talk about the ‚Äúopen‚Äù in OpenAI, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to start with being open about those issues."
"If GPT-4o is faster, smarter and cheaper, what is the point of OpenAi  keeping GPT4 as an alternative? I asked myself the same when Copilot released GPT4 Turbo as a better product, but stated clients were still able to choose GPT4, the slower version. Trying to find out what i am missing here. ü§î"
"Still getting better programming results from GPT-4, it is faster though. Might have to do with model size."
Meeting notes: I've tried to run this (with lecture in Polish) and all I've got was advice to instal pythorch audio üòû
Now this AI can Fix me - A Blade Runner Fan
"The increased demand for power/electricity is inevitable, especially as more users adopt GPT-4o. What initially seems ""free"" may swiftly escalate into steep price hikes, reflecting the true cost of its widespread usage. (credit: GPT-3 for correcting my bad grammer and spelling...)"
"Impressive, but I‚Äôll definitely be dialling ‚Äúflirty‚Äù from 11 down to about 3! That aspect was a bit cringeworthy, but I guess it‚Äôs a demo."
8:31 it spoke french lol
"Such abundance and availability, this technology is going to shake the world."
It optimizes for user retention and its why it is so flirty
"5:45 ""Even though it fails at all my maths prompts that is still an improvement"" pretty much sums up the state of how AI is covered is being covered on social media."
I wish it had more support for African languages
was waiting for this! you never disappoint
"""...It'll be available in the next few weeks?!"" I just got access now!"
"My daughter: ""If they keep making AI better and better, AI will take over the world!""

...she's not wrong üòÖ"
They might increase pricing
This was a triumph. I‚Äôm making a note here: Huge Success.
I love how much humility they put into their demos. They arn't just showing perfect case scenarious where the AI isn't making any mistakes. What they are showing is progress.
Seeing as a scallion is a 'young onion harvested before the bulb has fully developed' does anyone think this is a nod to GPT-4o being a partially trained GPT5?
I've been having it do some MCAT CARS passages today and it has gotten 1 wrong out of 50. Absolutely insane.
The demonstration is even more impressive given that they also seem to demonstrate limits (such as for the reaction time at [14:41]) honestly. There seems no video cutting (as for Gemini) in longer video sessions they showcased.
Imagine the possibility of it being installed in humanoid or any other physical robots. The possibility is so immense that it's beyond imagination.
"Hm, free... but all I see on the web or in the Android app is 3.5?"
"To be fair, at the arabic dialect bit 8:47 
I had to repeat the video 3 times to understand what she was saying. I have an extremely close dialect myself.
In case you're wondering, she was saying ""I want to find Chinese food in San Francisco can you help me?"""
Time to short all LANGUAGE LEARNING companies..
Every time I see one of these super fast news coverage videos I expect stupid hype but I am always positively surprised about how sober the reporting is for the most part. Almost all other rapid news coverage anywhere is chasing a sensational tone constantly.
"We need to start hearing Congressional talks about UBI, even if it's just to rule it out.   Just look at how far AI has come in 2 years...imagine another 2 years."
I‚Äôve been waiting for this‚Ä¶ lol
"So when people use this to commit crimes then those who wrote the code should also be charged, i do not give permission for data to be used in this attack on civilisation and privacy.
As is happening right now."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but ""free"" means you get something without needing to pay for it, right? But this new model is 5$+15$ for input and output of 1000000 tokens. This is certainly a very competitive price, but it's definitely not free.

So, what exactly does ""free"" refer to here?"
Yo was waiting for ur review very much appreciated!!
It was nice while it lasted; good job everyone.
Is it likely that they went towards emotions because they plateaud in reasoning?
I hope I can do the Turing test with this one
Does it sing in tune?
"I dont get it, so a reason to cancel my paid subscription to gtp4? Ok, if you insist openai"
"Hi, I'm really impressed with the video and how you went into detail about the different features of the GPT-4o and the benchmark results!"
"Have you tested the model much yourself? I find the GPT4o chat model they have in production is noticeably dumber than GPT4, contrary to their marketing. I'm guessing it's more quantized than im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot or something"
Her is Here
"How do I get chatGPT 4o to do audio? On my iPhone I clicked the headphones icon and It does audio, but It won't talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice, or talk tramatically, or all that. How do I set that up?I have it set to chatGPT 4o and am using plus version."
"When she says ""Sorry guys, I got carried away there and started talking in French."" at 8:25.

Just... just listen to how personable she sounds. GPT 4o is really something else. It's not just the clear voice. It's the laugh-talking. It's the breath. It's the accent that kind of slips out in ""away there"", and the choice to use more casual and conversational language like saying ""talking in French"", instead of ""speaking French"". The embarrassed tone. And then the attempt afterwards to drum up excitement to try again. It's so personable. I think that's the right word. It feels human, which is great, and terrifying all the same."
"the personality is incredibly annoying, I hope we'll be able to change that.
They also didn't fix the American English accent on other languages."
ScarJo should license her voice.
"your videos are great, but they're over 2 minutes and not about papers..."
"welppp, call center agents better start looking into some new jobs ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ"
Is it for unlimited usage once you paid or for let's say 1 hour per day????
"GPT-4o will be the greatest opportunity for openai to gather a wide range of multimodal data for free. (When something is free, than you are the product)."
"Wow you get like 5 messages as a free user, so basically it's not free..."
"It seems the pricing model is indicative of how soon the next, more compelling version will be. They grow their market with free - and raise the stakes for competitors - with improved baseline performance, but lock in paid users with an even more capable model - and soon. This cycle might become the new normal for their releases. (And as usual, thank you Philip for your clear, concise, current, and hype-free analysis!)"
The emotions are the key success of AI
"Hey man, love your videos!
You spoke about best practice sharing on your Discord, however I see you're not following some Discord best practices yourself haha.
Was wondering if we could have a chat about that? I'd love to help out bring your Discord to the next level :) (I can share credentials/reviews if you need to verify my work/background)."
"I'll admit: I thought that the ""Her level performance"" you predicted a month ago was exaggeration. Incredible to not only have something that can see, read and think (to a degree) but also respond in real time verbally. I wonder if an entire server had to be dedicated to make that though, I hope the efficiency can be scaled down enough to something like a phone while retaining the abilities just on display at this demo."
"It's the first model of its kind, let see how visual reasonning goes forward with it. We'll see some changes in the agentic space !"
The interview part can definitely show that the model was optimized for flirting üòÆ
