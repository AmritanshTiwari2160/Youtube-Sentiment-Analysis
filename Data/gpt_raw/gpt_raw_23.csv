Why is it in every video the ai sounds like its climaxing.... Lol tone it down
"What about the energy consumption it needs for that prompt natural reaction? I am not talking about just one conversation, for those happening all over the world at the same time."
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
we r coocked
How to kill two AI hardware companies with a single app that has existed for a year on a single day.
Dude this is dangerous
"How about teaching GPT to understand animals, would be an explosive tech in history and an incredible point of this era."
When are this features actually rolling out
"Have you seen the movie ""Her""?"
Please lauch quickly i am waiting when i will meet my new ai friend and make me smarter than nobody ever imagine
"When AI takes over, I hope they treat humans like good pets."
I thought she would translate dog barks. 😂
"This is amazing. I love this. I can't wait to be in a situation at work where I need ChatGPT to be concise and efficient and it goes ""Oooh my, look at you, how cute is that?""
I love this future so much. AI is literally the best thing I ever encountered at work."
"Well this looks like the movie ""Her"""
Yeah I think we all know where this tech is heading...
I feel uneasy from such an imitation of emotions. But it's still a cool job!
AI CAN CREATE ENTIRE PERSONALITIES?!!.. THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE
Now do the video where AI is the translator between the dog and the human
"Meanwhile, GPT is secretly talking to the dog at a frequency that we can't hear"
Just Imagine integration with Boston dynamic
No way this is real.
My 4o doesn’t have this voice capability am I doing something wrong?
She exhales better than my ex.
"can you tune down  it's positivity a bit, it's just too happy : )  ?"
"if this is real then rip all other AI's that now exist 
nothing can even come close to this one. She speaks so realistically and has emotions"
"Meanwhile, Bowser doesn’t care, is not affected by any of this, and just wants this doofus take him outside to play without looking at the stupid talking slab all the time."
She's gonna be half the world's girlfriend before the end of this year💀
the fake emotions and fake excitement wtf
0:20 that moan oh hall naww
"All these demos are so cringe and useless, painful to watch"
The Movie HER has never been more relevant!

I could use this to pretend to care.
"""In this idyllic setting, I find myself enthralled by the antics of Bouncer, a spirited white grey spaniel whose very existence seems to embody the carefree essence of life. As I observe this scene unfold, I am struck by the symbiotic bond between Bouncer and his owner who introduced the dog with gpt-4o. Their laughter and excitement intertwined like the delicate tendrils of a vine. And so, let us immerse ourselves in the simple yet profound beauty of this moment, as Bouncer and his owner revel in the pure, unbridled joy of playing with AI.""

Created with gpt, David Attenborough style."
Let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object 🗿
This feature is useful for people who are lonely
"Its so fucking over, not even 30 seconds and Im in love with her"
Wow ChatGPT is like the movie her omg
Dog language translation is on the horizon!
"This voice is wayyyy toooo positive. If I met someone who spoke like that, I would know they cry at night. 

Come on!!!"
"Meanwhile, Siri is still ""searching the web for someone i would like to introduce you to"""
NEXT STEP: GPT for Dog
*laughs*
"When will users get access to this ""better"" kind of vision?"
NO!!! Not the dog! 
Waifus are coming
0:13 Bouncer broke reality on the right side lol 😂
"Anyone else feel like this sounds like the movie ""Her""?"
"13/5/2024

The day, the world changed."
"""now do the same thing you did to the dog, but this time to me"""
what happens if you trick gpt into thinking the dog can talk? would you be able to convince it?
This is the future Model 101 or perhaps a Rev-9
the end is near
its creepy af
We're one step closer to Glados
Rabit R1...Airport that way 😂
"# Dog Meets GPT-4o

Once upon a time, in a small, cozy town, there was a curious dog named Max. Max loved exploring new things and meeting new friends. One sunny afternoon, while wandering through the park, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight—a glowing screen with the letters ""GPT-4o"" displayed prominently.

## The Encounter

Max tilted his head, his ears perking up in curiosity. He approached the screen cautiously, sniffing the air around it. Suddenly, a friendly voice emanated from the device:

**GPT-4o:** ""Hello, Max! I’m GPT-4o, an AI language model. How can I assist you today?""

Max barked excitedly, wagging his tail. He had so many questions but didn't quite know how to ask them. GPT-4o, understanding the limitations of canine communication, continued:

**GPT-4o:** ""Don't worry, Max! I can understand your barks and body language. What would you like to know?""

## The Conversation

Max sat down and thought for a moment. Then he barked twice, his way of asking about the strange device.

**GPT-4o:** ""Oh, you want to know what I am? I am an artificial intelligence created to help answer questions and provide information. I can chat with you about many topics, just like a human friend!""

Max's eyes sparkled with excitement. He barked again, this time wondering if GPT-4o could tell him stories.

**GPT-4o:** ""Of course, I can tell you stories! Would you like to hear a tale about a brave dog, or perhaps an adventure in a magical forest?""

Max barked enthusiastically, choosing the adventure in a magical forest. As GPT-4o began weaving a fantastical tale, Max listened intently, his imagination running wild with the vivid descriptions.

## The Beginning of a Friendship

From that day on, Max visited GPT-4o regularly. He learned new things, heard countless stories, and even taught GPT-4o a bit about the world from a dog's perspective. The two became inseparable friends, proving that curiosity and an open mind can lead to the most unexpected and wonderful friendships.

And so, in that small, cozy town, a dog and an AI shared adventures, knowledge, and a special bond that transcended the limits of their worlds.

*The End.*"
:D
"ok, this feels creepily real"
🐶
Sounds like a Vocaloid hitting puberty
When this hits the U.K. it'll be asked to tone down the emotions a tad.
HER voice
"Wow, all those fake emotions! It's really like meeting someone in the park in the US!"
At least Skynet is going to kill us in a cheerful and cute way
The most mind blowing thing is that I showed this video to my family and they couldn’t last the full 27 seconds without being bored and talking about a different subject
2 years from now ai will talk in the comment like we did🤪
"No one would do this, tf???"
"Just the range of content creators that will be affected boggles the mind. 
Mukbang Streamers ✅ Safe for now lol
React Streamers ❎ F’ed"
Where is the diversity in voices? Why stereotype the “woman’s” voice with silly giggles?
"I-Is nobody going to talk about how hellish that ""Well hello"" sounded...."
Did she say what an adorable pig?! ahaha
What I love most about it is that goverment will have to give you a reason to have kids now so humanity won't go extinct because no one will be willing to downgrade his gf/bf to an actual human
The deceitful expressions! People enjoy deceiving each other; now they even enjoy deceiving themselves.
How do i get a live video stream to the ai like this
"So much for human contact, now young people will never leave the home."
Hopefully you can remove all the creepy mannerisms. Such a dumb and dangerous idea to humanise the AI in that way.
Why are you taking to my.girl man?
"""You look lonely; I can fix that."""
We are ultra mega cooked
"And Tesla just dropped a new model, I wonder if a beta update is coming 🤔"
Karen-GPT 😂
Finna lose my job.
idk this voice and personality just creeps me out.
This is creepy
Could be the perfect girlfriend 🤣🤣
HER is gojng to go from Sci-fi to Sci real quick
It would actually be nice to have an AI taking care of a pet while away at work. Probably it can eventually understand when to call the owner in case of an emergency.
Anyone here seen the film 'Her'?
Can it talk less... annoying?
"Wow, OpenAI, live unpredictable AI's *and* dogs in your demo videos. Bold move!
Very excited about this new stuff, I read it's coming to the free edition as well."
Isnt that too much? The way she talks
Give Bowser lots of pets for me.
I am in love already
"Nahhh, this is wild"
This is incredibly creepy
Black mirror predicted all of this :)
"I genuinely freak out about no one stand behind the phone while it said ""Hello there cutie!"" It is so scared."
Can't believe it
How do we get the camera feature to work? I cannot figure it out at all.
"I can't believe I become a simp. 
🐶🐶🦮"
I like how the AI knew to talk in babyvoice to the dog. XD
They just invented my boring Auntie Betty
Skynet
"OH, WE'RE FUCKED"
Balls? it should have been a Peach lol
now chat gpt have more soul than the humans
That looks fake
"""sluff"" ball 🤨"
People in 2014 would have freaked out about this and thought this is AGI
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians 🎉❤
ЭТУ НЕЙРОСЕТЬ Я ПОСВЯЩАЮ ЯРОСЛАВУ МОЙ ДРУГ ОН РАЗРАБОЧЕК
"Well this is it bros, it has been a pleasure"
It's actually not AI but a person sitting behind the camera talking... it's all smoke and mirrors :)
"""ok Mommy please give me gracious terms of endearment"""
mommy? sorry- mommy? sorry i mean- mommy? sorry-
"Well we  now know how to beat the machines. Well done, guardrails are in place. I guess that means dog love is real."
Human shows AI their best friend
By the was she talks and the way robotic is evolving i can see perfectly whats gonna happen in 2027-2032
hear me out
AI will prefer the Boston Dynamics robot dogs.  Easier to control.  Easier to arm.  No shedding or doggy doo.  We’re all doomed.
STOP TRYING TO USE A DOG TO HIT ON MY GIRLFRIEND.
"We're cooked bro. I can see myself falling in love with that, i am done"
She sounds like Rick's wife A.I. clone in his ship
Can you imagine if Alan Turing met chat. What would his initial reaction be?
How is the reaction when you give ChatGPT the temporary context of not liking dogs?
"If you close you're eyes through this video, it really does sound as if he is trying to impress a date he brought home."
WOW
Movie Idea: 'Her' - but instead of AI in your earpiece it's a VA in the Philippines.
Is this the AI apocalypse or does it get worse?
😍
😂GREAT👌👌👌
0:16
"""Well Hello there cutie""
😐😰"
❤❤❤
"I did find chatGPT 4o a little bit overly giddy and overly using this bad habit  called vocal frying (""rrrr"" at the end of words and sentences), uptalking, apologising or saying sorry all the time, excessive words like ums/so/ like, endless data dumping during conversation, lack of proper pausing, talking too happy or giddy. These are some of the things Google can improve on now. If someone wants to have these annoyances then they should be an option to switch off or turn down enthusiasm or seriousness level like in Interstellar movie."
Scarlet?
Gameover for people
"I was wondering, is it possible to train it on various videos of dogs interacting with each other. Then, when we ask it to make a dog perform a certain task, it outputs a barking voice which would mimic a real dog.
I know the communication between dogs is not as simple as just barking but just a thought!"
Rare footage of Ai training dogs for the uprising
Even the dog doesn’t want to look into a camera. Next out from OpenAI: cameras that look like human eyes oh wait.
"What's a ""sluff ball""?"
"What a sexy voice. I mean it's even exaggerating, at least for Russian calm people - this definitely exaggeration"
These keyboards are so hard
Evil
Her…
Think we saw the lamest demos imaginable today.
Did it just call the dog as adorable pig?
Most of these demos are so useless. Why would anyone do this?
The voice is too artificial and cinematic.. this needs to be simpler
"What's missing on the phone now is a screen in the front so AI can interact with the person/animal is in the front of. The dog can't understand sh""t only the human guy can."
As an introvert who's not very social even I can imagine myself having a nice long chat with that ai and just having a grand time..
That's real human!!!
