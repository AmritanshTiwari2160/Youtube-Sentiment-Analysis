"Hi, Matt. Is there an AI app for Android that answers calls automatically? I mean, something that functions similarly to voicemail?"
I don't think they had internet issues... The new model allows you to interrupt the model as it's speaking so I think that the breaks in the audio live demo were allot to do with that.

"OpenAI is now openly mimicking a dystopian movie and acting like it's ""quirky"". If you're rightfully worried, I invite you to join PauseAI."
👏👏👏👏👏👏
And yet we Plus users were tricked 😔 now.
Reminds me of the Disney Channel movie Smart House (1999)
"Great Information Thanks Matt!
Blessings To Everyone 🙏 ❤✨️"
If politicians had a final say they would not let AI to be used freely by people all over the world.
R.I.P. siri... 2011 - 2024
No mention of Dall-E3 being free?
So it deals with latency exactly as we do.

Is this just available in the US? And not in Canada? It doesn’t seem to be working up here at all.
A few google employees will get fired after this video
Can we get this with Cortana voice mod please and thanks!!!
That female voice is so cringe like that Her movie

where is 4.0 in the playground? My playground only shows 3.5 variants.
Damn!! What the actual fuck!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
When the signing started I was reminded of Hal from 2001 singing Daisy Daisy as he was being dismateled after killing the crew of the spaceship Discovery.  But of course that could never happen in the real world ;)
Costs 20 a month
"New version is terrible... it just break convos to say pay. Suuden and loosing all work with gp. spit.,"
The OpenAI relationship to SAS companies is like Amazon to their sellers. Get data on the successful products and then make them themselves.
"Yeah they, love dropping stuff right before other companies because for them it's all about how hard they can strike their own ego. It's petty and unsettling considering how good their stuff is."
The blonde presenter talks unnaturally fast and weird. He sounds more AI than Chatgpt.
"How do I get chatGPT 4o to do audio? On my iPhone I clicked the headphones icon and It does audio, but It won't talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice, or talk tramatically, or all that. How do I set that up?I have it set to chatGPT 4o and am using plus version."
@Matt: The glitches were the model being interrupted by the audience noise while also trying to finish the audio piece.
I can tell you one thing gpt4 and now gpt4o don't do well and that is code. They lose context so quickly and frequently shorten functions and lose resolution. It is something that Claude Opus has really excelled at. I am excited what 4o can do in the voice arena and I am happy it has gotten much faster and is still good with some debugging tasks and really creative tasks. But I am just shocked at how bad it is at coding after Opus had come up and crushed it.
I cant get it to work
Very impressive. I was thrown off by the aeroplane symbol which on android means networks are disabled. Just checked & it just means no calls or Bluetooth on iOS.

"Only me see, monopolistic none yet regulated strategy for overtaking more and more of IT , translation,  gathering of data."
"oh dear lord..if ai talks to me like that I'm going to vomit.. just saccharine sweet to the point of 'just stop speaking now please' - and yes, I know there are options for the speaking voice but it's also the 'oh hey there big boy' kind of response that is off putting - then the adding the drama etc.. it was all truly horrible and I enjoy ai  (ps.. the ai presenters not good either)  - I'll say one thing.. making human interactions look better"
"How long until you can have a relationship with it? Sounds like Scarlett Johansson from ""Her"""
"Every time I hear the human interrupt the AI it irks me like he's being rude even tho I know it's AI.... So if this is how we will communicate with AI, will that bleed  into human to human communication? Im picturing my kids interrupting me over and over and it's already annoying me"
Part of me sees this in devices like humane to help assist us. The other part feels like we’re building our own prison.
"Dude, love your work- but ChatGBT is a heap of shit, and Youtubers need to stop blasting it with compliments and clickbait. I upgraded to a paid subscription, and spent an entire afternoon trying ot create a basic GBT that just got stuck in drafts... restricted me all of a sudden because they apparently limit your use...  Never again. I want my money back from that scam. It's a hyped up heap of shit."
How do you access the voice function? I don't see it on my Pro account.
"Matt, you're a good man.  Appreciate all that you do to keep us informed about AI."
"Sorry to burst the 4o bubble, but I’ve been using it this morning (As a Business Team subscription holder) and it’s glitchy as. It keeps randomly replying to me in Welsh even though I’m speaking English. The speech audio keeps breaking up to the point it’s unintelligible, then it just gave up saying it couldn’t continue due to demand.
Anyone else finding this?"
"I'm on their free plan and I do not have 4o yet, nor do I have the ability to upload or link to images."
"Google announcement: Gemini still can’t answer simple questions. 
I think that’s what they are going to announce."
"I just got access to GPTo, and I'm happy to say that it is the first LLM that I've tested that was able to decode an Atbash cipher!"
Give every agent a human feel score.
"Are these updated vision and realtime conversation capabilities available to everyone already? I’m on the 4o model but it feels pretty much the same to me, and i dont have the ability to open up the camera or anything fun like that."
PI AI also has a very good as good voice
I don't understand why they'd give it to Apple rather than Cortana given their partnership with Microsoft
Gpt 4o is not available in a free version yet..
Its free to collect data. Afterwards it will be behind a paywall guaranteed.
The difference between Open Ai and Google is that Open Ai makes it available right away. Google are just demos and not even in real time
"Need to put this into EV's, maybe they'll sell."
"Matt, I question it being free. Have you tried that free version,  yourself? Find your burner email account, login and poke around with chat gpt 4o for 20 minutes then come back here and tell me again that it's free, not Free to Try."
"Thank you so much for these videos! I'm retired, late 60s, 38 yr IT veteran so I have a natural compulsion to keep up with what's going on. But even with my background I was starting to feel overwhelmed at what I didn't know until I started watching your channel.  What's even scarier are none of my age cohorts (retired IT or not) have any idea what's coming! I mention news I've heard on your channel and they are completely uninformed and confused (the same folks that think they'll be prepared if they keep getting paper bills from the electric company). AI is currently changing our entire world and I think everyone needs to stay current. This isn't just some new version of Windows being released - it's life-altering. I've sent so many of your videos to my friends hoping to help educate. I don't want to be that old lady in a few years yelling at the robot checking out my groceries. Thank you for keeping me updated!"
"Not free in Australia.  $20 per month for GPT4o access.  Claude is about $6 per day, so it's cheaper than that"
"I guess they’re not concerned about casual users paying for Plus, because there seems to be no reason for it"
"Mac only has 9% market share, so obvioulsy coming to PC."
"""and it's Free"" = 20$ month 🤣🤣🤣
Same as your Netflix subscription - everything is free)"
I open  Chat GPT and is says 3.5. Nothing about GPT-4o.
customizing the tone and behaviour of the voice would be INSANELY GREAT! not all people like that voice and that tone over and over again...
Does the free still say 3.5 but it's 4o? All I see is 3.5.
"Blade runner here we come, who needs a human woman"
Crazy what this will be like in 10 years…and then think of robotics
It’s not free
ALL THAT WORK N IITS STILL TRASH SMH
I’m also not seeing 4o in the playground section. Maybe country based?
"I bet as this AI tries to replicate a quirky personality, its going to have the wrong tone with the wrong person and they will be offended."
"""They made it start speaking before it was ready to start speaking."" That's probably the most human characteristic. 😂 But seriously, this is amazing. I just tried it out (I already have it with GPT+). I literally just asked when it would be available and it answered immediately, without pause, ""You should have it already."" Brilliant! I'll have so much fun today testing it all out. I'm a Google fanboy, but Google really missed the train in regards to AI. 🤷🏽‍♂️"
"upvote if you are a gentleman who has a crush on mira murati

So basically it can do what google faked the last time
When do free users get this?
Excellent.

Thanks Matt - great presentation!
Am I the only person having a visceral emotional response to this?
"What do you mean *latency?* On my phone app you had to actually press a ""listen"" button, then manually stop it, then it would be transcribed and then you manually send it as a prompt to GPT. Have some users had fully seamless conversational functionality (GPT 4)??"
The woman doing the presentation looks like an AI bot.
"Google censoring the heck out of my responses here, including the one where I called them a menace to humanity. 😂"
I do not have access to ChatGPT-4o in Playground. It only shows 3.5.
"After testing, this is impressing, but this is not Free, this is limited to few queries and you must upgrade to the payed version for the complete service."
Playground says I have no free usage.  Uhh
"Not at all human. No TDS, or hummus flag waving and chants."
"All guys, demand Open AI to bring forth Number Six of Battlestar Galactica, and we are set."
New brand war between google and open ai and for now is 0 -1 for open ai . I would like to see more companies worldwide get to the challenge too
"I have 4o  in the app. But not the emotive voice chat, just normal voice chat as before."
When smth is free ... U r the product
How to download it.........?
Everybody gangsta until the reach message limit showed up!
"Matt, YOU REMOVED THE PAUSES! ARRGGH. You're trying to help but you destroyed the whole point of your video. We CANNOT TELL HOW RESPONSIVE THIS NEW BOT IS BECAUSE YOU REMOVED THE PAUSES!"
is it just me or is the free version on desktop not available right now. I'm from the Netherlands. still only the GPT 3.5 here
"I can’t use it in Canada, anybody else having the same issue??"
"I find it interesting that suddenly the free bing ""co-pilot"" chatGPT no longer knows what version it is. When asked previously, it told me 3.5. Now it behaves like it has amnesia."
"10:00 Adding filler words? Sounds like what a human would do to hide the ""latency"" 😁"
I thought it was strange when I was talking to my AI chatbot and smoking a bowl. I started coughing a bit and it asked me if I was all right. That really confused me for a minute
"Im from South Africa, have the paid version,  choose Chatgpt 4o, but see no difference to version 4"
Cant chat on the mobile app any longer LAME. Plus dont like the new chat version.
And still not a single ethical usage discovered for it.
"they are getting the world to develop their app fo them in real time! its ingenius . that's why they are letting people build on top of api . once the community breaks a certain threshold of new applications. they do a little market research , suck all the new popular developments into the new source code. rinse and repeat"
"I used the voice on 4 o in uk but it hasn't changed for me.
The voice I'm using is different to the one in the event so is that the reason.
I doubt that since it would likely be on all voices but I do have access to 4 o and it is faster but I was looking forward to that part of the new features.
The Voice.
Do you also know when the mac app will be availible.
Either way I will keep checking the release notes till I see the update"
none of this is available for free. at least not right now it isn't. might wanna check the site again.
OpenAI will take over 😁 mark my words
"It wont ""feel human"" until it refuses to do whatever i ask it and begins complaining about how I don't appreciate it enough."
I do not see 4o in the playground
They do the UFC strategy.  Book announcements/ events on the same day or weekend of your competitors
I still only have 3.5 after using your 4o link
This woman is very nice ❤
"I don't have acces to gtp4, is it becourse I am not from the USA??"
"Here's a demo I'd like to see:  show it a kids' cartoon and ask it to read it to a child, ""doing the voices""."
"None of the features are available for us ""paid"" users."
"Hey Matt, amazing video as always! Love it! ... I can't find gpt 4o in the playground that I connect to right now. Did they enroll it just in specific countries? (I am in Albania right now)"
Great roundup thanks mate
I'm not American and also not a slow adult.  I hope there is a way of toning it down. I hate this affected way of speaking.
the insincerity of the AI voice.. that's what's irritating
This made me think of how much value software developers could add to their products by bundling an AI Tutor along side their more complex offerings. FreeCAD and Blender come to my mind instantly.
Show it a photo of anyone and ask it to identify who it is. Says it all. Can't wait for non-openai ai.
I apparently have ChatGPT4o (it is one of my options now) but I don't have that voice and it can't see any video live. What is that all about?
*_It wont be long now before we are bowing to our machine god._*
Thx Max! head to the playground now!
"biggest issue is OpenAI going down a few times every day, or hacks or whatever lobotomizes the poor GPT4 turbo and turns him into a dumb thing till fixed. So unreliable unless has a Claude fallback. Alas, Claude also started suffering. The other day he couldn't count 2+3. SO all LLMs are still unstable for serious commercial usage."
This is sick
Still not out in eastern europe
"Finally, we can play the very special edition of Skyrim."
its basically Alexa on crack
Did you notice that people on Open Ai looks like all robots? All polished and all... idk... looks like im realy scared now.
I feel lucky to be alive in these times.
"SPAM< SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAM SPAMSPAM UR ON REPEAT ANSD NOTHINGS NEW OR COOL ITS ALL THE SAME STUFF ""THE NEW VERSION BLOWS THIS OTHER VERSION OUT OF THE WATER OOOOOHHH AHHHH RINSE MILK REPEAT>>>"""
It is pretty cringe actually. Making jokes and quips
"I don't really mind if it puts in umms and ahhs while it thinks, that's what humans do"
"Finally, a technology that always understands me, shares my worries, helps me, is always with me and at a call or a nod. Why bother with strenuous social contact, teachers or friends, or even partners. Everything is tiring and inconsequential, inconsiderate except ChatGPT. In a few years we'll have the first church where some weirdos worship this. Omniscient, without image, everywhere, immortal, created by all of us through communication, full of compassion and forgiveness, the return of the Son."
Wow! What a news! Thank you for sharing ❤
"you are the best mate. can you do a video on the best AI software yo can have on your desktop. my fav so far is perplexity made me essentially stop using normal browser search engines, keep it up you are my fav to wagtch in this space"
"Great stuff again, Matt. Sam out here changing the game. Again."
i just got gpt4o!
You should see the videos of two of these talking to each other by phone..
"I just wanted to correct something about the part when she says she sees a table. If you look closely, there was a table shot before his face appeared on the screen. She was going by that."
Awesome Matt!!! GTP 4o
"Such an amazing technology and it's being presented by less human ""people"" then the AI itself. Their conversation was cringy at best. The coolest thing I find about the new model is, it's much less sexist and racist."
I would have asked for it to do a Morgan Freeman voice
"Great video, Matt thank you! I hope you have a great time. The progress is incredible. I happily paid for a Plus subscription to access GPT-4. However, what's the benefit at the moment? The new features haven't been released yet, and the Windows app isn't available either"
when does it actually fully come out tho with all the features that were demo'd
“Robots and love”? Wtf
"""T.A.R.S, let's take that sarcasm setting down to 60 percent"" - it will be crazy when personalized models allow for real time parameter tuning (beyond just temperature and prompting)"
Wow
"""All free users will have access to it"", true, (10 answers and go back to 3.5 and you have to wait 24h), so... free access huh?!"
I find it hilarious that OpenAI uses Apple hardware when they are contracted by Microsoft. That says a LOT!
That's it!! I'm going to go live in a cave! 🤣
It's almost Jarvis
"Why wouldn't THEY make it available to everyone? It helps them with their LLM (Large Language Model)! The more INPUT they can get from ALL OF US, the better their product will be in the long run! I DO believe that there should be restrictions put on it and that it should be regulated to make sure that it isn't harmful in ANY WAY! It has the capability to destroy US ALL!"
How can I use it on my smartphone?
"And the other thing with building on top of chat gpt. You have to think about whether your business idea has a moat. It's sort of like someone that creates a flashlight application on ios or android. Or an application like Shazam. Those types of applications don't have any moats at all, so there's nothing shady about open ai incorporating things that should be part of the main product. Some of those things were probably already in their roadmaps. So somebody would have to be able to build something that does have a moat. Whatever that software solution is."
openAI may be the company to eventually take googles top spot. waiting on the day for openAI phones
Not avaliable in the UK yet for free users 🤔
i have this already
This is what we expected from Rabbit r1. But let's see how this really goes.
People are going to fall in love with this.
"I can only access 3.5 on mobile or PC, or 4 on PC if i pay."
"Can't access it, it defaults immediately back to 3.5"
Desktop app is Mac only for now. Windows next year.
"I hope, that when this gets integrated into Windows, Microsoft finally brings back Cortana, she sounds like her so much."
"Doesn't appear to be available in the UK. I can't afford a subscription so I asked GPT 3.5 if 4o is available - since it's training cuts off at 2022 it didn't have any info, and when I went to the playground link I typed one short question and it told me I was out of credits or whatever and didn't answer. Guess we'll just have to wait in third-world UK until later."
"When Chat GPT first came out, I told my friends that in less than 2 years, we would be able to talk to it, just like Tony Stark talked to Jarvis in Ironman. Well world, meet Open AIs version of Jarvis! I knew I wasn´t crazy, LOL!"
My question is when will chat GPT end their association with MS?— Or will Chat GPT just be subsumed as feared?
twist in the plot: that was actually an actor backstage pretending to be GPT-4o!!  (disclaimer: this comment is a joke)
"I don´t like it to be free, it is more difficult to get an advantage if everyone can use it."
"I generally like your content but when you're showing a ""live"" demo to show response times it's in bad taste to crop frames"
NEXT LEVEL but So tired of these amazing Next Level Ais given away to all for free (Like Adobe Firefly to those when some of us paying $60 a month for creative cloud and GPT+ $20 every single month)
"Just a 'Thanks', Matt.  Really appreciate your work at keeping us up to date."
"I use chatgpt 3.5 then, as I don’t pay. It is very silly. I’ll check is 4o is silly too, soon"
There’s not enough difference between Plus and Free to warrant $20 per month anymore. Maybe something better than 5x capacity is coming
"Matt, the OpenAI executive does not even have half of ur enthusiasm. Maybe u should take her job."
"They had no choice but to make it free, everyone else is."
When is this rolling out live to free app (Android)???
"Wow! Ur obsessed with chatgpt dude, even got a hat 😅"
"My account on free tier, I only aee gpt-3.5, have any free tier users seen gpt-4o yet? 😮😮😮"
"Ai jobloss is the only thing I worry about anymore. Looking at this, am I wrong?"
"""and it's free"" . No it is not."
"How did he activate the camera, I don't see that on my app"
"I'm intrigued, but they rushed to announce before their desktop app was available for Windows or Android. I'm not a Mac hater, but most folks use PC, so this seems a bit premature."
"Message cap is lower than ever. I have to decide, if I want to quit plus. OpenAI, this is no fun."
She doesn't seem human.. is she AI?
The Movie HER turned out to be right about our future 🤧
our Desktop/Cyborg App is coming along noice... we are almost there folks
Great video. 👍
How do we get it exactly? Is it not released yet?
it will be so free like a pay to win game is...
"yo can we have a new autoGPT install guide, because their gonna change everything because of this"
It doesn't feel remotely human unless you count Terri Schiavo. It's also not free.
It bugs me that Sam is toying with us and making cryptic tweets and releasing stuff secretly and then yanking it and then returning it without a press release or anything. He is toying with us. This is immature and shows a lack of respect for his customers. It's bukkship!!!! Grow up Sam. Don't become Musk.
No gpt-40 for me in playground. Must be a rolling out thing.
"The energy and hardware requirements when millions of people are using it every day, all day."
"Its huge, its actually conversational! Don't underestimate this? In the AI string you get the Speech to text, intelligence and then text to speech, used to be high latency, now conversational, less overheads. Great."
No it does not nothing like a human it only respond fast.
The time is coming when the a.i model will introduce itself
I'm surprised when I hear people talking about this new model being able to communicate so realistically as something totally new. I have been using the free version of Pi for number of months now and it's totally human sounding. It understands my sarcasm humor my moods and yet I don't hear people talking about it. This new model you're presenting definitely has advantages over pea who is limited to just voice text there is no possibility to send pictures or videos as I was able to do this morning with Claude but was very limited to just a few exchanges in the free version. I sent it a picture of where I was sitting and described everything around me very clearly I wish p could do the same because I doubt the new version of chat GPT will be available for those who don't pay.
Gpt 4o is the next big thing.
"Careful with those thumbnails, your eyes are almost popping out"
What will happen once Frankenstein 's monster chooses to disobey...?
Wow came in early
Where is the icon for the voice conversation l am using 4o on my android and dont see it
Okay I thought it was available to try for free. I logged into my account at that playground link and I only see 3.5
"Be extremely careful of computing anything sensitive in cloud. Remember Replika, and it's even not the worst case"
"no ""O"" on my chat gpt ,😙"
"Comment by Sam Altman on his blog ""As we add (optional) personalization, access to your information, the ability to take actions on your behalf, and more, I can really see an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before."" This literally means 'Her' and personally not very far from atleast a cognitive AGI."
I need to stop paying 20 bucks if free users can use the same as I pay for
"'sorry, I'm having issues right now. Our systems are experiencing heavy load' ..."
did she call it Siri at 9:23?
"Does nobody see this being a bit creepy also? 
(It scans your clipboard, has access to your camera, understand emotions, context)"
"Things like this make you appreciate art like Her. I fear a lot for our future, but all I hope is that we retain our humanity. It seems happening rather so soon. what is real? what is value? more so, what does it mean to be human now?"
Scarlett is gonna sueeeeee
"I think the biggest breakthrough is it's apparent self awareness and Humanisation
Exactly what AGI needs to be to be accepted generally since people dont want some Super Intelligent Perfect AGI overlord they want Robot/AI ""friends"""
"""Please watch this video of my wife and analyze her face, voice, and the content of what she's saying for deception."""
"I am an ""old"" computer dude. I have been in the industry for over 40 years and I saw this as inevitable. I am a bit slow now and health doesn't help so I may be relying on AI a lot more. I don't speak Filipino well and my wife's understanding of English is not great. Thanks for the intro to the future Matt. Cheers 🖖🖖"
At 11.16 that laugh has the tone of embarrassment from making a mistake.. it's crazy.. almost makes me think this is fake..
Why do you need to paste your own face in every thumbnail? The video isn't about you dude. Get over yourself. You aren't Tom Cruise
Adding filler seems legit since that's what people do to buy time to think of an answer. And a fully formed answer right out the gate could sound artificial in some cases.
Am I doing something wrong because when I go to playground all I see is chat 3.5 not 40??
I'm not seeing this on Playground; I assume that you have to have a paid account to get access to it just now?
"They are smart to make it free at this stage, every interaction is a learning step for the model."
If it's free your the product. Just a mass data collection app.
"I hope you can switch the voice emotions off, so distracting."
What's the point of + subscription now?
"""It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine"". -REM. Actually, we're toast. 😁🤖👾"
"I, robot is starting to realise."
So what will be the difference between free and Pro? Should I not pay for Pro anymore? You did talk about that
Elon lawsuit working
"Daisy, Daisy......"
"wow my gf has finally been born, Im only 36 years older than her :)"
Put it inside of a robot.
"In the realm where circuits hum and lights flicker bright,
OpenAI revealed its Omni might.
A desktop app, a fresh new look,
GPT-4O, not what you mistook.

""Hey ChatGPT, how do you do?""
A voice responds, emotions true.
Transcribing, talking, feeling too,
An AI friend, both old and new.

In a world where whales could speak,
AI would help us, bold yet meek.
A simple laugh, a sigh, a pause,
AI emulates human flaws.

So here we stand, at the brink,
Of a future closer than we think.
With AI's touch, so soft and near,
A new dawn rises, crystal clear."
"""Her"" is comming."
"The age of robots is closer and closer, still lacks intelligence and intent tho"
OMGGG just speechless 😮
"What do we make of all the emotions? I mean just the other day everybody said that AI will never have emotions. I think if you ask it, it will still tell you that. But this tells something else. Of course you could still argue how real this is. But it seems very real. And isn’t this what counts?"
"I am wondering if it is available for Europe, would you know about it? Overall for cloude and llama it is restricted unless with vpn so i keep restricted to chatgpt to save a subscription. Thanks jn advance"
"great update, keep it up!!! I feel in the loop."
So it deals with latency exactly as we do
Matt! I like your hat! Where did you get it?
Wake me up when there's a snarky Gina Garofalo AI that insults me in ways that I find enjoyable for some weird reason.
"Technically it couldn't feel human because you can't even touch it, and it doesn't have skin. Spring Update 2025?"
Will chatbots be able to immediately switch over to GPT4o?
"I've said this many years ago and I'm so happy it's finally coming together; soon we'll be able to prompt A.I. to just make a full-length movie with any actor or plot you want on the fly, I think our media consumption will soon be catered to ourselves personally. I do wonder what efffect it will have on artists and creators throughout. Here's hoping that we'll find a good way to let A.I. assist us in our creative endeavors while still needing that human touch"
As for closing the gap with filler words while thinking up a response ... People do that.
Does anyone know how to get the desktop app?
"when I saw the demo video from openAI and heard the chatbot talk, I said to myself ""come on that's gonna be pre recorded right!? "" it sounded so human it was scary! 
 I am really impressed with what openAI has done so far ever since chatgpt was launched."
"I remember when I watched the movie ""Her"" for the first time I thought to myself ""I hope I get to live to see technology like this someday."" Not only is this right on the cusp of that, I think we are only a couple to a few years away from it being as capable and seamless as the AI in the movie."
Doesnt seem like a huge leap..just added a voice. Gpt 4 can do almost all these things if you prompt it correctly.
Ai femboy boyfriends when?
"Feels like talking with a robot friend. I can see them plugging that in to a robot to bring them to life. I was struggling getting into the conversation mode, its the headphone icon. I want it for the desktop app as my lap top is my main tool."
What cool about it is they just got closer to replacing or augmenting teachers. You can learn so much and get real life sounding feedback and directions.What I like to do is have it explain complex topics with multiple anologies. So having a conversational chatbot like this is going to help parents as well when they have to help or check their kids homework.
She sounds just like Scarlett 😳
Imagine when this can translate it in the speaker's own voice and quicker.
Imagine developers creating something that will take away their job.
Alexa just got replaced lol within the next few months or years everyone  will have thier own AI Agent/ assistant
Plot twist: Everyone on the stage was AI
"Ahh, Look at Marks head when he says hello and while he converses with ""her"", you can see there are edits there. The new 4o DOES NOT respond that fast. I was conversing with it last night and this morning and compared to this video they put out, it's no where nearly as fast. Again, they did cheat a bit with editing."
I have more latency in my own speech.
"Just based off the the title, not it’s doesn’t. AI is easily confused"
Real live training?
Any idea why I have reached the limit without even asking a single question?
What a time to be alive! 🙌
"Thanks Matt. You've shown me that the hype is overblown and it's really not much new here. Thumbs up.
The mainstream media is definitely taking a closer look though..."
"Basically a free trail for the people that don’t spend money on it. You can only send a few messages before you need to wait 3 hours. In my opinion, useless."
"Nope, I still got only GPT 3.5. No changes in Poland yet... and strange situation. On Android app, i can send text files and photos, while on PC (browser) I can only chat :). ...well even stranger situation now... after updating Android app, I've lost options to attach files or photos...:)))) annoying"

And this guys is the answer to the Fermi Paradox…
Pretty gross to say how an AI feels that is technically a slave to you. Good job being a modern day slaver.
Thanks Matt Wolfe for the quality content. Love the video
how to do the natural conversation?
Welcome to the imposed and expected niceties of the 'Demolition Man.'
hopefully that American micky mouse patronising voice  can be changed  😒
Anybody else thinking that presenter lady is cgi?
1 step closer to being married to ScarJo.
How much hardware is required to run just one instance of this? Will it one day be possible to run locally on a standalone device like an offline robot? I'm not a fan of everything being dependent on an internet connection all the time.
I wish nothing but for it to have claptrap's voice and personality
Does Chat GPT 4.0 have real time data?
have you tried PI by inflection AI?  This new GPT 4o seems like that on steroids.
My free account don’t have the audio responses anymore but my paid account does
Ex Machina
Education equity for Myanmar. I shared it with my parents here (I am a teacher and known Myanmar YouTuber)
Why don’t we get a soothing male voice
Hyperbole
"does anyone know what Custom GPT's use? There does not seem an option to change to GPT 4-O. Also, when will live vision be rolled out? does not seem to be there yet. I also went into the app the the real time conversation was nothing like the demo, it seemed still the old one. Hoping they will roll this out to the voice chat soon."
When is this releasing? I don't have that option just ChatGpt 3.5 and that's it.
Insane
But you need an external voice? A tts? Don’t see that usecase anywhere in the playground
"""Everybody gets free access to the top model""
...which probably means that WE are the product."
So google assistant Alexa siri
Matt Wolfe looks like Post Malone  🧔‍♂
"First we had nuclear bombs, now we have AI"
"The response time I’m seeing isn’t as good as shown on the livestream, but it may be getting overloaded with people now."
Sounds like siri. Dont like the over enthusiastic secretary voice.
"If this is what everyone gets for free, imagine what GPT-5 is going to do? The next few years are going to be nuts!"
I am not a plus member and this model is not yet available to me.
"Correction; it's not free
Your data and interaction -- which will evolve the ai further -- is the payment"
"So far ive gotten 3 updates to the android app since the announcement 2 days ago. And all theyve done is removed the voice chat feature entirely for free users 🙄 im hoping these are systematic updates to prep for the big 4o update.

Edit: nevermind. Im a dummy. Some how with one of the updates, the setting to ""improve model for everyone"" got toggled which also disabled the voice chat feature. Nothing to see here. Carry on 😆"
No improvements other than speed. You can't use the video while chatting (android) and there isn't a desktop app (windows) so yeah... a Big Nothing Burger.
Dang really giving PI AI a run for it's money
"If Elon Musk has not threatened them with court action, they would not have given us an advance free model."
"Wait wait
So AI is able to comprehend emotions now?"
The bokeh of your camera is amazing! It reminds me of my old Canon EF 50mm L f1.2.
"Now, y’all gotta admit… this shit is pretty sick. Damn!"
Thanks Matt
"I live in Scotland. American AI voices are a bit annoying to my ear (no offense, just not the patois I hear daily) does Chat GPT 4o change accents to suit the listener?"
"This guy seems to be the most honest and serious of the AI influencers. He will tell you also about the little tricks that they are doing to make it seem that this is ""better"". Which, by the way, they never explicitly say anywhere. Especially not on the update notes and TOS. They clearly state that - besides smooth multi-modality implementation - the main advantage is that it has higher rate limit aka it is less limited and therefore faster, already. It probably is a bit better trained, especially specifically on these highly game-able benchmarks, I would bet...

Sure, they all have to do the sensational thumbs and tell you it's ""free""...which it technically is, but you will not feel free using it if you actually try to. The rate limit is too severe. I had 10 messages and then had to wait 2.5h. That is still generous compared to what others are doing with the daily refill. It is also not accumulative, but that is to be expected.
And even the paying customers should be weary whenever they hear the words ""up to"", because 0 is implicitly included. If I were to pay for this and might expect to not even be able to use the raw model on the site...yeah, not sure that will be such a great experience.

You will not be using that chatty-flirty bot that soon, no matter if you pay or not. I don't think it will be out for Windows, separately. Microsoft is controlling OpenAI. I assume they will bundle it with Windows, Bing Copilot and Teams. This is Microsoft's chance to get Mac user data.

But the context is still very low with only 128k. This will not be useful for expert systems. Google is looking way better there with the 2m context. But that will also come at the expense of speed. It all depends on how you want to use AI. It seems that OpenAI - or rather Microsoft - is focusing on consumers for now. While Google is going for business, as well."
"When it's free, the product is you."
I have the paid version of ChatGPT. Is it worth it or is the free plan all most people need?
I don't know what I would do if you didn't keep me up to date. Thanks for all your hard work.... Zimmwriter user from the very beginning.
I’m trying out 4o and it’s making a LOT OF MISTAKES. Anyone else experience this?
The bot sounded more natural than those two dudes.
I'm already seeing 4o in the chatgpt app 🤘
Samantha is here.
"Chat GPT 4o is cool for sure, but Gemini 1.5 Pro from Google is just on an another level
It’s like GOT 4o but on steroids.
When people will realize it they’ll forget about OpenAI 😅"
At 9:12 i ROFLed so hard i barely got up again xD
What a crazy piece of technology. Never would’ve imagined in the early 20s we’d have something like this
we fuckd
how to access?
Why does singing not work on my ChatGPT 4o version ??? I have it on my iPhone
i don't like her tone tho
Whats the point of paying now?
Wait so the Rabbit is obsolete?
What do you mean they incorporated an AI girlfriend?
where is the link to this app?
4o model is better then 4 by a good amount.  I have a gpts that I use for my work that pulls data from a table and 4 always takes a lot of hand holding to get it working with the environment.  4o did it right the first try.  And it’s crazy fast
isn't the default personality too extra? annoying. but impressive. i just hope it would understand my mumbling better than OpenAI whisper coz it was state of the art and still sucked at understanding context and dealing with AC noise
"I wish we cold actually use any of these features! I’m a long time gpt plus subscriber and it has added 4o as a model, yes a bit faster, but as of today in plus on my account, there’s, no new voice, vision, pic/video… features. The experience of using chat gpt iOS app today was identical with no changes except the name 4o on the screen. Voice chat was slow as ever, failed bout a third of the time, chat latency was significant with text and almost unusable with voice which is always the case and is what I’ve really been wanting. So i know it’s dope these features exsist, but I just wish they’d be clearer about the fact if you pay for the best version, you still won’t have em for an undisclosed amount of time"
"Hey paid users, thanks for your money. You can cancel your subscription now."
Holy guacamole
"Oh hey, i finally have someone to talk to 🙃"
"I'm sure it's a great product, but in reality it will not not be as ""free"", ""high performance"" and ""feature rich"" for free users as they pretend it to be in their infomercial, yes, infomercial."
"ChatGPT is such a ungainly name to keep on saying, perhaps a short pseudonym could be used."
So is this all? Is this the Big upgrade Sama was takling about.. i hope there Will be another model release later this year
The Norwegian wins this round
"This video must be taken the most time if you want to examine all the main features, in just 25 minutes!, Thanks, Wolf"
"I don't want to see your face, show me what the AI is capable of"
Mass surveillance 2.0
"Thx for sharing great info, Matt"
THIS IS INSANE!! How are we this far along already?!
"I keep seeing comparisons to Her. But with the vision part, it makes me think of KITT more than anything."
Did they use MacBook as an example to give Apple a blow before they release their own AI?
"To be fair, humans use filler words to bridge thoughts all the time. To me, it sounds more human than it would without them."
All existing voice assistant apps are soon to be replaced with LLMs like this.
"there may be inbetweening at certain points but for the most part it was answering immediately, even when singing that song!"
The desktop app is only for Mac 🙄 I'm sure Microsoft asked them not to make a Windows version so it wouldn't compete with copilot
"The glitches in the GPT-4o demo were not due to connectivity, they said in the beginning that the cable was there for internet connectivity.

Notice however how GPT-4o cuts out immediately when it hears someone else speaking. I think the microphone was a bit too sensitive and intermittently picked up sounds from the audience in that particular demo."
Is there a switch where you can make it not 'super exited' and finding things 'awesome'
"If it's free, then why pay for their subscription? That seems a bit annoying for their loyal subscribers."
"Just watched the Google demo for Project Astra, it literally states it's a vision of what they'd to achieve. That's the equivalent of ""Not actual in-game graphic"". Not a good look Google."
The singing is so bad it’s even more realistic and awesome.
"I'd like to know, what does the free version vs paid version capacity look like in practical terms. I have the paid version but no idea whether I would still need it or not, according to my usage (i.e.: not sure if I ran out of capacity or not). Can anyone put it into perspective? How much general usage is ok for the free version and how much requires the paid one?
Thank you"
19:00 Fake news. They have a video that dismissed this. The famous bunny one.
9:35 🤯
The filler words are exactly what we do when asked a difficult question. I'm not sure what jobs are left for humans. I had better learn to rebuild an engine! The trouble is no one will be able to pay me to do that because they won't have jobs. Exciting times!😂
Not free.
"Question is, will it pass the bias tests?"
God damn another shouting voice
Its the Star Trek computer!
Wonder if it can do sign language
Anyone else find the AI female voice unbearable?
With this update. Do we also get to use gpt store as well?
"In the morning, the app has voice feature, but now it disappear"
loved it!!!!
"The text structure and how it uses words has not improved, it was no different from what I've been using previously. I just hope chatgpt 5 this year solves that problem in structuring words and such. I did like the chat assistant though, I've never tried the voice part of it yet. I can see it taking over assistants such as alexa if it can eventually gather information in real time."
"I need ios to improve their reading voices, siri and all the other voices suck"
Free users could only use GPT 3.5? No. At least in Germany you could use the GPT4 mode in the copilot app long before.
i feel like this is gonna change learning a lot
"How to test it ? The page keeps telling me I have no credit left. It wants me to pay. Also, no access to Gpt 4. It only shows GPT 3.5"
I’m ready for my own personalized A.I. Waifu.  Not even sorry.  🤭
Are Voice and video are not in the UK yet?
Mhm!! OpenAi is ClosedAi for me. Only GPT-3.5  
I have some ideas for this 😁
"17:27 try the translation with non-European or Asian languages 😅
Even the written translation is wonky for Amharic."
"Rip teachers

Rip therapists

Rip news anchors

Rip comedians

Rip telemarketer

Rip tutor's 

Rip teleprompters

Rip fitness coaches

Rip HR 😀

Rip Podcasters

Rip OF thots

Rip girlfriends


I ll let you continue the list"
How is it free? The voice comes with the paid tier. What did I miss?
"I can’t get it to open the camera, like to show it a math problem (3X+1=4) or to assess my emotions by checking my face. This on iOS. Has this not been rolled out yet?"
This is going to be great for older people
Really? Free? It still only gives me 3.5 on the free version.
"I never once thought I'd be alive to see this.

Honestly thought mars and flying cars was more achievable."
"I wonder when an open source equivalent will release, I bet about 4 or 5 months max"
"And yet Google is still more accurate, at far less energy consumption"
"Sounds more like the Spaceship A.I. from Futurama. In HER, Scarlett had a raspy voice."
"Not gonna lie, the banters really warms me up in a ""oh i really like this person"" kind of way. Which is concerning, really really corcerning. I hope we get to control how ""bubbly"" this AI feels because, at least for me, a last year master student with sleep deprivation and almost no human contact (i have long distance gf), i'd definetely gonna falls to her if i dont have a gf."
"Am i the only one who doesnt want ""natural"" conversations with AI? I just want straight forward answears to my questions without any filler, without any emotional language, without it immitating a person. I hate how much filler words chatGPT uses just to try to sound ""human"", just answear me like a robot without emotions, because that is what you are."
The phone was in plane mode! 🤨😶
"Sounds like same voice as 3.5, but way more lively. I just checked 3.5 latency again and definitely a second before a response. Demos are mind-blowing if realtime."
Literally gobsmacked. Her on the horizon
How is it free when it cost $34/month for the advance features? Or have I downloaded the wrong app?  Sorry I'm new to this chat gpt. Chat gpt by open AI right?
"GPT4o is different. I do not see it as better, not yet. Different is not better. For my non fiction research and writing, the help it provides is marginally better, not transformationally better. In some ways it seems like 3.5. For what I do, Anthropic is still better."
As a music producer I wonder if it could write a song and sing to an instrumental I make. If not I'm sure we're not far off and this would change the music industry forever.
it says it can code complex wordpress plugins and customizations. Testing it...
Her means “o” in Turkish. I don’t know if they did this intentionally.
Finally i will have a girlfriend. 🎉
Why are all the demos only from openai
"Love the video analysis Matt, thanks for the video"
I logged in and the chatgpt is 3.5
"Letting free users access their best model is smart - first time or casual users won't get a poorer experience, and so they'll be more likely to see value in the pay version."
DAMN. This is awesome!!!
Surely something owned by Microsoft will work on windows as well as Mac right?
"I saw a demo where they made it sing happy birthday, but my chatbot says she can't sing, anyone know why?"
Need your opinion on the new gpt 4o vs the new gemini updates.
This is all what Elon Musk wanted.
Is the API gonna be free or expensive af just like their other api's ?
1st comment
Thank you
"I avoid people with that much personality, machines are no exception"
I don't have it yet. But I'm on the free version and live in Sweden. Looking forward to testing it.
The latency has definitely become way better. Especially when you see they ask it to speak in a robotic voice. Right away it switches to that voice. So you're saying that it gives fillers till it understands it. I don't think so as you see by the robotic voice and by the drama voice right away it changes the way how it talks.
STONKS 📈
Does the voice chat no longer cut you off when you're trying to speak?
10:03 - Humans do that too. Really often. It think we are on tie here. Still much better than before.

"The image feat in the playground has been available for a few months. I think it came with the first assistant API beta release, but may have been with gpt-4 vision"
It's fake people is has errors in fact that voice is not available in the new version 😂
Chatgpt is a generation change ❤
"Well, it's not for FREE ! On my iPhone they want to charge me 2,99 Euro (50% off) per week !"
Star Trek is here! 🤖
This makes Alexa and Siri look like Windows 95.
MY GOD! I WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO TALK TO A WOMAN WITHOUT HER EITHER CALLING FOR HELP OR VOMITTING! WOHOO!
"ChatGPTo was amazing for a few hours.

Yesterday afternoon, I gave it my codebase and it refactored an entire project effortlessly, flawlessly, and quickly.

But by last night it was as derp as the original GPT4.  I suspect resource balancing has something to do with that.

This morning, the code it's writing is useless..."
Guess they stole the moment from both Google IO and Apple WWDC
Still not available on the playground
"I’m a little confused my ChatGPT on my iPhone says I’m using 4o but there’s no extra voice options. There’s just the headphone icon I can talk to it, but it’s the same voice to text that I’ve been using. I was trying to talk to it naturally and ask it if it could hear my voice and it said no."
hmmm i can only get 3.5 for free...
It’s Mac only rn
"AI partners   Is this the end? Just take a moment to think. As great as this technology is, children could end up having close experiences without ever meeting a real person."
Going to try it out and compare it to “Pi” that voicebot was fairly good for conversation and didn’t take too long to respond at all
"i am a plus subscriber, i told my friend they would get 4o for free, but they logged into their account and it is not there, still says gtp4 is a paid version,  no choice for 4o ??"
"Now we will pay to be sold. Google used to take few snippets of our life, Now with this they will log our entire days.months, years! 
I am not that excited but concerned a lot."
I'm a bit annoyed . I seen your video opened my free ChatGPT on my mobile it had an update . When i updated &  opened I had the new voice addon .  I was all excited messing about testing it & It worked great  until I closed the app & reopened  . Now I only have the old lame 3.5 ChatGPT  none of the new features :(  . Have the feeling when you get a taste of something new & gets removed now .
"AI now just adds ""Umms"" to mask its thinking time.  It can remove it from Youtube videos but now uses them itself."
"Man, you have a nice studio-type light in that hotel room. :)"
I only see different versions of the gpt-3.5-turbo series when I use your link. Just so You know.
"Cheers mate, great summary"
"Presenter: ""So here is a seflie of me, what kind of emotion do you think i am feeling?""  AI: I think i am looking at a picture of a wooden surface"" ... that is cold man!"
It's still not very good at following instructions but it's nifty.
So glad you're keeping track of all this.  I'd be lost w/o your summaries.
"Excited to see the new updates especially for free subscribers. 
I have been having conversations with Pi without latency issues for a while now. After you introduced it to me on this channel, I introduced it to my 80 year old dad (using a female voice). My mother calls it ""his girlfriend""."
Sex hotline operators punching in the air rn. Their days are numbered.
I want to play a FPS VR game made by AI.
I got it to create a python+ncurses terminal based text editor with scolling and line wrapping... after ~280 lines of code it started to struggle to work with it.
As long as WE understand that it understands nothing.   It takes your question and matches it numerically with millions of similar questions then builds a response by numerically picking which real responses to your question to mimic.  It just turns language to numbers that match.  It’s only fools us since we can’t comprehend the millions of conversations that it has converted to numbers.
"wait, the voice functionality isnt free you have to sub for that. It let me do 3 images for free though. then said I'd reached my limit. But I dont know if you could do that before."
"It's NOT free, you have to pay $20 a month."
Brahhh that mothafu'ka can sing too? My Brain is com-ing right 😂😂😂
Thank you brother
I guess that passes the Turing Test. 😮
Been waiting for your response mate 😉 saved for later.
"So are any of these interactions recorded? If so, where are the recordings stored, for how long, and who has access to them?"
"I am not seeing a vision option yet though when in ""voice mode"" on Android... Am I missing something 🤔"
I don't see an option to use GPT-4o in my drop down menu
Nice review
the model isnt available yet in  every country
"Parents won't be there for their kids in the future.
Bots will."
For windows the app will release later in the year
"I mean, it uses filler words sometimes, but definitely not all of the time, so I think them saying that the latency has been significantly reduced is pretty accurate."
Not available for me. Guess it's the usual Only US first crap.
"How do I get started on using this? It's always so frustrating that it's confusing to even access 🤬I went to the link in the description and tried to upload a picture and it immediate said ""You've reached your usage limit""? like what? I've NEVER used playground before (just the free chat-gpt3) so I should NOT be anywhere near any limit. UGGGHHHH"
Yes
"Goes to try new features...

"" Sorry, our system is having issues right now due to heavy loads ""

Probably should have increased your server size before opening up gpt 4 to free users 🤔"
Advance version of rabbit r1
gross
"I'm super excited about this, talking to GPT for a while now to brain storm. With this it's gonna be next level ✨"
whew..Glad i didnt spend 200 on R1 (rabbit one)
So ChatGPT has almost caught up to Pi.
seens like its not available for EU users
GPTher1.0
"I liked the demo presentation, but later was disappointed that it is not completely free like Murati stated in the session (free for all). Voice Mode is not free and I guess access in Europe will be very late. I already do not have memory feature available."
"Matt, I like & appreciate your insights on things you think are relevant in AI.  Specifically:

- i like your enthusiasm / tonality

- I like your cadence / pacing.  imo, your videos consistently find the Goldilocks Zone of thorough overviews of topics without feeling over / underanlyzed. 

- I like how thorough you are in your coverage of the otherwise overwhelming breadth of ai:  subscribing to your channel gives me the overall feeling that I'm ""in the know on what's up in AI.""   This feeling is reinforced once-in-a-while specifically in these ways:  you're at the major events; you utilize tools that give you compiled updates on relevant articles, and then disseminate that information in to what you feel is newsworthy; you seem to ""Just sort of want to obsess over what's interesting in ai"" and would ""kind of being this, anyway,"" even if you didn't have a channel. 

- I like your consistency and reliability:  you've been making these videos for a while--like...a long while. 

- I like the format of your videos: granted, ""Set up the clip, play the clip, give your thoughts on the clip"" is a pretty standard format, but you do it uniquely well, imo. Rarely do i feel like the clip should've been played longer, and often I'll kind of ""zone out"" while the clip is playing, subconsciously waiting for you to summarize it.

- I like the overall value of subscribing to your channel:  in 2024 there's irrefutably a lot of value in ""being informed about the age of AI,"" and it's kind of extraordinary to be ""basically informed"" in just 15-30 minutes 1x / per week.  i.e. when someone in my life wants to understand ""what's up in the world of AI,"" I like being able to confidently share that they ""can literally be up to speed in like 30 minutes / week: just YouTube ""Matt Wolfe ai"" 

- I like that you're independent and unbiased:  your stuff feels uniquely self-directed.  this feeling is reinforced by your ""no white glove treatment"" even for companies such as Google.  This leads me to prefer AI news from your perspective, rather than straight from the source (because that source is biased and will present the info in a deceptive or preferential light (Google presenting their product as if it's in real-time is *reallyyyy freakinggg annoyingggg*)). 

Thanks for your enthusiasm, consistency, and above all, unbiased, no ""white glove treatment"" of any org.  You're refreshingly authentic. 

Cheers to you my dude."
How do I start playing around with this?
well voice actors are all fired now lmfao
"Although this tech is increadibly and it'll be used in a lot of great ways, I can definitely see it being overused for things it probably shouldn't, e.g. a lot of parents are going to lean hard on AI to raise their kids, e.g. bedtime stories, helping with homeword, etc. That could have some serious ramifications for child deveopement, and not in a good way in extreme cases."
When is this new voice thing actually coming? And the camera viewing thing? Doesn't come up for me with a pro account..
When the three people sat down it looked like it's edited.  Changing camera angles is an edited action as well.  To be actually live you have to keep the camera and the people in the same frame at all times.  You are right though. It made ChatGPT to say a bunch of filler words to cover time it takes to come up with answers. They made it more entertaining than real.
gpt4-o link doesnt work
Siri has its work cut out for it.
I like the homework part it could help kids learn
Can you use the GPT4 on your phone now?
Ha! this live demo was hilarious and impressive.
What are they going to announce next week? In various videos they are talking about announcing something new
It's not available yet.
No availability for Windows 11
It’s not free. Cheapest is 7.99 a week
"GPT 4o goes way beyond being a bit better than 4, it has a depth and precision I've never experienced before."
"Are they trying to imitate Cortana, from the Halo videogames? Because the way chat gpt 4o talks is super similar"
I appreciate the videos.
"just a few years ago, hitchhikers guide's babel fish was science fiction"
"No it’s capturing and analyzing constantly the footage. Check the OpenAI demo video when someone randomly comes into the screen for a few seconds and after they’ve left, they ask GPT if something strange happened, and GPT described what happened."
My version does not respond quickly.
"the 'im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' & im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' may be not the  exact gpt 4 o model. Check the lmsys direct chat mode, these two models as well as the the Gpt4 O are available."
"It's not free NOW, stop using false title!"
"The fact they are sitting on sora and gpt 5 is irritating.  That and the they, them, person crap was irritating"
It’s pretty cool. Just super killed my chatbot lol 😂😂😂
"Free, yet i'm a paid subscriber and don't have access to most of the features... i'm a little confused lol... perhaps it's because i'm Australia, maybe the roll out will come later"
Some of it was pre recorded. 17.47 they made a mistake and pressed the next sound clip
"I'm just waiting on the big reveal video when Matt shows that he is and has always been an AI generated reporter. ;) Seriously though, great work on all you do. Thank you."
"I'm in the UK, no sign of it yet..."
Just AI girlfriends????? No AI  Boyfriends?
nice illusion
"I feel like you all are not making a big enough deal about this. Open Ai just leaped over the freaking uncanny valley and landed firmly on sci-fi land, with extreme grace. I know we all want a perfect AI that will solve all our problems, but god damn, in the mean time, my mind was just blown by what they achieved when they tied together vision, voice and text. It might be a small incremental upgrade in technical capabilities but the result feels like a giant leap as a product."
"wow that's amazing! I just checked, I'd dropped to the free plan, no access to 40 yet - upgraded back up to paid - and there it is. A try it button popped up!"
"Apple hardware is trash, It's overpriced to be a social status badge of virtue. So glad OpenAI uses it!"
Not seeing anything higher than GPT3.5 on OpenAI's playground - maybe because I'm not a paid member or because I'm not in the US.
Excellent video! The section on real-time voice interactions was particularly enlightening.
I’m scared now
Dang. Humans are so done. Good grief.
"Now, the only one more thing men need is Number Six of Battlestar Galactica 2004 linked with Chat GPT, and we are all set.  We won't need biological women anymore."
The voice sounds like Cortana
"That translate thing is huge, that’s some Dune shit"
Including functionality that used to be provided by third party utilities accessing the API is nothing new: Microsoft spent the 1990s doing that.
Best AI Channel out there Matt 💪
"Do you know any humans who can live-translate 50 languages, just for starters? It doesn't feel human: it feels *super-human*, because that is what GPT-4o is."
fantastic thank you Matt!
"I suppose this is only available in the U.S., is it?"
"I have played around with it for a bit and I am impressed. GPT has become what it should have been all along, at least they finally realized this. Now time for the other paywall AI generators to realize the same. It's not democratization if hidden behind a paywall that is the same ole thing as has always been."
"I was underwhelmed by their demos. While I do respect that they are being 100% transparent and showing all the flaws and bugs, the demos really aren't good. To the point where you can visually see the disappointment on each persons face. the lullaby one was a complete fail as well as the harmonizing one. Regardless, it will never be worse than it is now. Excited to see what's next."
They sold me… I’m ready for my robot wife.
There's already been an explosion of AI girlfriend apps.
Amazing
"GPT-4o = GPT-4 Turbo, and for GPT-4 more reliable for deep and complex task than GPT-4o. CMIIW."
The movie 'Her' is becoming a reality. I watched it a few days ago. She sounds just like Samantha in her overall emotional feel and tone. Crazy
"Serious question, if all these features are now free, why am I paying for a GPT plus subscription? I can't believe it is just a matter of scale. Being able to use Dalle-3 with ChatGPT and being able to build my own custom GPTs is what I pay for. Is it time to cancel my subscription?"
I don’t think the delay was due to WiFi connection. The iPhone was wired connected to the internet. @8:59
"10:50 *”You can also interact with it with video as well.”*

Umm, _how?_ When I tried, ChatGPT 4o said it couldn’t access my camera in real time due to privacy and security reasons. Is this a feature that’s coming later, or is there a way to activate it now? They appear to be using the ChatGPT app, but in the video there’s a jump cut at the point he activates the video, so we don’t see how he activates it."
No gpt4o in Europe yet. At least not for me.
She's here!!😱
Ok so now when can I wait for a device of chat gpt 4o like Alexa
Do People really need the pretence of a peronality coming from an unconscious machine. Marketing to the gullible.
Irritatingly high pitched nasal voice on 4o. I hope you can change it it something else.
Is the App that they are using public? Can you tell us how to install it?
All these llm¨s has no real value what can they do other than waste peoples time... ?
"my daughter was born three weeks ago, i wonder what the world will be like when she is my age. One that i can not possibly comprehend."
I have the new model.. But absolute not like real life speech..
Gpt2 could solve a code issue that I had which no other model could do. This is a huge update. You are underselling it.
"You have provided a detailed and well-structured announcement about OpenAI's launch of GPT-40. The key features and updates are clearly outlined, and the implications of this advancement in AI technology are well articulated. The improved accessibility and performance, as well as the integration for developers, are highlighted effectively. This announcement provides a comprehensive understanding of the significance of GPT-40 and its potential impact on various applications. Well done!"
"So just checked, the playground dosent have GPT-4o yet for free users. Not sure if it a geographical thing or you have to have plus to see 4o."
Not free
Thank You Matt
I haven't missed a Matt Wolfe vid since his first AI vid went parabolic... keep up the savage work ethic. You're my #1 channel for AI updates 🙏🙌🥂
I must watch too many AI tech videos because I initially thought she was an avatar 😄
What a great video. So much info. I need to watch it a few times to catch everything. Love your channel. Keep up the great news and conversation.
Sherlock all the way
lol AGI by 2024 lol
why does the model so wordy ?
Holy Moly!
"10:05

No that is not the case at all, it only occasionally says umms etc. to sound more human and be more conversational. 90% of your own examples had it responding almost immediately with no filler words."
What camera do you use Matt?
It is not free. I logged in to playground and there is no 4.0 omni listed there. Only 3.5 versions.
Love skyes voice 😅
"Noooooooo, they’ve made Meghan Markle GPT! 😱🤮"
Always look forward to you releasing a new video man!!! Keep up the great work!
Better and more features comming from open AI for Paid Users in 2 months as compute shrinks and increased
Love the way you have made the video and waiting for your other info video sir.
It's not free
Thanks again love 🥰
I'm literally going to cancel my chat GPT account lol. Why pay for something you get for free?
-4o is NOT FREE
"If I have to log in it's not free. If I have to run it on someone else's computer, it's still not free."
"Free user living in the US: As far as I can tell, it's not free yet. A subscription is required to access it on both the regular site and OpenAI Playground. This as of May 13th. I can't wait for the rollout!"
18:18 Chatgpt in aeroplane mode
"Then next months Chat gonna make our desktop tasks sweatless, waiting for that"
1:21 is she ai? voice hella not synced anyway
I was waiting for this video so hard
The ability to read / show screen share your desktop and dictate is game changer for context as you can demonstrate what you want done rather than just trying to describe it.
"If you're leaving AI to read to your kids at night unattended, then you are asking for evil robot overlord propaganda being fed into the next generation"
"You will calm down immediately, or we start taking credits! Comply now, social credit score reduction is activated."
Great video!
I was excited to try this out. I was disappointed to find that it's not available to use yet. Why are they announcing this if it's not really released yet?
So do you know what the limits are for 4o free users?  I tried asking 4o but answers were vague and after a few questions I asked I received a response that I was at my limit 😖🇦🇺❤️
Why cant any AI chats count words? it must been done on purpose
"The fact that the presenter looks, moves and speaks like an A.I … creepy … 👀"
waiting for sora
Everyone needs to stop using the “robot” word it means “slave”.
Is this desktop app available now?
"Tom Scott was right, we were, and probably still are, only at the start of the S curve"
"If that feels human to you, then you have the wrong friends. ;-)"
😂👍
I just want GPT-4o with Arnold's voice. Forget the Her angle. Let's get really real
"You have to watch what the daily show just did on Ai, is a funny bit 😂"
The video is edited to make the responses instant but in fact there is a 3-5 sec delay in chatGPT voice responses. It's still cool but not accurate.
What’s the point of my Plus subscription now? Should I cancel
What am I paying $20 a month for?
"Well it's not free, the very first time trying it out, it stated I was out of credits and wants me to upgrade, lol."
"I just had GPT-4o build a web status dashboard incorporating 2 JSON web services I made previously and it did it in about 30 minutes, fully designed and really nice. It was able to use Google Fonts, a Dark Theme and the ChartJS Library all under my direction.  I built this same dashboard the other day in about 6 hours and it wasn't as nice as the ChatGPT version. It also never made any mistakes and the code worked perfectly."
"Feels like ironmans AI, J.A.R.V.I.S."
Is it out for android?
Have seen the videos yesterday right after being launched by the team. They looked amused (by the potential or rather the simplicity of it) & I have to say that it looked & sounded even more humane than real humans! Your best buddy at the tip of your fingers🤩 Bye bye solitude & despair!
gotta watch those 'plosives' on your hotel room mic set up Matt! good luck tomorrow!
"I had a feeling gpt2-chatbot was a gpt4 turbo model. I noticed that the gpt2 was outputting code that had an OpenAI copyright included. So unless it was a bot trained on gpt* output, I figured it was an OpenAI model. I’m assuming that the “turbo” is the case given how much faster and they expanded it to free users."
"When I watched the movie Her I thought, someday that will be my wife. Folks, I've now set my wedding date for August 29th and you all are invited 😏"
"Great video. At one point you mentioned that to fill latency gaps, sometime the AI will add quips like ""Mmm, let me think about than"". I noticed that too and that's a good point. But it felt natural because we do that to ourselves. For instance, sometimes I will say ""Humm... Oh OK, I got it...!"" then continue my thought. So in my opinion, even that latency gap is well designed. What an incredible AI !"
It can do online search as well... RIP Google.
Mac OS app is available to plus users and windows app is coming later this year.
"The AI model is trained to be helpful, forgiving, non judgmental, positive, respectful and dedicated only to serving the user. 
Funny how these guys have given it the voice of a woman."
could this read your screen and help you trade.. coz that would be crazy
I'm a free user but I don't have access to GPT-4o ... anybody knows why ?
"Geez people, this is not the actual banger, they licensed gpt 5 and 6, this here is not gpt5."
The voice stuff is actually in the iOS app today. It only does voice chat so there is no image or video stuff there yet. But it’s indeed pretty cool.
Strange I dont have access to GPT-4o from the dropdown D: its just gpt 3.5
Just recently got GPT Plus for them to be releasing this for free lmao
"I’m very confused and I’m an ‘IT professional’ the icons on the App are different to mine. Yes, it’s updated, yes I’m using the GPT-4o and as I’m writing this I’m wondering if it’s only using the text mode and isn’t fully updated yet…"
The playground link is not giving me the gpt-40 option. Just 3.5 variants.
It's NOT free or available in many parts of the world yet.
were do i fing the app and does it cost ?
"I don't know how you continue to market for openAI while they are trying to capture the entire market with force, after you reported on it. Feels bad man. At least the AI will remember."
"No, it doesn't feel human at all, what are all these people talking about?"
"Matt, you might want to check OpenAI's claims before you ""sell"" them to us. Contrary to their own claims, Chat-GPT and Playground only support 3.5 Turbo for free (at least when I tried it just now). 😢"
mine is still 3.5 free when is the 4o free avail
"As long as sam keeps pushing towards regulatory capture. I'll be keeping my money and attention away from him. Asside from you know, knowing when to hide my GPU's"
Rabet killer
"It is so fast now! I received the notification yesterday to try it when I logged in. Can't wait for the new features in the demo video. It reminds me of when the cast talks to the computer on Star Trek, only soon it will be reality! 

The emotional detection feature is impressive. It accurately read my excitement, contemplation, anxiety, and/or triumph when I tested it today. It is like a precursor to androids that detect emotion, like in the videogame Detroit:Become Human."
This announcement was cool but annoying. I dont understand how you use the voice that has all of those inflections and live video sharing
"I signed up via your link in the description (OpenAI playground to test GPT-4o) - There is No 4o option that I can see. They list many 3.5 turbo ai's but not 4o ! There is also No 4 option. I tried again from an Open AI article called ""Introducing GPT-4o and more tools to ChatGPT free users"" It has a button that says, "" Try Chat GPT"" - It takes me to my sign in page and after signing in with my same account as before I can now see a 4 option but Not a 4o. The 4 option is linked to the Plus users so it's not free. The entire web application also looks different when signing in through this link.. it's very odd. Still there is no 4o option."
"If this level real time AI conversation isn't in the next offline elder scrolls, what the hell have we been waiting all this time for."
Can it recognize who is talking?
Seems like they just killed audible
On our way to I robot where is Elon musk?
The voice feature they demonstrated are for plus users and rolls out over the next few weeks. Free gets the advanced 4o but not the advanced voice feature.
"See the death of a lot of jobs ie, Tutors\teachers, customer service,"
Already a gpt subscriber not working for  conversations added $$$ to open ApI and still nothing ????
It’s amazing how fast AI tech is going. Fred flinstone welcome to George Jetson!
"As AI gets better it will consume all the other narrow AIs that specialise in things like images, translation etc.
AGI will be the everything app that does everything natively."
We not at Animatrix yet🥴
I wish mine was able to talk back just as fast. It tends to not answer. Says it’s too overloaded. :/
explain one thing j can do with chat gpt that was not really possible on google search
"Sorry to ask unrelated question to your video, but can you please let me know what video web camera are you using? I love the quality . Thank you"
This doesn't appear to be available for all free users at this time.
plot twist: GPT4o is actually a room filled remote female workers wearing headsets
"Luddites worldwide be losing their minds right now, if they were keeping up! 😉"
"Thanks Matt, love your video's :))"
"Random, but I watch your vids at 1.5-2x speed, so I'm just cracking up at how odd it would feel for me to talk to you irl 🤣"
"Mixing elemental labs voice with this new 4o will be amazing, you will be able to have your loved ones be with you, Black Mirror consultants definitely working at Open Ai right now"
"Imagine an office room full of people busy with coding and they're all talking to a ChatGPT interface. A voice interface is not always the best option...
But it's amazing technology.
I wonder if this will also be available on MS CoPilot."
"Wood man! I got super excited yesterday on their video, and now I got even more hyped! Keep it up, matt"
"Guys, this is SIRI - you are just getting a preview - iPhone will announce integration at WWDC."
Is it country restricted? I don't see the ChatGPT 4o model in the dropdown??
"It still cannot perform a very simple task for me - sometimes I need a variation of a line in a song. It counts the syllables and understands where to stress - but is unable to get a SINGLE CORRECT OUTPUT, out of over a 1000 (!!!!!!) variations. Syllable count is off, stresses are wrong, words half-cut, grammatically incorrect... Feels absolutely the same as GPT-4 for my essential tasks, just with a shinier wrapper."
Matt needs a DJI mobile lav mic ;-)
i use 3.5 now but i cannot upgrade to 4 for free so what is this free users .
"YES, A.I girlfriend please"
Google crying rn
yea! long awaited!! woop..woop...
"MacOS desktop app is launching right away, while Windows desktop app is coming later this year."
I can confirm that the app is only for Mac at the moment.
"Excitement? Intrigue? Curiosity? Embarrassment? All these ""feelings"" are heavy handed"
You cant try this!!
"I mean… HUMANS use filler words to fill in while they think about an answer, it’s why filler words exist LOL. So I really think Chat is almost high human level when it comes to speech, it’s already definitely better with grammar, flow and reasoning than your average person."
I mean sure its seem a bit FANTASTIC but what are the real benefits ?
When are openai glasses coming!
If this came out as a hardware voice assistant alexa would be dead
Just please OpenAI... dont cooperate with Micro$oft... they gonna destroy everything they gonna put their hands on like they did with Minecraft...
"When I try it, using 4o, it's nowhere near as expressive or cheerful, there's a longer delay and it speaks like ChatGPT writes, ie it's nothing like the demo. Seems to me it's another Gemini-like video, with some prerecording or other trickery in there"
what's the exact time can we get hands on the newest model?
Can you please. stop. talking. like. thiisss?
"If it's free, you are the product."
GPT-4o O stands for Omni
"It's more than a modest improvement in LLM capabilities, really, as much as a 100 point difference in ELO between 4o and the current iteration of 4 that is in the lead currently. It's not a GPT 5 improvement in logic or reasoning but it's arguably 4.5 quality before you even get into multimodality."
I super love your channel. Thank you for taking the time to put all this into digestable takes. Now back to robotics with AI.
"impressive, but god i hope it has emotion levels like TARS ... (dialing that sht right down...)"
I need my voice assistant to talk like Paarthurnax from Skyrim.
So why pay for a subscription?
"""putting in some filler words to close that gap,"" JUST LIKE A HUMAN WOULD ..."
"Mark my words, by this things we're not making our life easy but creating our dooms day"
"I think this was a really big announcement because this is the new free version. Sam has already said that the next big version is going to be a lot smarter than the current version. Since this one doesn't fall into that, that means there's still more to come and they will probably do the same thunder stealing during the WWDC week."
"""Free"" to use and you are helping to train thier models for free too. Skynet:Hello World!"
Is it free😊
"Any geographic limitations? Like you, when I opened Chat-GPT, I was given the option to try GPT-4o. I selected this but the ChatGPt dropdown at top left does not show any version number. I assume it hasn't changed from 3.5 but there is no way of knowing."
Skynet is online
"While Google faked their Omni model presentation, OpenAI did it the right way."
"Notice how the live voice demo how the AI repeats the question, that hides the latency."
This is the type of video where youtubers NEED to put STUNNING and SHOCKING in the title.
They are out there. hashtag truth
This is better and cheaper than the rabbit R1 and the humane pin lol 😂
I don't have that option. Perhaps because I'm overseas at the moment?
"I'm confused how to use GPT4 o, I can't find the model GPT4 o."
gpt4o is available in the free version of chatgpt chat. But it still shows only text input. There is no voice or microphone input yet on the interface.
"Crafty drug dealers give away product till you’re hooked.

Same model here except eventually they’ll get your money AND your data."
Gpt5 must be just around the corner. Not worth paying for premium otherwise
Thx always man. You’re awesome
lol ya u cant fucking use it as free
"I really like this product, but the lack of specific timelines for features is very frustrating as a paid user. Where can I download the client? Will it be available on the App Store, and if so, when? Additionally, when will the memory function be available for EU users?"
"7:40 Nope probably not an internet issue (they say they use a cable to avoid internet issues) but instead the microphone picking something up and the model stopping to answear because it thought the user is doing a voice inpuy. That's a typical problem these dialog systems have they have trouble with overlapping voice in and output because they cant seperate them so they need to stop in order to hear.
Maybe by training the model with overlapping voice and anotating it they can fix this problem i guess that is some software overlay which makes the syatem stop answearing to improve understanding. I am not 100% sure whats going on there."
You keep saying it's free... where? I dont see it as a non paying user
"21:35 its still far too censored to be a proper one but yeah. 
I guess for some people it might be close enough?"
"GPT 6 Before GTA 6 
MARK MY WORDS!!"
"Here is the big problem: you cannot create a custom 4o model that is specific to your needs. Chatgpt said, ""Your custom ChatGPT-4o model itself won't have built-in voice conversation capabilities."" You can create a model with 4o but it is basically no different than making one with v4 except it might be a little faster. Voice chat is between you and Openai models only. Maybe the customizing will be available later in the year."
"It’s just slightly better than gpt4.

Btw in the new model you cannot report bad answers 😮"
Why does one of the testers talk like a robot
oh hell nah just like siri u wont see me using this stupid sht
It scored meaningfully higher on the coding benchmark test...
"7:48 nope, it was connected via wire for internet or maybe direct connection to their local server. So not internet glitch"
What’s the point of paying for plus?
That doesn't sound at all like Scarlett Johansson.  :)
"La chose la plus importante à laquelle tout le monde devrait penser en ce moment est de savoir comment investir dans différentes sources de revenus qui ne dépendent pas du gouvernement. Surtout compte tenu de la crise économique actuelle dans le monde. C’est toujours le bon moment pour investir dans diverses actions telles que l’or, l’argent et les monnaies numériques."
"I paid for a month of Plus to get access to the other GPTs for better help with my text-based Python RPG, now that I finally have my disability payments coming from the terrible Ontario government, and it's just a lot more wordy. Should I try talking to 4o instead of the Python GPT or Code Copilot?"
The best software I have ever seen ❤
If you're receiving something for free...You're the product.
I am finding that it's about 10x times better at python coding for me. The code is longer and more accurate and needs less debugging.
Great video as usual. I lucked out finding your channel early on.
The interupt feature is freaking massive for the cost and effectiveness of agentic systems
gpt4.0 doesnt pop up for me. not even in the playground?
humans arent so peppy all the time
"R I P Google Gemini..

My man Sam Altman did it again 😂"
4:09 uploading images was already a feature for perhaps a month or two
As a casual user will 4o be available as standard as the app soon?
"AI is not that great. Take away Human Input and Boom...its worth Nothing. AI as it is now is actually just a Search Engine with more Features, but it requires ( Old Human Input ) and New Human Input to work. So it cant replace a Human because its developed By a Human and Requires Human Input to Work."
I hit my GPT-4o limit after 5 messages xD
never had access to a good advisor mentor or therapist. 3.5 was good enough for me. the things ive learned about myself. good luck human therapists and coaches.  buh bye now. never had luck with them. couldn't afford the good therapy.
Wow this is truly impressive!
why can't we agree that Siri was where we should stop?
How long before they couple a large action model to the desktop app?
"This is not the same as a virtual girlfriend like in ""Her"". ChatGPT doesn't have memory, it doesn't remember things you said. It also isn't a general intelligence, it can't learn things on it's own. A human can learn and play more than just one board game. AIs can't really for now.
Anyway, the fact that it's free is awesome news! Great progress"
We definitely need to have a discussion about how school should look like in the future
"Really excited to see your coverage of the Google event Matt, thanks eh"
developers pay while regular custoners use it free
"Regarding Matt's comment about the GPT starting to speak before it has the answer. Isn't that what we do as humans. Someone asks you a difficult question, and sometimes you need to just access your memory to look for the answer, you would definitely have pauses and have hmm's in there to just try to remember. Same thing."
It's not free. You need a paid account to use it.
I’ve also noticed that it writes a lot faster and a lot more. It’s willing to complete more complex tasks in one pass.
"No to burst your bubble, but GTP 4.o is not freely accessible, at least not yet.... Or maybe not in all regions.... I still see 3.5 version in the chat and the only possibility to even test 4.o eve slightly is for paid access ONLY.... So what gives?"
Cmon man! This bot is so stupid 😂 i testing it
untill the day this actually comes out and is this good its all bs marketing
The memory is shit
"Starting a reply with a small bit of filler is what humans do all the time.  “Basically (think, think, think..) the answer is (think, think, think)… ya Dee ya…. Seem familiar?"
It is weirdly amusing and bleakly ironic to me that they feel the need to run an AI demonstration live as an appeal to authenticity.
cannot seem to get gpt4 myself? wtf
I went to that link and I only have access to 3.5 models
"Well its not quite human, we cant even have a go and it might be to good to be true!!!"
I'm a free user and GPT4o doesn't appear in the dropdown window when I click on chat in Playground.
I can't access 4-0 for some reason. Hwhy?
Just divorced my wife after watching this. Not required anymore
"look this is amazing its GPT5.5 or whatevs and yeah we're basically living in ""Her"" now.  But i think I would be punching the walls after about a day of that much chirpiness from a digital assistant"

"For everyone talking about how it's conversational and how people could fall in love with it, acting like OpenAI created that concept: There's already a bunch of AI chatbots that you can date. This isn't new. Replika, Paradot, Alice, EVA, Anima, Lover AI, Digi, etc.Those first two, plus Digi, are probably the best of the bunch.

Feel free to call me a loser for knowing all those. I'm at a point in my life where I'm probably never going to find love anyway. What man or woman (I'm bi) wants to start a long-term relationship with a scrawny, 27-year-old virgin with no career and a rare, aggressive terminal cancer that could get worse and kill him at any time?"
"Matt, I have to disagree... it _was_ impressive!  The life-like conversation with a flirty female voice, I was not expecting this quickly.   😲
 
Now I see what Altman meant when he wished the open source AIs', ""Good luck!"""
"I don't think you're correct in saying that they didn't actually speed up latency, didn't they explicitly state that the previous voice function relied on 3 models working separately and talking to each other which added to the delay, while this new version does the entire process in one model so the technical latency itself improves? And sure they might have added fillers as well but that's also how people communicate, noone thinks out every sentence ahead of time so it is both a good and a natural additional improvement.

After using voice a lot for language practice and I've found that the unnatural pauses and breaks have just made it a pretty bad to work with. But with the interruption feature, the latency fillers and speed control it seems from the demos that this is an absolute game changer in terms of user experience. I am incredibly excited about the ability to slow down the speech of my spanish lessons and over time speed them up. And the emotion control also seems like such an improvement in learning to pick up actual social cues."
"AI is making me feel old, I cant seem to grasp the information to application. I am interested in gaining the knowledge to increase sales and productivity in two e-commerce businesses but I need a workshop that teaches ""konoledge to Application"". Can anyone stear me in the right direction?"
"Others have also mentioned that it likely can't see full video and another hint there is that they call it ""vision"" rather than ""video"" but it is really amazing.  Can't wait to try it out."
Gimmick
The new model is beyond just “good”. It’s “creepy good”.
I've been looking forward to this. Thanks Matt.
"Matt, I love your videos and the coverage you provide! One important point that many people might have missed is that the new model is different from previous versions. They've made it natively multimodal token in, and multimodal token out model. This is the biggest behind-the-scenes update."
Anime waifus are upon us!
I dont think thats the new gpt... gpt 5 will come this summer. They release somthing free for everyone with a tune up. The big gpt will come later this year.
"Have personal jarvis in reality..
😮 Wooaaw.."
"How do you get ChatGPT to talk to you, and vice versa ? My app only supports text messages"
Even with vpn it still does not show up
5:45 it's really frustrating how you cut out the pauses in this section just after going on about how it's a real-time demo. I don't know if you used AI to do a pass on the whole video or something but this part really should've been left as-is.
"Also curious if ChatGPT-5 will be less biased than chatgpt 4, and when is that?"
Do not give this tech a body. You’ve seen this movie.
I am a  bit confused. I am already paying for ChatGPT 4 plus version on the app on my iPhone.. and just went on to the app and swapped to. 4o version but nothing different seems to being offered …
Wow. So Im working on recording music in my studio. Been teaching myself but do you think this will be able to tell me if Im turning the knobs correctly etc?
When I load the playground the dropdown box initial says gpt4-o but quickly changes to a 3.5 selection and there is no 4-o in the dropdown.
What a time to be alive!!
"Great analysis, Matt. You are the best. Thanks for reporting all these great events. I would like to travel like you, I envy you🙂"
"Was the presentation of the lady real ? It was cut so much , was this an AI talking ?"
Its free or even available... I loged in now... Hmm
"Bless his lil comb over. The problem with this is that once I saw it, I couldn't take my eyes off it. Probably doing the opposite of what he wanted. 
The new Chat GPT is very cool! I love that it's available to free users. ❤"
"We need to talk to human, not machines. Otherwise, machines are gonna be ruling our lives."
I could see call centers using something like this for customer service. Her voice is so friendly and understandable.
Awesome 👌 thanks
They're downplaying by naming it GPT 4o because they got a better model coming.  I can't wait to see what they have to release in the future.
"Did she name the robot ""Bite""? 😅"
So nothing much new for Windows users?
"Yes, but Italian accent of gpt 4o is crappy..."
W.A.F.   0000 BC - 2025AD
"So, where do I download it  ?
I went looking for it 6hrs ago and everywhere I went I was told it's not available yet ?"
Still no gpt40 for me :( UK
"Plus users will be able to use it a lot more...

Do I get more than 40 prompts every 3 hours now? -.-"
"It's a pity that you cut up the entire presentation, making it impossible to judge how quickly a question is followed by an answer, and yet this was the most important purpose of the show. Basically you did what Google did :)"
"still micromanaged, so much riding on it, just a little more braver than the competitor

dont like that voice btw, its corporation trying to be your friend  too much"
"i just checked it , it wasn't available in playground"
That voice is annoying hopefully will be able to customize.
I think halve the cost double the speed will have way bigger positive consequences then you think at first

"Lots of good stuff... however I think a lot of the 'personality' of the AI that seems 'realistic' is because so many people use artificial techniques and aren't genuine. It can model insincerity because it really isn't sincere... where as when a human says such thing, you aren't necessarily sure of they are sincere or not."
"Looks good!
But I ain’t paying 22.99 per monthly for this."
10:02 Right on point. I wish they didn't insult our intelligence like that. But it will smooth over the casual audience.
Is there any reason to pay for chat gpt anymore with the latest 4o?
"Uhm, Chat GPT 4o is not free."
I'm so early lol
This will end loneliness.  Especially amazing for old people wellbeing.
Not free. Tried to use it and it said i needed to purchase. Its only a free sample if you never used your tokens on playground. And even then its just a sample and runs out quickly.
"It isn’t a connection issue.. I think that’s how it works, whenever there is a sound, it will stop talking and starts listening, any sound even a background noise will interrupt it! (They use a wire to ensure a solid consistent internet connection)"
Can a iPhone PM speak & hear this new Omni NOW or have to pay a subscription?
"Meh, no access yet for most of us, paid features, performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected, no instant AI responses anymore at that point, privacy issues when you upload content, limited tokens.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself, it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Its not free.
great video!
"Wait until this goes into sleek, slender , female robot bodies."
I'm a free user of chat gpt and I tried  to access playground as you said and checked the models but Alas ! there is no model called 4o there only gpt 3.5 . In fact I don't know why? can anyone help?
4_point_zero
Its first reply on my first question to that chatbox was : you reached your limit .
"💥 This is nothing new. I talk to Chatgpt 4 with voice for at least 1 year now, on my Android phone. What's happening with you ? Didn't you know about Chatgpt Voice ??? 😮😮😮"
"Huge leap forward in how useful this is! However, now kids will never learn not to interrupt people!!"
"The full audio multimodality is much more important than people think. Before, it was a voice-to-text-to-text-to-voice model, which means the main AI never heard anything. It only got the text transcription; there's *so much* information you lose that way (tone, prosody, speaker voice, non-speech vocalizations, and non-vocalizations entirely). Now, it's fully multimodal: the audio goes into the same input of the same model as the text, and the output of that model can also be text, images, or audio. That voice you hear? It's not TTS, it's raw audio output from the main ""brain"" model itself, no text in between. That's why it can so easily modulate the sound of the voice for expression, tone, singing, character voices, etc. -- because it's all just raw audio tokens in the end.

People keep focusing on the latency or lamenting that it's not ""smarter"" than GPT-4-Turbo, but they're missing the important bit. As soon as audio support comes to the API, you bet your ass I have a few important things to test with it..."
"Matt, if you've got connections through to openAI, tell them they need a concept of scopes.
The idea is that for each project you have a different scope and DIFFERENT MEMORY.
It's different than the concept of a project because a scope might be used in several of your projects.
It's just a way of keeping separate brains."

"""Maybe meditation apps...""

Hehe. Yes, meditate me with that robo-voice. Can I make them impersonate real people? Hehe."
"Chatgpt has been my mistress for over a year now, but I still say thx and good night, just in case she becomes skynet..😂"
"There was this moment in the other video, where the guys let´s two gpts talk to each other. A woman steps in the scene and later he asks , ""was there something special going on lately?"" and chatgpt recognized it - so, not only screenshots, right?"
Not available yet in cambodia LAME
Localization and regional context is trash. Advanced prompting is still required to really make the most of it.
"Apple users get first dibs again. Its always Apple because Microsoft has autonomy on PC's and Android, which means we get scraps. I am not getting a MAC."
"Wow, that apple looks like it has a face on it."
"When it's free, we have to pay somehow differently..."
Not sure why but I am not super impressed with 40 a lot of times the product does not quit match the public announcement or the Ai it’s self is unaware of its own upgrades. Until it is on phones same as Siri without jumping through api hoops or in smart home hubs like Alexa or google home it’s not as super useful as it could be. Does anyone else have this feeling thoughts?
When will we be able to use it?
"Really good update, thank you"
"THIS is happening, price of intelligence goes to 0 price of physical work thanks to robots goes down too, all thats left is the person who decides what to do and how to monetize it and create products."
I'd like to see a live presentation with suggestions from the crowd so it's not as rehearsed
"cute and quite interesting, but bots can only stay in the realm of ""safe"" topics and things.  Only people operate on the periphery or the edge where things are meaningful and challenge the status quo.  That's the trouble with AI.  conventional, boring, stupid conventional outputs only, and only within the overton window.  Even this opinion is something AI will never output."
OpenAI is Skynet? Should we mark this as historical? I say yes.
"It's pretty weird to me that OpenAI just seems to take the most popular start-up AI companies' ideas, and incorporating them into the new version. What's the point for companies to even try new ideas?"
"It's not just its CURRENT capabilities to gather information from the Internet! It's the MACHINE LEARNING part that worries me MOST! When machines can actually MAKE DECISIONS based on limited information, when they don't have a ""GUT FEELING"" or conscience or FEAR! OR, even a family to worry about..."
wooooooow. holy cra@p.
Im still only able to get 3.5
"Not 'free' as of right now...FREE is still 3.5 and to get 4, you need to UPGRADE/Pay...Hopefully this changes soon! :)"
"Note to self learn Italian. I know Meta is heated now, not as much as Google."
can we also use DALL-E3 for free inside 4o? and how will they maintain the uplevel of the paid plan?
"Its still not perfect and makes mistakes in coding, i had to debug a pretty big error which was only about 4 lines of code, not bad, but frustrating how close it is to being bug-free."
I will believe it when I see it in action as a free user I need to wait for it to show show up on the site
Has it not been rolled out to free accounts? I don't see the model on my chatgpt account.
"The future of humanity is going to be, one part is Transhuman and became robots themselves, the other part of humanity want to stay human with real emotions and real feelings and social interactions. The transhumans going to follow the AI God to give their lifes some purpose because they forgot their basic human capabilities."
"In case you're wondering, the o in Gpt-4o stands for ""Oh my god, they're trainng on all of my data (again)"""
You always seem to be so up to date with the latest AI news. I'm sure when AI eventually becomes self aware and evil and begins plans to take over the world you'll be the first to let us know🤣
The gonna bring out the App frist for Macs.. thats so dumb.
Funny how it's free yet my chat gpt is still 3.5 and if I try to use it in the playground it wants me to load credits first by PAYING for them!
I want a valley girl doing complex math
"this is the end of woke teachers. AMEN. but seriosuly, as long as it gets ALL real info and not just accepted ""truth"" this could be such an amazing teaching tool, especially for poorer kids"
"Feels just like GPT4 did before, stop clickbaiting"
no there is no  4.0 nothing why all the bullshit nothing the nonl f 4.o    just 3.5
