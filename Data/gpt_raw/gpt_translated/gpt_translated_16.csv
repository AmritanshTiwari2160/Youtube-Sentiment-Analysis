When we can use it?
It switched from European Spanish to Latin American Spanish based on the guy’s lack of a lisp. That was good.
"I love how you were struggling to rotate the camera the whole time 😂

It was kind of weird that the table was detected as a stylish person with a leather jacket."
Let's Gooo OpenAI 🚀🚀
"if you are seeing this from the future, just know that I will be the first person to edge to ASMR of chatgbt when it releases."
its not practical
Need that OpenAI coffee mug in my life
They make it look so innocent but it's actually very dangerous. AI is going to affect everyone and everything. Hope we survive the changes.
insane
Uh to get the right amount of intonation in Spanish is real crazy / people talk about job lost - but imaging having an universal translator at all times
Babylon fish
Still not as good as Star Trek translators
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
Me and my Vietnamese gf going on a date with gpt4o
I would love to see if this new model with the vision can translate ASL to English.
How many Nigerian kings we are having now with this one 👑
what a stupid fake translation... no AI can do all languages and even this example is like google translator: rubbish.
How chat pgt understand yall easily and I almost fight with it
"Language skill ✅

Language is not a handikap anymore. Have fun."
Incredible
"Let alone language tutoring, language learning for yourself to only interact and communicate is about to be obliterated. Not even to the age of brain chips which is also quite close, just some basic gear like earbuds and this AI will make the ability of speaking a foreign language irrelevant in less than 10 years."
So you're telling me my 10 years of painfully learning a second language have amounted to a hill of beans?
"thank y for realizing ""Her""🎉"
"As Interovert, I can imagine myself have more confidenfe to learn a new language in a more convenient and responsive way, can't wait, it looks so good. 🔥"
"Gemini feels like GPT 2 compared to this, and they're the most direct competitor"
Anyone else unable to access the headphone feature since the update?
That is loco…
"AI wants you to become dependent on it, just like calculator wants you to be dependent on it. Use the brain that God gave you, and learn new languages! Yes, AI can be a great learning tool, but we all know what happened to humanity's overuse of the calculator."
I was not mentally prepared for this.
"AI will either help us all or bring about our downfall. OpenAI, you're building the future. Make it great; you're on the right path."
"Well GG translators, I guess"
"I hope this can be available for everyone, not a pay to use"
"soon, all the human translators will be fired"
useless
🤫
"Thanks to AI, all ‘less value adding’ work activities and jobs will be wiped out."
This will be very useful to Roger from American dad
"Wow, now it is really happening..."
"Amazing but they need to simplify the entry point, like a single button that only knows MY language and can identify the other language on its own. Very awkward to ask someone if the speak Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese only to find they’re Japanese and have a migraine."
"this is beyond amazing, it's almost unbelievable that AI is progressing this quickly"
First comment
the job is over
Ladies Goo Makeup!
God damn
"Just glad they didn’t have Altman in any of these videos. Can’t stand that guy, he is and unbearable robot.  Multi billion $ company and these weirdos are all they got to show off their products"
Amazing
oh my...
"The guy on the right is from a good party, I think he wore the logo"
It's over for google translator
I think google translate app did that a few years ago.
the monthly subscription is annoying.why we can't buy the app at once !!
Good News for translators 😄
"How come english voice sounds so natural and spanish so crazy ridiculous 😂
Definitely some improvement still needed there"
RIP live translator jobs on the news or in political arenas.
It doesn't work on Google Pixel Android phones
So Morpheus here again 🎉🎉🎉
Now that’s the beginning of a new era.
I hope air leaves AI makers forever
"This is amazing, now learning a second language will be a choice, not an obligation, thanks"
De14b
Has anyone actually got access to this voice chat version yet? I have access to gpt4o but my voice chat version seems exactly as before.
I wonder when it will approximate the voice as well (ie translate a masculine voice with deep AI voice)...
Drake finna cook with this 😂
"Its a 'translator' when its written text, its an ""interpretor"" when its spoken language"
It will be useful when you have to prepare for an interview. Just upload the resume and ask Chatgpt to practice with questions.
"The tyranny of TRANSlators is finally over. This very well could save gaming in the west, or at least partially curb the influence from communists in the gaming industry."
isnt that feature was already in the older virsion?
The AI sounded the least robotic.
actually it isn't realtime :)
"Damn, the future is here."
"I am very sorry for this translation method. Altman! I would be very happy if you could see my comment. It would take twice as long as a normal conversation method if you spoke English and then spoke the same thing again in another language. It's too inefficient. It would be much more useful to combine words in real time before a sentence is completed and be translated into text. When an English speaker and a Spanish speaker have a conversation, the top part of the smartphone translates English into Spanish and the bottom part of the smartphone translates Spanish into English, and the conversation between the two will be able to have a conversation in different languages without much difference from the actual conversation time. Even if you recognize their voices and speak at the same time, it would be more fantastic if they were translated in different languages at the top and bottom. Of course, speaking at the same time would make an error. Please separate what you say at the same time and solve the translation at the same time later. Now, even with this technology, it would be possible to translate each language directly into text and display it in real time. It will still be possible to translate it into two different languages at the same time on the top and bottom of the smartphone. Please reflect this quickly!

If there's anything you don't understand, please leave it again!

And if you implement this method on a foldable smartphone that displays the front and back displays, you will be able to raise your smartphone when traveling to see and talk to the clerk about the translated language in real time. And it will be a revolution for people who use AR glasses. If AR glasses can also display sentences on the outer display in addition to the inner display, it will open an era where you can travel regardless of country by exchanging real-time translated text."
This is great. Upgrading now.
"There are still plenty of words and sayings that don't have direct translations. I wonder how this would handle those situations. Also, what if someone is speaking sarcastically? Will it convey that to the other person?"
nother one bites the dust !
"5 years from now:

She's soo hot.

WTF bro, she's ai."
I'll stop my English course then
"Suddenly my mobile interface looks like desktop version of ChatGPT, which is to say, not at all interactive. Instead of the orb, there's a text entry field. But it worked before. Now it doesn't. I wonder waht gives."
Star Trek... has become reality. WTF.
Help me translate from LGBT to English
Dam ik alot of companies are shaking right now. OpenAI is really changing the game
WOW
"Spanish/English is a bit of a joke. It already translates very well. Come back with Mandarin, Korean or Japanese and or one of those click languages and we'll be impressed"
I'm so glad I decided to switch career paths from translation to finance. This will put a lot of people out of jobs
That leave us with the hard question is there any point ik learning languages?
How many human translator loss their jobs
Huston…we finally found jarvis. I repeat we found jarvis
What's next week ! @open AI what the Evento ?
This would be so much better if they both were wearing AirPods.
連通上帝的巴別塔被OpenAI重建了！？💯
there goes the translators job!
😂😂😂😂😂😂RIP GOOGLE
the world has changed
damn thats pretty impressive/cool no ones gonna have to learn a language lol! that being said the spanish one does sound slightly robotic compared to the english one
RIP translator jobs. RIP language learning apps.
we finally can understand what Chileans are saying
ChatGPT's voice still has Sam Altman's vocal fry
LETS GOOOO
Well thank got I've got my 2nd education. I think I could be a teacher for about 2 more years... definitely need to get 3rd education ASAP
When he said berberberber I understood that.😅
I feel like I'm riding the monorail.
"Nahhhh, this is insane."
Google is going to have to do something. Fucking spectacular to keep up. I think Siri is just going to become relevant again
ChatGPT can understand all known different varieties of Spanish without having to indicate it as you would in Google Translate.
Why cant i use this feature in aus?
"This is not proof, this can be done with editing and you've already manipulated videos in this way claiming that was in real time then too."
"Soon they will have translation automatic where you can talk to someone on the phone and it will instantly translate to you and vice versa. We'll have the real-life Star Trek voice interpreter. In fact, it's already here."
wow!
Can’t see it in the App Store
google translator: 💀
can someone explain how exactly you download this for your phone and use it like they are here.
So excited!
"Hi Openai, remember me...we used to be friends."
I couldn't start video call. still only voice even tough I selected chatgpt 4o
You guys are changing the path of humanity in real time 😅
Hopefully we get an anger translator like Luther... would come in handy.
Why does speak Spanish like Michael Scott?
"If I am studying a degree of translation in university, whether need to drop it tomorrow?"
"There’s already a device that does this with Japanese real time if I’m having a three-way conversation in Spanish Japanese and English, how accurately can you translate to both for example Japanese to Spanish and English I would like to see more complex conversations"
The voice in spanish is weird still
This is really useful...👍👍👍
"Please, train the AI in Bangla language. It's not good enough to catch fluent local Bangla. It can barely form Bangla sentences."
When will it be available?
As a foreign language teacher I fūćkéd up. 😮
"This will definitely be useful, while lost in a different country and needing directions"
"This is amazing, but only if there isn't any background noise. Great for one on one meetings in a quiet room, but this will not work well outside of that."
How many language translators will loose job
nah this crazy..the future is about to go crazy
"A consultation with 20 dollars a month using ChatGPTPlus real-time translation, could translate several Youtube videos about Programacon per month?"
It has a thick accent in spanish but impressive nonetheless
"Meanwhile, Google continues to sleep with YouTube, which at this point should already have a function to translate the words in videos into the listener's native language."
My god. Slow down AI progress...its getting smarter and smarter at such a rapid rate and can soon pose a serious existential threat to humanity. I am not happy seeing a video like this.
"Hi OpenAI, first off, thank you. Thank you for continuously providing not only Opened Sourced ChatGPT for more technically inclined individuals to continue in the research and development and enabling such an upgraded GPT-4o for users to fully grasp AI’s rapid expansion and evolution in the industry. With that said, thanks again for the extended free prompts for testing such features. As mentioned within a WIRED article recently published, “Just know that you’re rate-limited to fewer prompts per hour than paid users, so be thoughtful about the questions you pose to the chatbot or you’ll quickly burn through your allotment of prompts.” Kudos. I can’t wait to be able to pick and choose between consented personality voices of individuals partnering with OpenAI for a more personalized “voice” of preference when interacting with GPT and enabling its latests search and translation features."
0:56 - Siri 2.0
"Yes, finally! This is actually something useful. Thank you.
I saw a demo from Google doing live translations years ago, but I have no idea what happened to it. 
Also, we need to translate text and audio files as well so that anybody could access any knowledge they want regardless of language barriers."
"this may seem like a really uncomfortable interaction for normal humans, but this is an accurate depiction of tech bros interacting."
"Finally, alien technologies have found application in the lives of ordinary people!"
"Duo is sooo cooked, another netflix might happen, but to them 😂"
"The rippling in the water, would seem to indicate that a feeding frenzy of some sort is underway and things might start to get, what was that heathen's 'theory' called again. I remember the theory was eponymously titled. Ahhhh, now I get it. ""It"" being exactly just what, I'm not so sure about."""
Amazing!
This is crazyyy... Wtf is happening???
❤
"Very useful for traveling to countries you don't know the language, but I think real time translators and interpreters are still needed because conversations depends a lot of the context, and sometimes you don't need to translate literally all the information to the other person to understand the message. 

Anyway, nice tool"
"I hope they can get rid of this robotic voice crack side-tone with the next update, otherwise all this stuff is super impressive"
No wonder Apple closed the deal with OpenAI yesterday. Sam must’ve showed them a demo and Apple new they couldn’t compete lmao
Wow! What a great time to be alive! This will be useful on my travels.
my key takeaway is that it can easily recognize fast paced type languages like spanish. dang.
You guys already showed that in the live stream..
“I’ve been preparing for an event next week. The world will see soon” anyone else think this is confirmation of GPT5 announcement 👀
It looks like Hal 9000
How do I get this?
how to get 4.O?
Duo is sweating rn
Yet another job vanished into the ether.
How many startups were just bankrupted?
"Wait for this to be incorporated into game lobbies and chatrooms (discord, zoom, skype etc.)"
Whet it exit for Italy and Europe?
"Neat. But, I want to see *actual* real time, like as you speak, it translates. Can it do that?"
"Awesome, I just used it with a plumber at my home to translate between Finnish and English. Thank you so much, great timing in releasing this."
Vastly better than anything I've seen.
Sam Altman ending careers left and right 😂
UFC Post Fight interviews going to go A LOT FASTER 😂
