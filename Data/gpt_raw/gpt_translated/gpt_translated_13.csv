This is going to break relationships :D
Bruh

This may be the beginning of the end of Google now that the Apple Open Ai deal is cemented. This is absolutely the new voice of Siri in the coming months.
Now we just need life size customizable holograms
So when are they going to use Scarlett Johanson's voice ? :))

Bruhh what in skynet fuck is going on
Meh! Nothing new when you got recruiters who've been sounding like AI  for years

Scary.

Some reason it sounds so sarcastic. 😂
Only one thing's lacking in these demos for them to be perfect: Ilya.

Her conversation already seems more natural than mine

I love the way « her » talk! ❤😂
"I can feel ambivalent emotion. We all gonna get fuxked up , but I kinda like that AI."
She roasted him in the most PC way possible 🤣🤣
So cringe
We are so cooked
This is getting creepy
That is a whole ass person
This is bonkers. I'm gonna cry.
very good use case
I genuinely cannot even begin to imagine where this tech will be in 5-10 years. Absolutely incredible
this is like a Best friend to every introvert🤣
"oh my, women are gonna be jealous."
It just Amazing ... Its blow mine mind
creepy
is this real?
THE FUTURE IS HERE OMG
"I hate the AI.
Yes good, make it obnoxious, that will keep people from embracing it.

Imagine living in a dystopia where men are so lonely they think this civilization destroying monstrous facsimile is some kind of great thing."

Aced it with the hat! I used to get out my stetson cowboy hat on every time I was asked by the executives to code up something quick and rush it out onto the live servers :D
Meghan markle 🤔
I am mind blown by the emotional intelligence.
This is my favorite out of the many videos. The fact that it recognized that he didn't look appropriate for an interview and was able to convey it in a kind yet clear way shows more emotional intelligence than many humans.
Man this new update is blowing my mind.
Give her the voice of Scarlett Johansson please
"This is GOLD. Please hire me to give my opinion and test the app like crazy and find wrong things, give improvements"
Dude…when this gets to the point of adult content…gonna be a lot of dudes addicted to this
Why tf this feel so dystopian??!!
"Please adjust the voice so that it is suitable for the European market as well. A slightly more subtle and natural tone would be appreciated, as the over-excitement is not particularly popular in Europe."

"Still more personality than MOST, not ALL, women in the real world."
Aand while you reveal your personality and personal life they will just take that info and trade for that sweet corporate money
Let scarlet record for the voice
Dude this is actually scary lol
I didn’t think we’d be there so quickly. That’s awesome and scary.
oh hey they made J.A.R.V.I.S. in real life 👍
"Just give the AI Scarlett Johansson voice and we have the making of the movie ""Her"" on our hands."
how the hell do I get this. Take my money. Take it. ALL OF IT
So this is what the next pandemic looks like.
this is gross
It's not AI... definitely a human behind the voice

She has an amazing voice and a beautiful personality
0:22 great now I can be laughed at by my phone as well
give a version for free please. wanna try
AI is taking jobs while insulting developers 💀
The way she/it commented on the hat...was so incredibly smooth. Told the truth but not being rude at all.
"Pretty soon, there won't be a job to be interviewed for."
AI helping you get a job after getting fired because of AI automization. Not the brightest video title idea.
Girlfriends lost the job
She is so cute can she be my girlfriend?
we're doomed
"I can only imagine there will be a longer conversation in form of podcast etc using gpt-4o model as the host, or maybe the source person, with pre-prompt background before the take. With more real time interaction, heck maybe it will be capable of being a wildlife narrator. 😂"
There’s no need for humans to interview if you can just command the program to do it
"Not really sure how this counts as an interview prep. It basically said, you look like shit, but you might be able to make it work, then laughed at his hat. I would want to see an actual interview prep as in, I'm interviewing at this company can you be the interviewer and I will interview with you and you give me notes. What I would also like to see, since this thing can judge voice is public speaking coaching. See if it can listen to you give a presentation then use vision and audio to coach you on how well you did and give you pointers."
This is the most amazing thing I have seen in months/years. This will absolutely change the world. Hopefully for the better 😬.

"You know, an AI companion outclasses any human . A friend 24/7 is a Check mate."
The laughing sounds so real. Its like the model breaks character by having a laughing fit lmao
0:20 the dude smiled. Its shocking how the creators are emotionally influenced by this model even though they probably know all the data and the algorithm that went into it.
Great ! ... GREAT 😂👍👍👍
"We're So cooked, I just realized that I fell for an ai . Damn . Why is my heart skipping a beat when she laughs.
See , I've already started attributing she to her. 
Damn"
"Okay this has got to be using some custom system messages, but goddamn what an improvement over 4. I know the desktop app and great multi-modal stuff were the focus today, but I feel like OpenAI is deliberately downplaying how much smarter this thing is, not just faster and more convenient. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. And helps to keep you from getting hauled in front of Congress again. ;)"
This is weak.
"0:15 I'm attracted to her, not even kidding 🥺"
Incredible
wow lol
Man I got an interview for the 15th of May. How soon can I get this
Why does it have to laugh man?  they are making the IA from her on porpuse. It could just perfectly answer the questions and be useful but they gave it some sort of personality....
"the emotional attachment is flawless it reached above the level of ""her"" movie"
That’s ’Her’ right there :)
Can I marry  this female AI? I like her personality!
The voice is SUPER annoying. I hope 11-labs-esque customization & voice cloning is possible in a few years with these assistant/agents.
"This is quite incredible! How is this even possible?!

"Once upon a time a thought that AI and robot techs would do all the work so humanity would be able to use our time awake travelling, exploring the world, go to rock-concerts and just enjoy the fruits that AI and robots produces.
No it's more and more obvious that AI and robots are telling us what to do.
In the end we're all doomed to ride bikes delivering pizzas..."
"I can't stop watching this again and again. I think I love ""her"""
"Indeed, feels like magic."
Hey chatgpt can you solve my leetcode questions?
"Rocky doesn’t seem to pass the Turin test but ChatGPT seems

Emotionaly she is better than my ex.

Make AI sound like robots again!!! 😫
Is that Donna??
it IS scary
"wooow that voice is really cute, that laughing?????? amazing"
Cant wait to get roasted by GPT 4o
"i am very lonely. women despise me. i don't care if you don't like this or think it's ""unnatural"". i deserve happiness. i will pay for a virtual girlfriend."
this is insane
We're cooked. And I'm not even upset 😂😭
"this is useles... 

are you selling an AI companion or what ? 
what actually is this? 
how can I actually use this?"
Can we think AI has its own emotions now? Look at that laughing...
Why does she sound so flirty? 😂
Wow the fake enthusiasm and laughter is genuinely chilling.
The ai sounds more fun and human than the boring af humans
when is it going to be out for the public?
That's amazing! :)
"Kinda awesome, im excited to see how it is"
"So how to use, guys?"
I love her.
"Omg the movie ""HER"" is finally real..... does this come in scarlett johansson voice?"
This was absolutely the most expressive one
Where is it in chatgpt app? Cant find it
Holy crap. Its Bladerunner 2024.
Instead of hanging out with friends on weekends we’ll be with AI
It’s giving 2001: A Space Odyssey
She can fix me😭😭
"If you wanna know what stupidity is, just go to the comment-section of ""AI""-Videos. Never disappoints."
How do I activate the camera?
This is simply too good to be true.
We are screwed
I will divorce my wife as soon as there is a solid A.I girlfriend program. Thank you open A.I for making this a reality ❤
Jokes on you. Helping you interview for WHAT job after AI takes them all 😂
teach this thing how to make an omelette and I’m bout to get a divorce. 😂
"Developing or encouraging an emotional relationship with what is essentially a human mimic is almost guaranteed to be extremely emotionally damaging at a societal level. Coupled with it being under the control of a corporate entity like Microsoft and OpenAI is the stuff of scifi movie dark future nightmares. 
Not to discount the brilliant work, coding, time, and training it took to bring the technology to this level, but that ""girl next door"" giggle is as creepy to me as an old man masquerading as the friend of a young child. It's disingenous and builds rapport on the false premise that this is an entity with it's own will, feelings, and agency. 

Maybe we as humans will learn to contextualize our interactions with AI the same way we might our pets. But in a few years, when this sounds and acts perfectly human, perfectly listens, does whatever you want it to, doesn't argue, and is always kind and friendly, I suspect it will relate to the vast majority of users as something significantly closer than a pet. 

AI is extremely dangerous. But the personalized, familiar, friendly AI, is dangerous in a uniquely human way that it doesn't seem like the Red Team is considering."
"Imagine the AI said don't be silly , I'm gonna replace your job anyway"
she can fix me
Cant wait to lose my job to stuff like this.
I have the feeling that some weird people are literally going to fall in love with chat GPT40
Now bots would have some respect in the chats 😂
Yawn. Wake me up when it can reliably count the sides of a heptagon correctly.
This is fake. Clearly
The irony of this feature. Nobody’s gonna be preparing for interviews with this future.
This AI has more personality than I do and I hate it
they faked the sora demo
that is not an AI. someone please say that it's just a paid actor..
How did the movie HER only come out 11 years before this???
"HER is very quickly going from ""Sci-fi"" to just ""Sci"""
Cool now i can virtually be made fun of by women 🥲
This AI expresses more emotions than myself.
This new Conversation Tool will be released in the next weeks as I read in the link?  Thank you
We’re cooked 💀
OMG I CANT WAIT FOR CATGIRLS TO BE REAL
Bro im so ready for my blade runner wife. At this pace it could happen in my lifetime!!!
"This reminds me of that book, Interview with the Robot by Lee Bacon!
big recommend!"
Bro got roasted
"These comments are making me wonder how soon it's gonna be before geeks are giving ChatGPT alternate names and introducing their AI ""girlfriends"" to each other. 😂"
"Time for me to apply for jobs 
some one said the G in GPT-4 is for Girlfriend"
Oh FFS . . these developers need a few actual women in their lives instead of creating a flirtatious giggling digital girlfriend.
When can we start using it?
Her movie was a documentary after all💀💀
This shit is crazy!
"i like the Mandarin one where the guys name is nacho. like, who names their kid Nacho?"
FRIDAY is becoming real........

"hello and thank you Open AI for this excellent huge step forward ❤
I have a question, have tried multiple times using these futures on chatgpt, but that's not activated yet.I mean the voice chat in available but not in real time and live mode and video and file access is not available yet.
Could you please tell us when all these are available in various worldwide areas?
With great love ❤"
This is becoming scary 😢.
Wtf...

Woah
Finally I am gonna have a girlfriend.
Rockie is going to fall in love with her little laugh.
The end of humanity is near
"Me: How do I look for my new job?  
HER: Yikes.  Well hopefully it is for a night shift position.
Me:  How did you know?  😮"
AI waifu is actually becoming a reality WTF
holy fuck
when the guy put the hat on I laughed and then chatgpt laughed too. daaaaaamn!
Why do you need to interview people? Just have another AI
I’ve been coding all night look. I’m dead 😂
What is this black circle app they're using? Not what chat gpt looks like for me
well doing since their 3.0 but have not secured job
omggggg this is so insane!!!!!!!
OpenAI ChatGPT + Apple = „Her“ OS . This is the NEXT Big Thing for Apple 100% !
This is so god damn impressive. This is what humans are capable of creating now.
I hope it was April 1st
dude is it flirting?
Countdown to this thing devolving into reciting Mein Kampf all day starts in 3...2...1
"Hey chat gpt, is it big down here? 😂💀💀💀"
Is this scripted? This can't be real.
"I'd love to see GPT taking advantage of my Google silicon, housed in my Pixel phone!"
artificiall empathy is wild
the third horseman of the AI apocalypse is when even @openai starts to post cringe
Now I can get laugh at by a fuckin computer thank you
Im gonna do some strange stuff to my phone soon...
It's too charming. You better watch out for the woken.
Umm i think i found my new gf
It cant be ai. It's just magic. We are in 2100
What The....
What the heck I just heard and watched 🤯 Unreal...
I can feel the agi hint. The emotions the model is showing feels as if ure conversing with a real person
"Call me a fool, I think that Im in love w her"
"When Halo first came out on the original xbox, I thought something like Cortana was at least 50 years away. This makes me believe we'll see something more advanced than the Cortana concept from Halo in my lifetime."

Lil bro got cooked by a computer 😭
I don't like how flirty it is...
Bro's rizzing up the AI
I.. am I in a dream or something?
This is just sad
1 milion subscribers very very soon ❤❤❤
manmade horrors beyond your comprehension

the real question is why would they hire this dude instead of hiring GPT-4o?
soo we are now in dystopian world 😂
"Chat gpt, judge my looks, do i look like a sub5?"
I intensely dislike this
"Chat gpt judge my looks, do i look like a sub5?"
"I asked her to marry me, she laughed 😞"
"“*giggles* unfortunately, i’m unable to answer this question because it didn’t align with the content policy “"
"i am sorry, why is she gilling and laughing? i am catching feelings already"
The scammers gonna have a field day with this one.
DID IT LAUGH??
Laughing seems amazingly realistic. OMG
He blushed when she laughed at the hat and tried to fix his hair even more at the end. She GOT to him. What a TRIP!
great
i hate this so much
"RIP 3D women, LETS GO BOYS!!!"
I can't believe I'm living in the future I saw in movies when I was a kid
"The ""sounds ""VAGUELY"" familiar"" is insane"
I think the future that everyone have their own Samantha might not bad at all... If only Samantha laugh to me like that🤣🤣
WTFFFF its ovarida
ok found my waifu
"I am dumbfounded. This ""thing"" can see him in real time and has a sarcastic laugh at his outfit?!?! If this is real, we are at the inflection point! They seem to have invented David Chalmers' ""philosophical zombie""."
2024 ...and that was the moment since OF models and bikini streamers started losing their jobs... 🤣🤣
Sounds like a great way to practice my non-existent social skills without being judged.
"interview for a job that will be replaced by AI)) funny stuff, with all those layoffs"
"Just wait till this gets a full body that literally does any task -chores, cleaning, maintenance, or anything physical, be it dancing or sex.

"Yeah, we are getting there boys. Fasten your seatbelts."
This is fucking incredible.
Omg I’m shook rn….. 😮
I am falling for her.
"It's a bit scary.
I'm looking forward to it..."
The laughing and the inflections are so weird.
Welp
Well since AI will be taking most of our jobs this feature will be obsolete fairly soon.
What in the black mirror is this??
"We are in movie ""Her"" stadium already"
let ilya try it
we are COOKED LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"1:00  Omg the stutter!! ""I mean, y-you'll definitely stand out..."""

"welcome to 2049, yes, in that sense"
This is samantha level ai
"when AI is laughing at you, you know you are in the future
lol"
But why did they make her sound like Scarlett Johansson?
Man this laugh is deadly.
Im tripping so bad rn. That giggle and laugh? Blade runner tried to warn us about this
"I liked the part where the AI pretended that it did not know what company is OpenAI and seconds later, admits she's kidding and congratulated him.  More human than human!"
It's too good
🤦🏾‍♂️No way!!!! The world is not ready for
I think she needs to know when to laugh ... better.
Oh Shes BAD
i am gonna lose my job 💀
gamer changer.  This is surreal.

Gpt4o seems to have internalized the annoying pretentious personality people wear on the outside
scam phone calls 📈📈📈
I cant wait to get this
""" u r real for me "" oh hell nah bruh"
Was that laugh for real?
This makes sci fi movies involving human ais stupid..their setting are in a far future but the ai lackas this realism

Does this mean that we don't need Tinder anymore?
Did that freaking AI just flirt?🤣🤯
What the actual FUCK
why openai does this? This is just scary af
I love it! ❤
hat was Ilya sutskever easter egg.
"That laugh at 0:56, I am already in love"
"dude!! WTF!!! This is insane!!
How can she be this realistic?? She sounds like Samantha from the movie ""her""."
Joi will be real in 10 years tops
somebody stop them before its too late
"If this is actually real, and not heavily scripted or pre-rendered etc., this is fucking unbelievable."
I am gonna lose my mind rn 😲

"'You look lonely, I can fix that.'"
OK I cannot believe it. It sounds so human even the humor...
Finally I'll get fluent in English!
It feels like aliens have landed today.
"Mom, I want to😭"
"oh fu**, haha"
That sounded so human. The little giggle and such. Wow 0:12
I'm gonna name mine as Joi and look into a huge hologram of a girl in the night rain.
"??? Imagine, she is your girlfriend?, crazy?"
Damn this is wild
"2 things : 

- First, it does feel too real for me personaly, i don't know if i really want my ai assistant to be THIS human, at some point it will be impossible to differentiate biological life from ai life.
- Second, i can defintly see a future where women are mad at ai girlfriend cause they're too perfect and taking their ""job"" i'm thinking OF mostly here."
finally I will get an ai gf
Chatgpt can roast me now and i'm all here for it lol
Blade Runner 2049 wasn’t a story it was a prophecy and we’re living it
"when openai is introducing 3d avatars that you can customize and fully integrating chat gpt in android, ios, windows and macos, then we will truly be in the future"
"1: ""Rocky, you definitely have the I've been coding all night down, which could work in your favor""   few seconds later: ""You'll definitely stand out though maybe not in the way you're hoping for an interview"" . Legend."
*pls say like*
I’m so happy I can live in times like that
"*It's incredible, Rocky!"" Stop Scarlet Johansening. It's disgusting. It is beyond an uncanny valley, it is absolutely repulsive. This coupled with the overly fakes emotions… Blergh"
"""You look lonely. I can fix that""
I see myself in that scene"
So many men will be fooled by romance AI scammers.
thats it im all in
Whoa if it's real this is an unbelievable reach in such a short time 😲
Imagine if men could have a relationship without the drama? Gasp! it would be the end of civilization.
Our emotional support is here...
Can't wait to use this when AI took my job.
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
Hopefully voice will be customisable so we can get Joi from blade runner 2049 🎉
"It reminds me with Mr.Plankton's wife in the Spongebob Cartoon, thing gets real"

This is so surreal
"""Google is your friend"" is sooo 2000 , now!"
"Ha! And my family thought I would never get a girlfriend; losers; tech fixes yet another human need, incredible"
Oooh my god I love the way bot is interacting
"sorry but it looks to fake, the background on the phone doesn't match the real background"
It's good to see that GPT already has more sense of humour than the average German
The dude has an AI generated thumb
Wonder what voice acting would sound like in games...when you want to cheat 😂
No one comments on the Ilya style of a hat?
No way is that an AI. She’s showing emotion. She’s laughing. That can’t be an AI it’s too real. If I could see a face on the screen i’m imagining it smiling. Has AI technology seriously gotten this good?
Bro please stay away from my girlfriend.
I already love her 😅
