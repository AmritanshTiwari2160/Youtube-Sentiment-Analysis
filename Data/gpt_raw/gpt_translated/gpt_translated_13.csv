There‚Äôs no need for humans to interview if you can just command the program to do it
"Not really sure how this counts as an interview prep. It basically said, you look like shit, but you might be able to make it work, then laughed at his hat. I would want to see an actual interview prep as in, I'm interviewing at this company can you be the interviewer and I will interview with you and you give me notes. What I would also like to see, since this thing can judge voice is public speaking coaching. See if it can listen to you give a presentation then use vision and audio to coach you on how well you did and give you pointers."

I know the desktop app and great multi-modal stuff were the focus today, but I feel like OpenAI is deliberately downplaying how much smarter this thing is, not just faster and more convenient. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. And helps to keep you from getting hauled in front of Congress again. ;)"
This is weak.

wow lol
Man I got an interview for the 15th of May. How soon can I get this
Why does it have to laugh man?  they are making the IA from her on porpuse. It could just perfectly answer the questions and be useful but they gave it some sort of personality....
"the emotional attachment is flawless it reached above the level of ""her"" movie"
That‚Äôs ‚ÄôHer‚Äô right there :)

"Developing or encouraging an emotional relationship with what is essentially a human mimic is almost guaranteed to be extremely emotionally damaging at a societal level. Coupled with it being under the control of a corporate entity like Microsoft and OpenAI is the stuff of scifi movie dark future nightmares. 
Not to discount the brilliant work, coding, time, and training it took to bring the technology to this level, but that ""girl next door"" giggle is as creepy to me as an old man masquerading as the friend of a young child. It's disingenous and builds rapport on the false premise that this is an entity with it's own will, feelings, and agency. 

Maybe we as humans will learn to contextualize our interactions with AI the same way we might our pets. But in a few years, when this sounds and acts perfectly human, perfectly listens, does whatever you want it to, doesn't argue, and is always kind and friendly, I suspect it will relate to the vast majority of users as something significantly closer than a pet. 

AI is extremely dangerous. But the personalized, familiar, friendly AI, is dangerous in a uniquely human way that it doesn't seem like the Red Team is considering."
"Imagine the AI said don't be silly , I'm gonna replace your job anyway"
she can fix me
