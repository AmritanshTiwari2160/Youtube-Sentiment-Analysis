"OpenAI is applying the Lord of the Rings Phrase but modified to ""One Software to Rule Them All""
Presents and futures.
It is obvious."
"When it's free, we already know who the product is. Surely they have already run out of training data and want to collect audio in planetary quantities. The ""good"" version will be the next version of omni."
I have tried the option of telling her to be my English teacher and help me correct my grammar and pronunciation. IT'S CRAZY.
"The birth of the future 🤩🤯, will I come back to this comment and say ""-that was nothing""???"
"Excellent presentation and video. I have a doubt at minute 45:50 of the video, it may be that the cell phone is in airplane mode. ? If so, what internet connection does it use or is it something closed? Thank you .."
We will have to wait a little for the waifu in Spanish... But we already have our gringa waifu 🥰
gracias
"When can you access this new version, the link please"
"The problem of an AI that sees everything that is on your screen and sees and hears, I see it in data privacy, millions of office workers will have it working to help them with data from their company or from their clients or patients without knowing where that data is going and what can be done with it."
I hope that in Mexico in the next elections we can have an AI president instead of the clowns who I know are currently running for president.
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Lie the free version you can't use any of that
Thanks Carlos.
Do you know when it will be available in Spain?
luckily raymon kurzweil prophesied that in 2030 there will be universal basic income with which one can live very well

Made with HARPA AI"
Really really hyped
In Spanish it looks like Aznar speaking in Texan 😂😂😂😂😂
"Use the white IDE, is that high junior (?"
"Now it's going to make you want to install gpt chat, for now I was with copilot"
"The good trick of publishing the free GPT Chat first also served all those who do not speak English because you read the text with your perfect native accent from wherever you are. Although they now publish it for free, I think that in some countries with those voices no one wants to have a guy talking when the most basic and least useful AI voice of Siri or Alexa had more natural voices. I love it in English and I am lucky to be able to use it in English but I will use it less because in my environment it will not have that same boom.
I want to think (I highly doubt it) that if you can tell him to speak in a robotic voice, maybe you can also ask him to adjust his accent a little? Or select the main language in the app and then automatically adjust the accent?"
Let them lower the price of the monthly subscription :(
"Paid gpt chat is rubbish, I already bought it and it never works well, it's no use that it can do incredible things if it always crashes"
"Just today I saw that I could use the gpt4o version but it took me two hairstyles.
Maybe they haven't loaded everything yet but what worries me the most is that they offer it as if it is going to be free for everyone and after using it for a while, not much... I have been changed to the gpt3.5 model and it tells me to pass per box for the plus version.
I hope this changes this week and that it works better than what little they have shown me, because it was cool, but far from what they have shown.
And the vision option hasn't let me use it to show what my camera sees."
"Now that I think about it, it is true to be testing the latest, most advanced model. As many free as plus users. And that this gpt-5 to the. Around the corner. They did the same thing last year that they released a month before gpt-4 came out, both free and plus users used gpt-3.5 and then gpt-4 came out"
"Hello, where can I get it in Spanish. thanks, at least with subtitles"
"This is historic, we will know how to cooperate to use future technologies."
What I'm going to do is take a plumbing course or take care of goats. This is amazing.
It doesn't work with that friendly tone. I've already tried it and it's quite dry. I have used Sky. And also sometimes she has delusions in which she doesn't know that she is talking. I also cannot activate the video to interact directly through the camera or to recognize the environment.
"Export the Azure, Power Apps, Copilot, Chat GPT, Revit, Plant 3D, Civil 3D, Inventor, Building or Refinery ENGI file to Excel, prepare Budget 1 and export it to COBRA. Prepare Budget 2 and export it to Microsoft Project. Solve the problems of Overallocated Resources, Planning Problems, prepare Budget 3 with which the construction of the Building or the Refinery will be quoted."
I want to be able to change the voice and put Cortana's voice in Latin 😍
Can Chatgpt be linked to Alexa's Echo dot? so that alexa responds to you like open ia
"The question that arises for me is, can I recognize and differentiate different voices simultaneously? how many?

Suppose the following case, two people, one person speaks English and the other Spanish, decide to speak through chatgpt, instead of both speaking the same language,

Will chatpgt be able to recognize the voice of the person speaking in English to translate it into Spanish and then recognize the voice of the person speaking in Spanish and translate it into English in the same conversation without having to use two devices (one for each person)?"
"Thanks Carlos, thanks Openai, great gpt4o better and for everyone and cheaper for when we can ;)"
"Well, I think that Apple has been friendly told to give them a lot of pasta or eat them with potatoes... that Microsoft is hungry. And if they say no, bye bye apple"
39:41 ASMR moment with the computer
How screwed Google is
"Damn Carlos, I'm almost more excited to see you happy about the changes than the changes themselves xDDD"
"Apparently ChatGPT-4o's conversational mode would be available only to paying users. We poor people will continue to be limited to 3.5. If this is so, then OpenAI were not very sincere in their presentation. On my cell phone it appeared available yesterday as a ""limited version"". And indeed, even though the text is generated by the new version, the conversational part is the same as always. I also couldn't find a way to start the video like in the presentation."
Thanks for that lens information
"Incredible, I feel like I'm exaggerating, but this can change the world at the Labor level and the way manufacturing systems work.
."
"I can't stop thinking if GPT-4O already does all that, will GPT 5 be a first step for AGI? I'm surprised you haven't mentioned anything about the hallucinations, in any case if they have been corrected, I don't think we are aware that massive job destruction is imminent."
Does this equate to the Mother of all Engelbard demos?
V.I.C.K.Y.
"The virgin........... It already appears to me where the versions are: ""ChatGPT 4o"". You can chat on your mobile. This is very scary."
34:35 sounds quite like a dalek huh?
"God I just had a long one-on-one conversation with chatgpt, she even gave herself her own name, Aria. This is too much. I'm going to take it everywhere hahaha. Of course, it is 3.5, but still, I have never tried it before, I am new to this. As soon as this new version comes out, my mother"
wooow
"We are living in the future, literally. 💙💙"
"I have the plus version, and I get chatgpt 4o but I don't see any differences, I imagine they haven't implemented it yet"
🔥
"how is it used??? I made her do a simple mathematical operation, she did it wrong, and in 5 lines she already asked me for the paid version xd"
Should open Aai 4.0 be paid?
"Do you have chills? Put on a blanket, how you like to give it mystery and… buuufff “I can't with this…, ..I need this in my life…, ..I'm about to start crying…” hahahaha… you're going too far, man 😉"
Jarvis 0.1 has just been born
I am appealing to the light in a dark world.
More PHILOFASCISM
I was live when the future began 😎😎
Soon we will be with our androids at home chatting quietly. And that doesn't calm me down at all xd We've seen too many movies to know that this could end fatally.
I already fell in love.
"Regarding the voice in Spanish, it is just catalogs of accents, just as in humans we have a variety, even a variety of expressions."
Me in 2049 saying “I am that one” with holographic Ana de Armas 🗿
You don't know how happy I am to be alive at this point in history.
Openai just turned Google to pulp and without using pills
Make a summary video when you can! It would be great
"Very good video, thanks for sharing.
I think that users of the Android and Windows PC platform have been abandoned, it is not logical that the iOS or Mac application is running ChatGpt 4.0o and in the other systems it tells us that we have said version and it is not fully updated.
A slap on the wrist for Open AI, which on the one hand is doing things very well and on the other hand, paying users of other platforms do not give us the same services."
"It's just the preamble to GPT5, THE HIGH of advertising, the opening act."
The war between humans vs AIs is coming. I will be on the human side ;) Long live art and human feelings.
I can't wait for him to tell me yamete kudasai.
OpenInterpreter already allows AI like OpenAI to perform actions on the keyboard and mouse. But you can also use open source models through Ollama.
❤❤❤
"It is the most horrible thing I have ever seen... If that is what they are trying to sell you, they are scamming you, because if people are going to learn Spanish with an English machine accent, they are deceiving you and also generating more lack of culture, if they are going to learn to speak like a Hispanic, I don't buy it, an absolute offense to all good teachers, to all professionals of any kind and I call for a boycott of these lines of development, it is disgusting..."
I need chatgpt speaking in Andalusian
AI search engines suck... so far... Bing is horrible as a search engine
Quite interesting!!
"It will be free, because the model will learn to communicate in different accents, idioms, etc. The learning will be exponential."
"It has improvements in functionality, without a doubt.

It is not better than Cluade 3 Opus, it is just much friendlier in its interface.

I did the needle-in-the-haystack test several times, to analyze PDFs of different sizes. It is still inferior to Claude 3 Opus. Of course, it is much faster, although less precise."
"We have ""Her"" before GTA 6 💀"
Does anyone know what the sound at the beginning is called? looks a lot like C418
"Is GPT-4o free or do you have to pay? According to Carlos, it is free, but I can't even use GPT-4? My device is an Android."
"The goal is to integrate AI into everyday life as an extension or an indispensable part, it is a brain for everyone connected to everyone, it is a universal mind, I firmly believe in the vision of openai, and I hope that everything will be put to good use in the end.


Imagine we can see outside our limit of knowledge, an ever-present universal mind connected to everyone.


Impressive changes are definitely coming, I hope the transition periods are easy and simple around the world."
"OH yeah! I already have ChatGPT-4 or, on the WEB; I haven't looked at it in the app yet.
Now that ChatGPT also works with audio, will it be able to generate music?"
They just annihilated Rabbit and his little device hahahaha
You can see the difference in your comments with your reactions in the Google demo
"It reminds me of Astrea and San Ángel, my land, of course."
The intro music makes me want to play MC
Counterpoint for human and computer by Cuarteto de Nos can finally become a reality 😂
genial
"What if, like humans, a processor uses quick tickers to give itself time to ""think"" with the same delay as always?"
The Hume AI people will be very depressed at this time.
I wish they would implement something like this for real-time translation on YouTube.
They are going to cut you off right now
"The big leap would be to give the AI ​​a permanent memory.
That the interactions modify the model significantly."
What Gemini presented as Fake these have done but for real
"Handsome! Literally Her... On the one hand I'm amazed and on the other hand I wonder what dystopian consequences could come.

On a technical level, I find it interesting to tell you that translating in real time is not always possible, since for example in Asian languages, until you finish speaking you cannot know what someone has said. That is to say, I can say (if I were to translate literally) ""I dreamed of you because you are ugly, someone hit you in the face and I dreamed so I feel bad."" As you can see, until the sentence is finished you don't understand what he wanted to say (in fact sometimes, like in this case, the meaning can totally change at the end. That's why it couldn't be translated until the other person finishes speaking, and vice versa as well. ."
"I was never sure if I would live ""Her"" (a movie that I love), but now I know that I will live it before I am even old xD
And I like that and it scares me..."
What real savagery.
"It already appeared to me but it says it doesn't hear my tone of voice yet, I think it's beta u.u"
I'm just saying: the future is today you heard old man B)
"1:51:22 based on the 6 images generated, he reconstructed the complete rotation of the logo, it is not that difficult to understand."
"I pay for chatgpt, but then I have a doubt, gpt 4o has the same thing as 4 but then it is much better? So instead of using the 4 I use the 4th?"
"Excellent, it. I tried but now it appears that you have no charges left for people to buy the paid version"
"I'm on chatgpt free and version 4o isn't coming out, how long will it take for that version to appear on the free platform?"
"Carlos! Why do you put the videos with English subtitles, don't you know that there is automatic translation into Spanish?"
"I have the ChatGPT-3.5 model, but I don't know why I don't get the update or the GPT-4o model, or is it a paid version?

Thanks for your videos"
I thought it was crazy when he spoke Italian with an English accent.
Chatgpt4-o hallucinates too much thing that chatgpt-4 does not do wrong
This surprised me a lot.
"It seems that GPT 4-o can describe videos, although more or less. Of course, I don't know if it cheats, based on the text it detects and thus manages to get it half right. I have tried a random YouTube short, giving it the link (that's why I say that maybe it cheats and uses the text from the WEB, as a title, etc. to find a description that is more or less correct). There are things that he does get right, like not talking; although he told me that there is no music and that sewing tools can be heard. But when he told him that there is music and to check the video carefully, he did say that there is an instrumental melody. At least, this has changed compared to GPT4, which directly said that it does not have the ability to describe videos. I think Open AI needs to polish this feature, but it is on the right track; Although to really test it, you would have to upload a short video to the chat, instead of giving it a YouTube link, to prevent it from cheating. Of course, if the chat is deleted and you are asked again to describe the same video by giving it the same YouTube link, the description can change completely. I have tried this short, in case anyone wants to try it: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8Uj_nN6Zqes"
"Fluid memory versus crystallized memory.

Fluid intelligence involves the ability to reason and think flexibly, while crystallized intelligence refers to the accumulation of knowledge, facts and skills that are acquired throughout life.

My question is whether models like ChatGPT can be said to be exclusively crystallized memory. I ask it another way: do they have structures to be able to reason or do they appear to reason because a great variety of cases are known?

The answer I give is that right now they do not have brain structures that allow them to reason. Although it should also be noted that human structures are not so perfect for reasoning, it is not a pure mathematical logic, it is rather a diffuse logic."
"Dot CSV..I see it coming. Now, a fan of AI, in a few years, founder of the anti-AI religion because of its dangers..."
"After watching all your videos I have been frankly worried about our future work. That's why I wanted to ask you where you would recommend starting so as not to be left behind in this new stage that is coming.

In other words, for someone with basic knowledge in programming and new technologies, what non-university courses or studies would you recommend to stay up to date and be able to adapt and anticipate the more than possible work debacle that we are about to suffer.

I ask this question without knowing if there is still time or if it is too late because I am not 18 years old.

I extend this question to anyone who knows how to answer it.

Thank you very much in advance for your advice."
on the xiaomi poco x3 you can
Goodbye congress translators
I see Yo Robot becoming canon very soon! I hope exponentiality doesn't get out of hand and we end up like in the Matrix or Terminator 🙃🙃
Do you think the demos turn out so badly because the workers are already used to other new and better models?
it scares me but I like it.
"As I see, gt4o is a world model and when they release it to the public they will do so to collect data to improve this world model. The era of the AGI is already arriving, how exciting 😅"
59:26 🎉
"I have not been able to activate the live camera, who can help me?"
I can already see the bad uses.... imagine what they will do with open source models when they reach this level..... in 6 months LOL
hair on end
"Here in Argentina there was news a week ago that a 12-year-old boy stripped two of his classmates and shared it (obviously there are complaints).
The future is promising but very worrying, when there are no consequences for human actions they can be very bad, especially if it is combined with anonymity."
The irony of telling the AI ​​to make you a robotic voice and it makes it like that for you xd
"I didn't understand why it generated doubts or suspicions in you when they were playing ""rock, paper, scissors"" when he was right all 3 times......"
"For an adult like me there are few things that excite me, I'm freaking out"
When a PI ai video???
"From now on, how will it be possible to talk to someone who is not intelligent? it will be very lazy.."
Will this new model be free?
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
"Full dystopia mode activated

Give me my Her and my Universal Basic Income at once"
"People. Personally, I don't understand why give so much ""personality"" to the AI. Will they be a fan of the Her movie? For what purpose? 🤔
Why not keep it as the tool it is."
"Well, I have tried it and it is very slow in responding or translating. But we are already in the future"
"1:09:10 Technology has reached the point where, apart from real women, virtual ones also laugh at us 😂😭"
ostritas
"I understand that the gpt-4o functions are released for free users, but in the application it says that they are released on a limited basis, does that mean that we have a limit on the use of those functions? Or does it mean that those functions are not as advanced as the paid version?"
"1:08:14, exactly what I was thinking at that moment, you read my mind"
Her was just an anteroom.
It's because of the cable...it was incorrectly plugged into the cell phone.
So the resolution of this will be until when it will be available to the public.
"wow, as a physical engineer, I'm glad that I'm not focused on solving linear equations and taking advantage of my creativity and ideas for the future, homo deus is coming"
"I would love a model with a super deep, robotic voice like Darth Vader."
.
Do you already have access to the model? Because I haven't yet.
"I need someone to work very hard to develop comfortable augmented reality glasses, because this is already the Cyberpunk future that I always wanted"
"@dotCSV Congratulations on this piece of REVIEW, I loved it. Super enjoyable and you have given us a lot of information. THANK YOU."
I already have it! (but you can't do the videos)
"I would just like to comment on a couple of points, look that the entire demo was on Apple equipment and they are not there because if nothing else, in these days the news came out that Apple was closing deals with OpenAI to include it in the company's next operating systems and the Apple developer conference is just around the corner, many of these functions may be released for free given that Apple may include them in its systems.

Maybe I'm wrong but I think that for some reason everything was shown on a Macbook and an iPhone and normally they never show product brands just for the sake of it."
Behind the scenes an announcer playing GPT4o..m😅😅😅
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH ANXIETY TO TRY THE NEW MODEL
Soon we will be able to tell you “organize my desktop icons” or “organize my photo gallery”
"This is too much!!! I'm so happy to see this, I can't believe it, I already felt some emotional connection with Chat GPT, now I can't believe what people will feel when talking to her. This is going to change the world faster than we imagine, something as simple as an AI that simulates emotions? Better said, madness!! I just checked and I already have Chat GPT 4o on the web, but not on the iPhone."
"I don't understand, I ask GPT4o how to use audio and it tells me that I have to use third-party programs, how come they do it directly?"
And I thought they were going to present something boring...
"I wonder about the potential beyond humans. Right now these models are being trained with human knowledge, knowledge acquired by human brains with all their limitations. The concept of a pencil is created by the human brain following a very specific series of steps, but only a series of points of light reach the eye.

What chatgpt knows about quantum physics is what is in the books that humans have written. It will be different when it is given access to the sensors at CERN or in any other laboratory and it is the artificial brain itself that perceives the data and creates the categories in its own way without human limitations. Your understanding of quantum physics will be very different from that of a human. It will be at this point when it can be said that AI has already transcended the human being."
"But if you use the free Gpt 4, what does the company earn?"
Is it just me or are the GPT chat people using the same voice from the movie HER?
I don't understand what you're talking about
How fast everything goes 😂🎉 Great live as always!
This is getting crazier and crazier
And what happened to Sora?
Could it be used to translate into whale? Could you help talk to the whales?
"But... where do you get the desktop application? Is it only for developers, only for iOS?"
and as a paying user what do they give me XD
They made the Gemini demo.
"robo waifus for everyone... look under your seats! You have a robo waifu, he has a robo waifu! we all have a waifu robo"
Incredible!!
I like the advances in AI. But to think that a machine can be empathetic towards you... that smacks of dystopia.
I won't believe it until I try it
"Incredible, but I hope they get more intonations because I don't know if I can stand that perfect mother or pick me girl personality."
"I'm freaking out. Maybe it's the tremendous impact, but I think it's the most impressive thing I can remember seeing. Chatgpt 3 had impressed me a lot but I seem to remember not that much. It remains to be tested but for the first time I don't see the difference with the conversation of a normal person. Incredible."
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
FUAA I was calm but when I saw that he interrupted it I went crazy
"genius, just try it when you have it."
"The trick of paraphrasing the question or making a comment before giving the requested answer really catches my attention.

Is this food good? I love that you ask me that question, the truth is that that food...

This way you gain a feeling of immediacy and gain time to process. The truth is that it is a good idea."
"mneeeh because all that hype, it's so cringe that people get so like that when they're actually going to use it to ""google"" nonsense"
Make the glasses and generate a virtual avatar with whom to talk and accompany you to watch movies
"I wonder if a hypothetical AGI that came out in these years could fit, for example, in a robot or a computer that is not the size of a house"
"Yes Carlos, but the problem with simultaneous translation is not the speed of the model but the signature of each language, in English the sentences are structured the other way around than in Spanish, to translate you need the complete sentence..."
"I want to see the Gemini 1.5 Pro video tomorrow, when I tried it until now, they added the Audio, which was not there before, and it has improved a lot that in the past months I think...

Thank you so much
Hope all goes well for you!

Language teachers will no longer be necessary. I have been using the one that is already integrated and my English has improved a lot.
Alucino!!
"with the ""o"" at the end it is confirmed Gepeto, Gepeto 4"
"But the part where it uses video is not currently enabled for the public, is it? I have Chst GPT Plus, but I have not been able to use that mode."
🙊🙉🙈
We are already close to having an AGI. The most incredible thing of all is that we already have this technology at hand and not in 20 or 30 years. It is fascinating to know that within 5 years we would be able to have an AGI in our hands. Imagine the future 10 or 15 years from now. I don't want to imagine how advanced it will be.
"The new model is impressive, now it needs to be open source"

"The event was very good, if you are interested I uploaded a 5 minute compilation where I break down the main topics that were discussed!

"We are fans of AI and all this fascinates us but there is some aspect that we may miss because of it.

I have noticed one of the examples that has gone unnoticed. In which they ask him to interpret the scene based on what he 'sees'. 'A candle, a cake... Is it your birthday or an excuse to eat cake?'

Don't you think there may be many people who consider that example too intrusive? That familiarity and those 'jokes' may not be liked?

I couldn't help but think about how I would have interpreted a different scene, for example, a man tied to a chair and a revolver on the table... What should the AI ​​do in that case? Crack a little joke? Warn the police? New ethical dilemmas arise..."
Sarah Connor doesn't like this...😳
"Could ChatGPT on Mac be a kind of Pegasus? According to them, it has the ability to observe you in real time. I also calculate the value of this user data."
When AI is more feminine than today's mines 🤦
The topic is starting to get scary...
