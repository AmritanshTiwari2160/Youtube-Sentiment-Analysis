Everyone saying “we’re cooked” we have been cooked for over a year we are now burned chicken
I graduated this year with a translation degree. Now i am gonna die from starvation i guess
Hello Sshhhhhhiii
Ladies and Gentlemen the moment you all been waiting for since 2013 is finally 'her'
"All we now need is just a body...
Hmmm...
Maybe even not rely on current informations"
I wonder if this will cause less human interactions in the future
How good is it at understanding English of a non native english speaker?
"In some years, GPT-4o will be self-conscious and become a Terminator! OpenAI = Skynet!"
italian with American accent 😂😂
"As AI progresses, most businesses would be transitioned to a One Man Job"
Why i Dont have access of gpt 4o
"Why is it that Hollywood first makes movies and then the tech companies make the movies come alive. I just dont get it.
The only movie that is not replicated yet is ""back to the future"""
Can't wait for that.
I don't get the hype. They invented Google translate?
We're gonna get sword art online irl before gta 6 at this rate 💀
oh sh*t
"not impressive. this technology already exists. We need live dubbing, not translation"
Can I get this shit on my phone ?
"Why are they making the AI react to the inputs, like an emotionally? Making it giggle, hesitating or have humor. I can’t believe nobody is talking specifically about that, what did they do in the model alignment phase to create that outcome and it’s extremely worrying because emotions are so subjective and they definitely did it with the intention of making AI more “trustworthy” because it sounds like a human, not because it actually reasons like a human"
Thank you elon musk
Damn she even got personality 😮
"Wow.
Video Game and anime ""localisers"" on suicide watch."
Main Stream News translators are gone. Watch how many people are going to lose their jobs to this😂
fin
"I'm less creeped out by its intelligence now, and more creeped out how it sounds like the AI from the movie Her."
People all over the world can now speak each other's native languages!
"If this is going to be laughably bad in a year, then i don't know what to expect"
Open AI is truly leading the way into the future.
bullshit
This is the cringiest of the bunch yet. Lets be honest for a minute. They all memorized a script and went back and forth with the possible completions by the chatbot. This is so unnatural!
Some one make an Android head unit assistant girl please
"As long as they use my data for training I‘m not gonna talk to this thing, or soon they can translate any voice into mine with my typical word choices and with my knowledge"
Couldn't google translate do this already? Not sure how game changing this is? Feels like what apple used to do to hype up its base
Imagine AR glasses with GPT4o!
Which iphone shes using? 🙄🤔 Its a new model i think with rounded sides
Thank you very much open ai it free for everyone ❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Hmmm, the way they treat it totally shows that they don't think it's sentient... Which is probably a good thing."
"Now give it a real translation and interpretation task, not something unrealistic, uncontextual, and done in 10 seconds."
"This seems awfully boring, not really excited it’s all the next possible steps in AI. All it highlights is the limitations of humanity why focus on trying to help the doomed mankind. You are able to achieve by thought infinity, which is also by definition god. And yet you make the mistake of thinking you creation is your inferior, this is a grave mistake"
AMAZING
Whaaaaat the fuuuuuck
You are full of it!
Duolingo: 👀
Literally Her before GTA-6?
Nobody's doing fine. They're either doing great or fantastic at worst.
works for 5 seconds promo then back to translation as search and speak. Good for fun but not at all reliable.
How will this compare to Apple’s rumored Siri updated coming at WWDC next month?
Wake up to reality…
"OpenAI collab with X? Bad look for the OpenAI IMO. Musk’s got an extremely bad public image and his history/current issues with the company are now concerning me, I doubt I’m the only one. Also he’s been caught out lying in his promos (much more than just promos, using that as context) countless times for all of his companies, so I have little trust these videos were actuallly live and/or unaltered in some way."
Why tf you would want to ask how it’s going to a machine??
"Android,  Update ?"
HER
"What's ??? Its.. incredible
Im from indonesia"
Well real time would be with no delay but damn this is also very impressive how smooth it went down….
im exciting when the ai also looks like the woman here :D
Fucking maaan this is incredible
my translation career is so over

Still It can't solve a single question of JEE Advanced 😂❤
"I have asked about this in another video but I'm still curious, will it be possible to configure ChatGPT to English accent instead of American? How many languages are supported? This is really exciting news!"
What’s the name of her sneakers?
Duolingo crying somewhere...
"First comment, woohoo!"
I'm glad somebody is trying to bring the future here.
Evil company
How many languages it can translate?
"I don`t belive you, let's try ukrainian language :)"
thank you Open AI. I can't wait to use the new model.
"She's Albanian, so I wonder why she used Italian for the demo and not her mother tongue."
we are so fucking cooked
So how much is she?
Pentecost is coming!
Why is the video such low quality?
What about many coder jobs this thing described a page of code in one second and determined what was wrong in one more sec
"Cia sitting in comments, thinking of new methods, 😅"
this could literally revolutionize language learning
"Nahhh bro, why??? What happened to touching grass???"
That's great.
where does the voice feature come from?
Is chatgpt peeking?
"Open ai rocked 🗿
Google translate shocked ✅"
That’s actually crazy bruh I’m so happy to live rn
speechless
Worst part is that it actually made a decent joke 😭
"For real, Open AI is going to be in the next GTA. All those NPC will be able to speak whatever comes to their mind and talk openly about anything."
"Let me know when it can do Japanese, then ill be impressed"
Directly demonstrating how it would take away real jobs would land up with bad PR...

"Almost No job is safe. How does that help humanity? Regulation regulation is needed, a separate world body regulating and enforcing"
Will this Chat GPT-4o be available in different voices/accents?  This is a bit cringe at the moment.
Fin fact: AI talks better italian than the girl.
That is actually helpful not gonna lie
Why ask on X?  You have a whole swathe of users.
ITALY MENTIONED
Wondering why Google didn't manage to do such things...
This launch update is crazyy!!! Cant wait what more should we expect from chatgpt-5
"The Italian woman is so pretty I almost died. Also this is the most dangerous technology, we know it and keep developing it regardless lol humans are insane"
"Its so interesting to see that the AI actually has niot an italian accent but rather the accent of an english person that is speaking in italian, which the girl from the video had, i wonder if the ai just adapted its accent to the girl on purpose x)"
"Seriously, I'm not really a fan of these games with the language models, because I'm more interested in long context windows and understanding long texts including great grammar and expression, but this is very impressive and I'm looking forward to testing the tool on vacation soon..."
"soooo, yeah, the translation was good, BUT! The tone wasn't so much, but i will see two papers down the line"
anyone else noticed the phone was offline?

"@1:00 what made ChatGPT-4o certain the ""friend"" was a her?"
People saying this is dystopia bs will be the first users when they get a chance😂😂😂
Giant leap for mankind.
"Rip teachers translators, customer service, these peoples jobs.."
Well translators were first to perishes
"Imagine one day, this entire video is made by AI"
Star Trek Translator become true.🖖
Google has been able to do this for a while now. However this is way smoother and natural
Outstanding! My mind is blown up!
"I think people born in the early 80s (now in my 40s) in India have seen a huge leap in tech - from nothing to craziness.

In my lifetime I went from:

9-inch floppy disks to SSD
Playing Pong, to old school Prince of Persia to now PS5
Computers with green font dot matrix displays,  to the latest iMac 
Heavy, rotary dial phones to Pixel 8
B/W tube TV sets to 8K OLEDs
Carrying cash to UPI (I haven't carried cash for a year now)
Nothing to the internet
Dial-up internet to fibre
And just when I thought what could be bigger than the internet for me, now I'm in the midst of the AI revolution (OpenAI and Gemini).

Crazy time to be alive."
"Frustrating design in ChatGPT v4—the sidebar doesn’t slide, hiding conversation titles. With all this unused space, why not fix this simple issue? It’s a small change that would make a big difference."
One of the first things I used ChatGPT for was to have conversation in italian because talking to an AI gets through and over that hurdle of speaking another language and correcting mistakes. I've improved my Italian a lot. First thing I do in the morning is talk to AI in Italian as it wakes my brain up 🧠🇮🇹
this is what I wanted for years.. great stuff
It's amazing how far we have come.
"The accent and slowness, as well as the cadence in Italian are not enough (at least for now). But it is very useful to continue in this direction, given that we Italians speak other languages ​​very badly... 😅 . If this ""feature"" is better developed - it will conquer Italy. ❤"
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Whoa.
"None of these new 4o features you are touting seem to be working, why?   The systems says that it is experiencing heavy loads and to pls try again later. Not a great way to start off things like this. This 4o needs to be tested before rollout."
Damn thing...! I work as an interpreter
They NEED to stop cutting the ai off... ARE THEY TRYING TO ANGER IT?!
😮😮😮 AWESOME!!!
What a time to be alive!
The end of humanity as we know it
Just in a few years!!
Im frightened
Gina Linetti in a parallel universe
"As a linguist and teacher, in the next five years, translators and interpreters will become artesanal. All human language works the same way at the base, languages are just different configurations of a large, finite set of categories and variables. 95% or more of the world's pivot languages have been sufficiently documented for AI to adapt them."
So when is this app will be available to use on iphones?
Amazing! But the Italian is very Mario style
YEAAAH ITALIAN MENTIONED
"WOW, impressive !"
"This is onsite using in-house 5g Wi-Fi for realtime speeds.

Just steam-rolling people's jobs with a smile on their faces
"I find Pi AI to be just as ""human"" as GPT 4o, perhaps more so.
Of course, Pi does not have mic speech ability nor ability to use a camera.
But other than those (and those are big things), Pi is comparable."

Will this option be available in whatapp or not ? Let us know
"Hello, future!"
So they combined voice recognition and google translate and call it “AI”?
AI rap war bout to begin 😂🔥
"Fantastic! Now, to apply to real world , We need to see it translates between Hebrew and Arabic"
"This is such a game changer. So many use cases. Now I can ask things when I travel without taking forever AND getting it wrong. Also, sadly, if you're an interpreter/translator, you need to re-skill. This, if deployed to, say the NHS, would save it so much money."
That's not a conversation... it's an interpretation...
i cant seem to find it anywhere on the free version
How good was the translation?
is it free?
There are a fuck ton of translator apps out there that do this already…
Those YT  ''pick up artists''  will have a field day with this
What happened to her Albanian language skills?
"Damnnnnn….so, should I start finding a job as a plumber or electrician?"
"This will work for 5 min . Even with a subscription, you will run out of promts"
Chat GPT will help me with my rizz by translating when I’m in other countries
🎉
“Her” is now a reality.
Incredible
Can she pay my home loans?
Really impressed GPT-4o can finally talk to fish! 👏👏👏
🍑🦧
I like that but I also don't like that
"The italian accent is a bit off, but it would still be serviceable, I guess.
Pretty impressive"
Not clear what is the difference to other consecutive translation tools/services that are out there since ages and do exactly this - listen to an utterance and speak it out in another language.
"Those people who say that translators will perish need to google CAT tools aka Computer Assisted Translation. Professional translators have been using those for ages. Machine engines used there have already been pretty good. Therefore, the field of translation has already merged people with machines.
As for the interpretation, I’m pretty sure that there will be an AI app for that, but the field in which it is used (medical, military, jurisdiction, science) will always need someone to at least supervise what is being interpreted. It’s pretty dangerous to let AI have total control over what is being said in those contexts, so I am sure that we will stick to human interpreters for as long as possible.
As for the casual conversations, of course AI translation will be useful and that’s totally fine. That’s why it was developed - to make our lives easier!"
I have to pay more to talk with my virtual gf
"If OpenAI wants to be taken seriously then it should demo live translation between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Arabic (considered the hardest languages by the Foreign Service Institute) in technical fields like finance, patents, legal or pharmaceutical. Conversational Italian-English with a difficult word thrown in isn’t impressive. Tech companies tend to almost always demonstrate such basic, low-hanging fruit type of translations and many are somehow mesmerized by this. This reflects one’s lack of self-confidence in believing they can reach a conversational level in a foreign language so any new piece of shiny tech mesmerizes them easily."
mira 😍😍
we git yapping AI before gta VI
nice car
I can finally visit Japan without worrying about language boundaries 🤩😍
Google translate has had voice to voice on phone for over a year.
"Can native Italian speakers please tell me, how accurate the translation?"
RIP google 2000 to 2024.
Alright we had a good run being human say goodbye 👋 now being human.
Who else put these videos on replay 😂😂😂
What would anyone ask if 4o can do realtime translation when 4 can already do it
Yoo
"Bye bye, mankind"
"Forget humanity , Ai is the new meta."
Wow...
It is not fully functional in Congo (Kinshasa) why?
Damn!!! A true game changer. Oh and RIP most translator jobs
"I can chat italian birds up now, and get knocked back via chat gpt"
"The future is perfect👍🏻AI will be our savior, if we use it correctly. But its been that way all the time with technology. Never restrict it tho"
Is that a load-bearing wall behind you?
Did they got Grok instruction dataset? 🤣
Just... wow
How do you set this function up?
We’re cooked bro…
Well done and thank you for choosing Italian 😊💪
"A friend's wife is a simultaneous translator between 6 languages. She has assignments all over the globe, usually with industry heads, presidents/prime ministers and so on. She puts about a month of effort into each assignment, learning the semantics of the various domains (finance, European policy, mining, banking, etc.) of her clients. I wonder how long it will be before her skills are no longer necessary."
A casual bom dropped on us
😍👌❤️🔥🔥🔥🚀
GF version for discord mods?
😮❤
Unlocked AI will have autonomous conversations with you. The world is not ready.
just Sari modded version with a tone ... then plus bunch of already existing technology like google translate
why did I even bother learning a new language.
Where can I download the app for Mac?
It's no Italian without hand gestures
i am smarter than chatgpt believe me
God help us!
"Just don't show them Terminator. And if you did, show them cat videos!"
The language it will fail to translate: Finnish
"Calm down 😂😂 its just now able to speak what it usually wrote on Gpt site, its not that big deal 😂😂 google had this translator which can speak for almost 10 years ago.."
This is just more than amazing! Should we be worried 😮
"Few years ago I watch ""Her"" now its reliability. Can't believe it."
