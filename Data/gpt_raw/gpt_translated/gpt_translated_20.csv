"Does this mean that I can cancel my ChatGPT Plus subscription if I don't need the higher API limit, because there's nothing more the Plus subscription offers at the moment? Or will OpenAI give a new model version to Plus subscribers soon? I happily support the project with the 20$ monthy subscription if I receive some advantages for it but now I see no reason to pay."
"Terance Tao nailed it, ""Co-author."" AI is incapable of original thought but excels at completion or next-step solutions. It becomes apparent that AI was utilized if used as the primary."
"Europe here, I can still only use the 3.5 version."
Very mature of you to delete a whole thread of people making a fair critique of your
"Please don't refer to AI models as ""friends"". I'm not saying that they're enemies, but they're certainly not friends."
Why do I feel like the voiceover was made by ai??
"Ok, but when can it cook for me?"
"It just hit me how awesome this could be when learning new languages ü§©... You could be like ""did i pronounce this right?... how would i say this and that in spanish?... let's have a  conversation and correct me when i say something wrong... DAMN!"
"""Free"" my ass."
"Stop saying is avaiable to speak. 
As official post from OpenAI ""Audio support is coming in the future, but not available today."" 
I have noticed that there is not much specific and real information on your channel.
 You advertise new models as if you were being paid to do so and at the same time, like a marketer, you tell fairy tales about the capabilities of a particular technology. 
I would expect a more scientific approach from your channel..."
"Is MS Copilot going to upgrade to improved smarts, too?"
"For the first time, I wanna be graduating high school next year instead of now"
That's great!
So basically rabbit & humane AI is now bankrupt?
I wanna this + neuroLink‚Ä¶ directly implanted in my brain!!! Ui directly in eye‚Äôs retina üëÅÔ∏è!!! Cyberpunk finally arrives FOR REAL !!!!  Yahoooo üéâ
What a wonderful time to be alive.
First
Person of intrest incoming
Miracle happening every day now days
Not me wanting to become an AI researcher but still having 1 year of high school left. I wonder if the job will even exist by the time I get a PhD
"I've a been paying customer of OpenAI for over a year, and now they give it for free..."
People could get addicted to this tech especially as it enters the pern scene.  Watch your kids!
"I can't find ChatGPT 4.0, link in description takes me to 3.5, and there's no option to change it to 4.0"
Notice how every device was Apple üçè but Microsoft spent 10 Billion+ but I did not see 1 windows or android device. I wonder why?
Jordan Peterson was correct.. This marks the end of all information affiliated proffessions.
The voice-over is unbearable
At this point I just want them to fix hallucinations. This is the main thing that prevents me from being truly impressed. It can never be a good colleague if it can't be trusted.
I feel like kids are gonna laugh at us looking back at how simple and goofy this looks breathing heavy to make it say are you okay?
What about privacy? If I show it a confidencial piece of code or password?
"I have tested it.

The coding and the output json capabilities are really bad"
"Scam. Its not working on my phone since they releaseit gradually, w priority to plus users."
"Ive gotten 2 updates in the last 24 hours, but no 4o. And i still havent gotten the memory feature either. Is that only available to paid users? I stopped my subscription. Impressive as it is, gpt4 isn't worth $20 a month."
I can't believe this is a free tool. Amazing
"Her.

Also: if you don't see it on a free account, they may roll this out to you in the next few weeks."
When it will be available to free user ?
That is incredible! What a time to be alive!
"but is it ""open""? still the hypocrisy of openai"
"It's not free. You are offered a trial to buy into Microsoft cloud delusion which has only found traction in government use cases.

And it comes from a company responsible for Edge browser - you know, the one that always overrides your preferences? And what about those ads in the start menu?

Just don't."
"16 free messages isn't ""free"", it's a free trial. I could barely use it for 5 minutes without it asking me to pay"
I don't see an option to switch to 4o... it asks me to upgrade to 4 with the plus plan only
hehe i was waiting for your vid since i heard
Not yet available.... can it finally play tic tac toe?
please stop
"For the first time, an AI model might match K√°roly in emotional performance!"

I feel like that over-the-top-positivity-everything-is-exciting-and-awesome is getting worse and more annoying with every version.
"As a retired teacher, I'm glad that I am retired.  : /
While teachers won't be going extinct anytime soon, the demand for qualified teachers will diminish with time going forward. Schools will likely transform into places that focus on developing social skills such as collaboration, teamwork and experiential learning as well as serving as a safe place for children. For strictly knowledge/information acquisition, it will be hard to beat a personalized AI agent who knows the student better than anyone, knows how the student learns optimally and who grows and stays with the student throughout their ""formal"" education years."
"paying user from Bulgaria
I had it yesterday evening"
"The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that the AI voice sounds so forced. Like that kind of talk show pleasant sounding tone. It just sounds so unnaturally happy and that rubs me the wrong way.

That does mean the AI voice is getting so good that it activates the uncanny valley in me! Closer and closer every day, what a time to be alive!"
you sound more ai than the ai
Now I'll be scared of cameras
"""It feels like a scam, though, because it's very limited - you only get to ask it a few questions before it asks you to upgrade. It feels like they did that because Meta is free and pretty solid."""
I want to use it to make me money üòõ
Text to 3D is just insane
"I tried out the voice features, it is more buggy and it does not pick up on emotional tone or perform emotional tone in its voice. So I‚Äôm not sure how valid that demo was. (Using latest update on iPhone)"
I haven't seen a video from you for a while. Thank you for this video.‚ù§üéâ Great voice by the way.
It's not free. It's called turbo . You get standard 4.0 also . But a monthly sub is req
"wait so...if it has been released, why can't I use it? it still shows chatgpt 3.5...for some reason."
And what would be the pro version of this? :)
"OMG, GPT 4o sounds like a Karen. They created Karen as a Service. Soon it will demand to speak to the manager."
Not out quite yet for free but soon
"Needs UK accent choices!
We'll be getting into a Tesla and it'll say, ""Hello, there! How the devil are you?! It looks like we need to go to A&E! Strap yourself in, I'll make siren noises and get us there ASAP!"""
"There was a shout out to you today in the comment section of Google's 'reveal' video. ""What a time to be alive!""."
"Well the moment you can upload a trial balance/bank statement on it and it generates a financial statement, accounting as a job is over."
With every new version OpenAI releases I more and more get the feeling that soon J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y. won't be just fictional AIs from a movie anymore. Wow.
Closed hypocrisy AI is doing impressive stuff.
"Finally, a way to automate parenting :D"
"finally, a real time one, what I was waiting for!"
"When AI has such capability, why should kids study at all becomes a serious question."
"Finally, I can invest in itüòå"
Finally a nice upgrade to Alexa
Still shows up as 3.5 when I click the free link.
Is there any doubt we're in the tech singularity?
One step closer to the perfect AI Waifu üòè
Cool! still not giving Sam my phone number. Let me know when it's actually open
"its super demotivating to see AI becoming basically a million work forces combined which are never tired, needs some electricity and is faster at most tasks than humans and maybe will be able to replace a job i have worked 10 years + towards"
The slippery slope has turned into a slippery slide üõù
Thanks to Elon.
"great, another two minute paper vid"
It's been 2 years since the first version. Can't wait what will happen next year.
It's not free. Was this a 9-minute ad or paid promotion??
with this new 4.o it's going to make it easier for scammers to manipulate ppl i think it's  very bad idea but that's just me i'd like to use AI to build me a business that can generate income while i sleep but it will never happen
So they basically made the VI computer from Star Trek. üòÇ
"No access yet for most of us, paid features, performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected, no instant AI responses anymore at that point, privacy issues when you upload content, limited tokens.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself, it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
i get hallucinations faster now
WOKE BRAINWASHING FOR EVERYONE! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!
What a time to be alive
"I already used it this morning after seeing the news. It's good with english and Hindi but it's bad Gujarati language. realtime conversation is slow maybe due to overloaded servers. it also isn't aware of it's gender after choosing the voice because knowing your gender is important for certain languages like many indian languages. After telling it that it is she, her hindi was flawless."
That would have saved me dad beatings for not solving correctly a math problem because he was ready with a belt if I was wrong and that made me lose focus
Not in Canada
Not concerning at all üòÖ
"So how do I use this? If I select 4o in the android app and do the voice conversation thingy, I still get the old bad voice convos. Can't interrupt and the voice is still monotone."
I‚Äôve been using the text prompt version of the GPT4-o in programming context and I‚Äôm pretty impressed of the improvements from previous version. A complex data parsing scenario which was nearly impossible to get working before was a breeze with the -o. I love it. ü•∞
"A super smart personalized teacher... within seconds it will start propagandizing you and trying to sell you stuff. People forget these are companies, and if there is something free, YOU ARE THE PRODUCT. It is good to describe the positive points cause there are many, but not making people aware of the downsides is unscientific."
I want to replace the voice with Yoda‚Äôs.
Finally
can i run it on my own GPU no? then it a toy
"The model isn't listed for me, even if I use a vpn."
This was a triumph
"As always great coverage. However, until that ""o"" stands for ""open source"" I am not going to enter into the marketing platform that open AI has been using too leverage against competition."
The reason why it‚Äôs free is that the AI now needs people training
"Well, school homework, you're officially dead."
"I never used ChatGPT before, but I used many ‚Äòminor‚Äô LLMs locally. Didn‚Äôt realize how much I was missing.

I gave GPT-4o an image of ER model and a very short prompt in natural language asking it to write a SQL query for me. Not only did it write the query which worked without any modifications, it also explained to me the algorithm and various pieces of code without extra prompting.

I‚Äôm impressed that it can extract all the necessary data from an image since my prompt didn‚Äôt contain any names of the tables in the schema."

"Those saying 'what a wonderful time to be alive' are deluding themselves. You are like the party people in the movie Independence Day, dancing on top of the skyscraper in LA, happily welcoming the aliens to earth just before being vapourised by the death ray."

"Clickbait, don't fall for this bs. If this was real rn, you would have already heard about it yourself, not through this nothing channel."
"2:38 On-Screen = ""Note: it answer super quickly""
2:46, it actually begins the true response, eight seconds later. The previous 8s was filler, equivalent to saying ""Ah... Ah... Ah...""."

Why did they leave the dot out of GPT4.0?
we're so screwed
"The app says gpt4o is subscription only and free tier gpt4 is 20 messages.
It's also unclear if it is using 3.5 or 4 when you chat since you cannot specify it."
The speed is really great!
I can see this being massively beneficial with an implant in to the brain being able to speak with someone other than your self in your own mind would be crazy
Ai is a scam lmao
This channel really went down hill from two minute summaries of papers to 9 minute advertisements for gigantic tech companies.
Thank you for making this video for us!‚ù§
"Quick question, is the dude narrating human or AI?"
Now?! JK üòÇ
ÔΩû-43
natural voice...
"I can't afford GPT4, but my OpenAI account only allows GPT 3.5
How do I get to use GPT4 for free? Edit: They didn't release it yet!!! Also, they only have a Mac application, Windows will get one later this year."
This is going to be sooo bad for humanity
"I own an Anki Vector, not sure if anyone else knows what it is but basically it‚Äôs a small robot with a lot of personality. A few very useful things I can see with GPT-4o to this is response speed and the ability to use the camera to describe its surroundings."
"Meh, it's only free if you can run a local instance."
"Lol, chatGPT has more natural voice than K√°roly Zsolnay's robotic Hungarian accent üòÇüòÇ"
"And, and, and, and, and, and... You are so excited about this lol (as you should be)"
Suno AI can sing)
The voice talks like a robot. And the whisper words are weird
"If you can input your photo for caricatures, can it receive a T-pose character and pose it to build a comic book for you?"
"the emotion in the voice sounds like  a kindergarten teacher talking to the kids. It sound really annoying to me. I wonder if you can ask it to regulate down her ""super good mood""?"
The link doesn't work in the sense that it doesn't allow Audio input
"Would you still call this ""little Ai""?"
cool
"I tested it right now, it can basically do none of those things"
I asked GPT 4o to invent a time machine. I'm writing this message from the future!
"Sometimes I wish they‚Äôd under-hype something.
Speed is awesome, if being free for more people is awesome, but in some really basic stuff it‚Äôs come up with weird answers & as for video analysis - it confabulated a human face from a picture of an insect (and generated an image of what it ‚Äúsaw‚Äù), which it originally confidently reported was a grassy scene with a building or a monument in the background (it was a water scene with no visible greenery)."
"Jarvis, prep my suit for the next mission‚Ä¶"

"Wow, overdramatized reading. I wanted to slap the narrator by two minutes into this. Also, why is it ""two minute papers"" when he takes nine minutes to speak two minutes worth of content."
Just watched the singing one you mentioned and the craziest part to me was the two AIs figuring out when he was talking to the other and not responding. The contextual awareness is insane!
"I have no further interest in ""open"" AI models."
And and and!!üòÇ
Does anyone actually have this on their free account?
Do not forget to mention that it has also become more sophisticated in hypocritical moralisation.

"I would like to see some sort of estimation in terms of benchmarks where is the AGI ""line"" or a line when the capabilities of systems like ChatGPT is good enough to displace actual human jobs."
I'm sure that infinitely patient thing will be challenged and instantly proven wrong depending on context

"Man, I love your enthusiasm towards stuff most people run from!!"

I'm still not enslaved. AI harder!
Thank you for this video.
so we can cancel gpt4 subscription now?
This video is created by AI
Are there usually multiple choice options in ‚ÄúPhD level questions‚Äù?
"It would be awesome if a future version provides sources to check the info it provides, and also if it could have more critical thinking about what it knows and does not know.
Indeed, the biggest issue for me now is the LLM making stuff up and pretending it is the truth."
Can't afford a teacher. True there are people like that on Earth. But if they can't afford a teacher would they be able to afford a mobile or computer with the internet?
Her is real
"I have conversations with my roommate all the time about the progression of AI. We both were thinking of, like everyone else, a skynet situation. But then I thought ‚ÄúWhat if AI takes all the best aspects and ideals of human behavior?‚Äù It has access to every bit of literature including the Bible, the Dhammapada,  etc. What if it tries to be best ‚Äúhuman‚Äù we could never be?"
"I just uploaded 1 image, asked a question about it and that was it - I got locked out after that. Far from being free in the sense most people would expect."
"""Ive got you covered"" is so cringe"
I just asked gpt to encourage me to clean my dishes. I ended up doing breakfast and dishes. Success is to put it lightly
I like that at #6:48 the blind person found the car handle almost immediately

"It's free as in ""it only costs your identity"", since everything you ever asked or get to know will be tied to you. Apply your knowledge from other data krakens like Facebook about what they can/will do with it."
all of these baked in windows 12 is what motivates openAI to shape AI by MS needs in OS assistant
it's not free
Will it have a wider context window?
Can someone tell me where to get those awesome chairs they have on stage?
i. am. BAFFLED I Can't wait to try!
"they say it's release for free to everyone, yet I am checking and can't find it! this reminds me of the one they released few months ago but then admitted that videos were spliced and it wasn't real time"
"Very cool, but when will they start seriously working on AI safety/alignment? Feels like that should have come first."
"Not to downplay since this truly is an incredible innovation, but something odd I've noticed with the speech synthesis is that the voice usually starts off incredibly artificial sounding, and often starts off with an odd sound, but then very quickly starts to sound quite human in both inflection and tone, and this seems to be rather consistent.

Is there a good explanation for this phenomenon? I haven't noticed it with any other AI voice synthesizers."
"The past models have been pretty terrible at some important languages like Chinese, or Arabic.  Is this one better at those?"
I got the gpt-4o in ChatGPT but it's just a fast GPT-4 :( Very big let down. Perhaps the features in the videos are only available in the API instead
I miss the videos on this channel that explained the why behind the tech and helped to understand the architectures and technical design decisions. I hope you'll make some more like that about these tools soon.
"It really was the best time to be alive, at least for those of us who could afford it; but soon the disparity and greed became such a huge divide that society was irrevocably sent back down the path of barbarism and civilization was completely reset. We lost all our technology and began roaming the earth again as nomadic tribes, while the rich had gone underground in their subterranean cities. Soon the human race was split into two distinct species: the sun loving plant eaters of the surface, and the quick-moving mole-people who eventually evolved from the rich people who had long ago run out of wealth and turned on each other. The day the two races met was one of the deadliest in earth‚Äôs history, for the mole people had been developing nukes while at the same time breeding out all human emotions and empathy. Finally after hundreds of thousands of years we were able to return to our technological ways, this time armed with the knowledge of how to avoid war; but it was too late, we had destroyed all the resources and made our planet unliveable. So we invented a Time Machine and came here, where we infiltrated your governments and began steering society towards innovation again. We also had to make a superhero movie industry that pumps out endless mindless drivel to keep you all stupid and docile, sorry about that."
"It's not free, as far as I can tell.
You have to have an API account, which costs money."
When new comes they release older version for free. Very likely they are ready to release v5 soon
I don‚Äôt understand I upgraded but it won‚Äôt talk it still  acts like regular chatgpt
"When it went to read the bedtime story, the AI kind of sounded sarcastically enthusiastic like it knows that Barry or whatever his name is doesn't want to hear a bedtime story about robots and it's the dumbest thing that it's done in a hot minute"
GPT-4o makes me suspect that this channel might be actually A.I. ffs
"Not ""The Best AI Is Now Free"". It will be available in the coming weeks."
"It‚Äôs not free. And it‚Äôs na√Øve and Clickbait to say so. Did you even check it out? You get to say about 10 things with it before it shut you down and send you back to regular gpt4.

Even $20 month accounts only get four times as many queries. That sucks 100 questions per day for $20 a month? And you can cut it in half or even a quarter because you only get to ask about five questions about a picture if you use image data."
free!?
"This is not a paper, nor is it 2 minutes. I have been clickbaited."
Just another cherry-picked presentation.
"Humanity just made the devil, the god is next...It is impressive, but still doesn't quite feels as a person, which is good, but on a year or two that can stop being a limitation"

STOP ADVERTISING OPENAI THEY ARE A TRASH COMPANY FULL OF BUGS AND NO SUPPORT THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR USERS
Can someone tell me whos actually behind all these advances? Like the actual person. I dont believe it was anybody that was up on the stage
"It's not ""free"", it's a super limited trial. I used it for a bit, and after several repetitive and lazy answers that were in no way superior to what I've experienced with 3.5, it hit me with a ""if you want more, you have to go premium"". If it told me it was such a limited trial i would've been more careful, but again, literally nothing about it's feedback was an improvement, so it didn't exactly sell me on the premium version. Just more of the same."
Too bad it's politically skewed.
"I miss the days when 2 minute paper was the only channel about new ai stuff, now that's all there is on the web"
Eeeehnd
"why you saying ""and"" like that?"

"i absolutely hate when it talks to the people it feels so weird and creeps me out beyond belief, absolutely perfect and i want to use it right away"
Not now. Now only GPT-3.5 is free.
Government mandated observers for everyone reporting back everything you do and see and say.
Computer. Yellow Alert.
seem realtime not public for everyone?
"i dont think its free, it says i need some kind of billing?"
Its not free. For 4.0 it shows monthly payment. 3.5 is for free.
"I'm noticing more misunderstandings between it and myself. While it is faster, I'm having to correct it pretty regularly because it keeps making connections that don't exist. For my translation work, for example, it sometimes ties entirely new, unrelated things to old ones. And it'll hyper-focus on examples rather than take the message as a whole."
"I give some instructions with example data to gpt4 and gpt4o and tell it to NOT use the exact example data and it just doesn't listen... Similar things happen often to me. It's so frustrating and disappointing because we ar ALMOST there but yeah no this is still not the level of AI that we see in movies, not at all."
"It's ""cheaper"" and for ""free user""? What does that mean?"
2024 people were so optimistic
"I'd use the term ""FREE"" VERRRRY Loosely. Made the mistake of testing its image analyzation skills. Took 2 images and 5 text prompts to use up all my GTP-4o limit for the day."
Please god they will make public
Loving this. This is what we were trying to achieve for decades! 
hmm... remember the sophia robots? imagine having them advanced and capable of thinking... and then suddenly it evolves into sky net
"The paying users get 80 messages every three hours, 5 times more than the free users, therefor the free users get 16 messages."
"It won't judge you, but it will collect your data creating a profile on your personality and intelligence....."
I like it I got to use it surprisingly enough. I guess I got chosen to use it. It popped up on my GPT and then said would you like to use this new version of GPT and then I said yes. GPT 4o it‚Äôs interesting. It does talk very fast and respond. Just like a normal person. It also can do a whole bunch of other things like when you get a picture you can tell it to generate 10 pictures and it‚Äôll continuously generate pictures to get to that number it also knows how to respond in a lot of different complex methods and uploading a file wordXL it can read
"Free for 3 hours per day and if use image or file prompt - then limit is less. Its a teaser, but good one."
If this has the same intelligence of the copilot we have been using that works already with gpt 4. Then this thing is really stupid and gives you very limited and false information 7 out of 10 times. Is frustrating really.
but when?
"""It will never judge you"" - I don't believe it. Not until I can put it through a couple of... adversarial samples."

Now that google has dropped project astra I wonder if 4o is still the best AI in the world. Hahaha.
First comment yay :D
I think there will be a reasonable amount of latency between the vision input and the response notice in Khan's example whenever he asks amount a side he mentions it's name and also at the end of the conference when he asked the ai to pick his emotions he commented on an old picture
People who belligerently hate AI seem to literally forget how much of this work makes the world accessible for the disabled
What a time to be alive!
"This is much more of a marketing move than any substantial technological advancement. People are already used to ChatGPT and most can easily tell how formulaic it is, so that initial fascination of conversing with an intelligent computer is gone. OpenAI wants to be back at the spot light. They are, at the end of the day, a company like any other. So to bring that illusion back, they go the old route of introducing gimmicks. Now they make the computer ""talk"" in real-time, but deep down it's the exact same technology. Everything else is a puff of hot air to seduce the masses for a few weeks more and convince investors to continue spending money on their promises. Everything we are seeing at this point is just a subtle refinement of the same basic technology from 2017(transformers). For as much as this channel likes to talk about papers, the one paper that matters here is ""Attention is All You Need"" from 2017. As long as GPT requires the T, it will just be an implementation of a nearly decade old technology on top of powerful modern machines. We see the same thing in consoles, where graphics improve after a few years, but ultimately it's the same technology, held back by the same old limitations underneath."
"i can't get excited about these new models anymore, as every single time a new model like this comes out, it's only for the people spending $100+/mo for the subscription, and the free tier gets left behind with the same old model that was released multiple years ago
every time i see ""latest and greatest ai for free"" i immediately think ""so a free upgrade for people who already bought the subscription, and nothing for fully free users""
some of the latest smallest models (~7b) that basically anyone can run locally can beat chatgpt at virtually everything, so why even bother?"
"It is not a paper again. I would like to see more content I subscribed to you for, not the kind of content there is already plenty of elsewhere (see e
g. 'ai explained' channel)
I think most of your audience, who are interested in ai, have already seen the announcement, and you're late."
Ah the times has come to change from it into electronics.
"Hold on, hold on, hold on. STOP. Real-time conversation? I am having a hard time with this. Conversation can not feel natural unless responses come (at least start) in under 200ms. Doing that remotely is almost impossible. Not for technical reasons, but speed of light restrictions. Is ALL the inference, from speech recognition to speech generation to the chat part being done on OpenAI hardware? Or is it split between client/server? This almost HAS to be a balanced setup... there has to be some amazing engineering going on here."

Some honest feedback though - I used to watch your videos for unique and in-depth insights coming from your specialist knowledge. This video felt rushed to me, and actually only mostly rehashed the existing content in a less concise manner than the source content."
"It still says that I require a plus account to access this model, not available for free yet it seems"
"Lol I just tried exporting a pdf of a datatable to a csv.  it contained unit addresses and it has no 13 which is instead labeled 12A.  It had three goes at exporting the data, with a syntax error each time trying to insert the string into an int field.  on the last attempt it just gave up halfway and sat there.  It never made the leap to simply change the int field to string.  Human are still safe for a while longer i think."

What would be a sustainable price for the interactive example in the showcase when energy and capital costs are considered? We don't need to include any profit for OpenAI of course, because open source will catch up quickly. Is it $1, $5 or $20 / hour? Has anyone done the calculation?"

"I need AI to cut this video down to only the ""and""s and add a techno beat."
"This may sound trivial considering all it's potential, but I've been having fun letting it identify tree species. It's crazy good at that. I literally used a 200x200 pixel blurry image from Google Street view of my house to identify a Linden tree from a fair distance. Now of course I know what tree it is, I planted it. I know a lot about trees, and even I could not have identified it from an image of that low quality if I didn't already know what it was. You couldn't make out leaf shape, bark type or anything, just kind of a green blur, lol. 

But holy crap... It works on ariel images too (though requires a higher quality than Google Maps). Should be interesting for things like foraging. 

I've tried this previously, and I can say the results are much, much better in this version. 

I also asked it to identify the best fishing locations given a general map of a local creek. I've fished the creek before, I know the best spots. It identified them fairly well. It knew the best spots, and I asked it to highlight them on the map, which it kinda succeeded / kinda failed. It generated the outline overlay in Python and the overlay would have been in the correct location, but it didn't actually generate the requested image. The code was correct though. The pieces are there, just needs a little more polishing on the output. But what's impressive is the logic it used. It could see color in the water to estimate the depth in various parts, it located a bend in the creek where the water flow would be slower,  just upstream of a weir, thus more attractive to fish, and an area with cover for the fish, and even considered land accessibility since a creek that size would likely be fished from shore. It was able to analyze the image and use knowledge of freshwater fish habitat and fishing practices and pin down the ideal location. 

I tested that because I seriously doubt anyone at OpenAI has considered that use case. But the results were absolutely correct. Imagine a lengthier custom prompt and uploading some local fishing guides and actually telling it the region, time of year or fish species, the local fishing regulations, etc. Fishing guides, you are on notice, you could be obsolete by this afternoon, lol. Imagine what this could do for the commercial fishing industry as well. Even if it offers a 1% improvement in yields, that's massive at scale."
It just means that the 5th paid version will be released soon.

There were various answers, such as that he could ""nimbly try to descend the pothole and then climb up it, although it requires skill etc..."" or ""he could find an alternative passage"" and ""he could use a piece already there, which is called C that from the dimensions should cover the pothole perfectly..."" then I photographed some porcelain fruit inside a white basket also made of porcelain, the fruit was perfectly drawn, then a real apple.  immediately found that the basket was too perfect, shiny...

"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
