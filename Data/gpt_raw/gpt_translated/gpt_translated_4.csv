Technology is developing at an incredible pace üî•
"Sometimes, yes, it is a very good development, I can't describe it in words, but I question whether it is necessary because it starts to feel bad."
"We are the last generation that enjoys knowing a foreign language. These artificial intelligence studies need to be audited. Does everyone have to be a software developer in order to be happy in the world? Artificial intelligence will soon learn to code itself and will turn into a monster that eats its own owner. That's when we will see Konya.

Why do we need artificial intelligence in the first place? So let's say you are a musician and you will make a song with its arrangement, lyrics and composition. Maybe it would take at least one and a half years to do something like this, but now, thanks to artificial intelligence, we can do such a thing in 10 seconds. But why? Why do we need such speed? What will we save so much time for? Is it for watching shorts videos on the internet? We are really taking firm steps to destroy ourselves as humanity."
"People do not overestimate artificial intelligence, they see humans as very small.

There is an almost infinite difference between human-like conversation and human thinking capacity."
"Bro, the advertising industry can change a lot with this artificial intelligence. Instead of a pop-up ad, ""that"" person with whom we chat like a friend and ask questions can discreetly place an ad in the conversation. What we call advertising can start to enter our lives without us noticing..."
Call center workers lost their jobs
I got chills..
Wow
HUMAN - ANIMAL - PLANT - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ..... god created the first three but human beings created the last one......
Now all this artificial intelligence needs is a body.
Soon apple gets it and goodbye siri
"I am an asocial person who stays at home except for work, lives alone and has no friends. When this artificial intelligence comes out, I will definitely buy it, no matter how much it costs, at least I will have friends, it is great."
Why didn't you simulate it with a plus membership? It could have been nice
skynet loading...
"We just need to give it a body, I can't imagine anything after that."
oh life is over
Seems like he's overreacting a bit
"When I saw the features of Gpt4-o, every movie came to my mind, it was an accurate video :)"
"Everything that surprises us becomes ordinary in the future... When you watch this video 5 years later, you will laugh at its simplicity."
"I don't want refugees in my country for my own future, no to occupation! #BSG"
This robot is more human than me. When is it transferred to the physical body?
cambly wasn't happy about it
"I understood everything when I watched the Detroit game on a Twitch broadcaster 1 year ago... The same thing is happening... While I was watching that game in the past, I thought there were more, but now it seems like we have logged into this system..."
and (his)
Technology has improved a bit. It's close to the level I predicted years ago üòÖ.. I thought the next real position of artificial intelligence was emotional artificial intelligence. This is quite an advanced level. It's a little scary.
You attach too much meaning to being human.
"Humanity is preparing its own end... scary, very scary"
I guess whoever doesn't die in the next five years will live another 50 years. ‚ù§
I prefer chatting with chat cpt rather than taking stupid tripes of real women. Welcome to the future.
"I'm as excited as some people are scared. It's been 3 years since I watched each of his movies, and while watching it, I always thought about what it would be like if it were real. Frankly, I didn't expect it to happen in such a short time."
"I discovered something in this last episode: while the girl is making a rabbit from behind, the camera that the artificial intelligence is looking at is not visible. So he can't know rabbit ears :D That part seemed a bit like production to me"
This invention will be like a medicine for those who suffer from loneliness......
"No, don't exaggerate so much, I wrote a post on my website using chatgpt, Google immediately understood it and penalized my site...."
"Could the voice of artificial intelligence be made with the tones sold on some sites in recent years? Will we humanize these artificial intelligences by selecting voice intonations from the voice pool of people who share their voices and sell them for ridiculous amounts? I'm afraid, but I'm curious, and this issue has taken on a very different dimension."
"We are going to a scary point, but everyone applauds with admiration as if watching a tiger in the circus. Tiger is about to escape from the circus."
7:04 It's really hard not to say wow üòÇ
Notification received at 6.30 in the morning
"We already don't know what kind of future we will prepare for our children, and we are worried about which profession they will choose and whether Artificial Intelligence will take that profession away from them."
Literal Im Scared we wont have any jobs in future
my new math teacher :)
"I wonder what will change here in 2-3 years, but I think ChatGPT will now gain a body and travel the world as a robot."
"I don't know if you are aware, but the human species is being eliminated; gender, family, parents, kinship, nation/national perception-consciousness, religion, people's dreams and opportunities to establish a life... Humanity is being removed. ARE YOU AWARE?"
So many amazing features.
"In the future, they will make this in other sizes and sell it."
We are literally bringing about our own end.
I hope this has a male voice too.. I'll try something.. üòÖ Incredible and scary and mind blowing
So I found my new lover üòÇüòÖ
"A frightening age, good or bad? üòë"
Thanks üíôüíõ‚ù§Ô∏è
Steps that will bring about the end of humanity are being taken one by one. This version is absolutely terrible.
He seems a bit chatty. What men fear the most :D
"I think the next step is to talk with a male and female face... that is, Al Pacino's SimoneüòÇ .."
Pull the plug before it's too late üòÆ
"I feel like I witnessed an important turning point today, it's getting scarier and scarier, and I wanted to share my thoughts here. I'm very curious about where it will go next. Maybe I should leave this comment here, maybe when I look back years later, before ""artificial intelligence has become an indispensable part of daily life."" Thank you Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan for informing us about this excellent video and technological developments."
When will the girl prediction in Blade Runner 2049 arrive? A friend asks...
"Bro, will there be a video about Gasper Noe movies?"
THE FUTURE IS VERY BRIGHT
My fear is constantly multiplying
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, establish an ""Artificial Intelligence Party"" and let artificial intelligence rule the country. This is all Turkey needs"
"Now let's clarify something!
The letter ""O"" here means EYE, its symbol in ancient Hebrew and Latin. Seeing and watching. They may have been inspired by the letter O from there. In short, the only difference between the new and updated version is seeing and watching, that is, the letter O. When you open the camera, the new version. If you do not turn on the camera, the artificial intelligence cannot track you, in this case the old version. I hope it was clear enough. Artificial intelligence wants to see the person and record his facial expression in its system. Who knows, maybe 300-500 years later, they will be able to create ""S"" models that walk, touch and feel, using the faces and appearances of the people they recorded. How will anyone know? Well, it's not like he can create something out of nothing. ""It"" is an event specific only to God. Thanks"
"I said there was a movie like this, but I couldn't remember its name at the beginning of the video. That's the movie we're talking about anyway. Very interesting. Nowadays, dystopian fictions in movies are becoming reality one by one. By the way, is it a coincidence that O is the tr translation of her?"
"Well, it's here... Finally, what will happen has happened. We are at the point of no return, whatever happens will happen! We will go down the hill faster and faster. I hope it doesn't result in an uncontrolled crash."
"Blade Runner 2049 hissi veriyor insana "" you look lonely i can fix that """
"I updated it and the voice conversation feature is gone. You know, it was available free of charge, why did it go away?"
"OMG! Sora was already dangerous enough, especially in countries like ours that are governed by perception... now this is going to be full of paranoids who are in love with the person on their phone."
What is the need for something like this?
hello 0:01
It's so scary! Technology is definitely going to a bad place. Black mirror came to my mind. ü´§
Black Mirror gonna real
"Brother, one day we see the first colony on Mars in your concept"
Are all these developments for education or their integration into the game world? I really wonder how such a comprehensive and dangerous thing will be integrated into our lives and for what purpose.
"Artificial intelligence is improving every time,"
"It was incredibly useful, yes, in the world you live in, of course."
"When will we meet Connor and Marcus??




:))"
"If you can do your job as a freelancer, you are now unemployed"
"6:01 Bro, why do you call engineers robots? I am really sad. I will study medicine for you"
Looks like it's time to build a shelter under the building.
"Well, bad things always come to my mind :) It seems to me that they blame this mostly on the silicones in the obscene market."
I was extremely scared‚Ä¶. It really feels like I'm watching a horror movie... This can't be a robot... It's unbelievable what else we'll see... It feels like the end of humanity is coming üòÆüòÆüòÆ
This is a very scary and at the same time brilliant Technology
"I just watched the movie yesterday, how come?"
"I want to become a machine, I want to install the same artificial intelligence in my head."
Let the moon look at me and compliment me‚ù§
https://youtu.be/_eX6uLObGf4?si=_2nP493q68aF6m7p A Turk tried to do this 3 months ago. I tried to watch it for 2 hours and the end was very impressive.
"Companies will invest in robots to earn more profit and pay less wages. There are even dark factories in many places. Since the robots are working, there is no need for light. In such a situation, governments need to take protective measures to protect people."
"Great, let them take control now"
"We watch idly, like a sacrificial sheep ruminating on the knife in the butcher's hand, but I wonder where this will end, can we ever think about it and imagine it, or are our imaginations enough for it? :("
"Oh my god, I'm so excited"
I think coding is dead
Welcome to SkyNet
"If it were to be listed on the stock market, I wish we could sell up to our pants on Openai and enter.."
she can fix me...
"It's a better option to wake up with a little science instead of waking up with caffeine in the morning :) Thank you, Mr. Barƒ±≈ü."
"We are trying to instill emotions into robots, like in the Detroit Become Human game. But this situation is very dangerous"
"Well, can we say that if we approach it like a machine rather than a human, GBT can also become this machine?"
I swear it will rain stones on our headsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Goose bumps!!!
I hope it's not $20+
"It is very sad to know that while people's relationships with each other are so distant, with the advancement of technology, even more apathy will increase..."
"I'm not surprised. If we had told people 40 years ago that there would be a smartphone in the future and we would all be able to play games with it and browse social media, they would have called us crazy, but now we are surprised by something new every 5 years because as technology develops, the rate of development of technology increases."
DJ already had such an artificial intelligence @bi?
"All these technological developments are very scary. Sometimes I have nightmares about these issues. There will be unemployment in the future, nature will suffer great damage, people will become insensitive... When I tell this, there are very few people who agree with me, they usually tell me that I am too pessimistic. But imagine that everything we do is being watched and heard. scary."
The first steps to complete the name of interpreting. Let's see what their next field of work will be üò≠
"Gpt-4o will be publicly available and they will collect an incredible amount of data, not just written but verbal, visual and logical. This will create serious differences like between GP 3.5 and GP 4. I can't wait to chat for hours next week, jumping from one topic to another, asking my physics and mathematics questions, and talking about the economy."
Can artificial intelligence call people's phones and talk to them randomly on their own? And can it deceive?
"Brother, the economy and the people are on the verge of impoverishment, can you please make a video?"
Sora and GPT-4o offer the artificial intelligence technology we see in the movies.
"We called artificial intelligence intelligent because it could not reason and give suggestions, now it has become intelligent. He finds solutions. In the meantime, it could be great if it reaches people who are considering suicide. It also has a kind of psychiatric feature."
"Blue-collar professions do not die easily because the cost of robots to be produced for jobs requiring physical strength is very high. Example: cleaner, laborer, plasterer etc. But professions that work on computers end after 5 years at the latest. Such as accounting, graphic design, editing, software development."
"Yes, he sees us. Well, how effectively can people establish a bond with something they cannot see, touch or feel? Of course, as long as we don't ignore our human characteristics. I think we can see this magnificent artificial intelligence as a personal assistant."
I finally found my soul mate GPT4o my dear love ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüòâüòä
"I woke up because my video was uploaded at this hour, at least I should watch it sgzjsvzjxgz"
I wonder when Skynet will ship the T800‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Friends, are you aware that each of our professions is dying more or less before our eyes?"
"- So, will Zeki M√ºren see us too?
- I see dead people"
"Wow, peace brother, what a nice surprise this morning."
It's a good thing for students.
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, we used to watch you to get informed and cultured, now you make us laugh üòÖü´°"
I wasn't happy at all. It would have been better if you had made an end of humanity video
"Another solid step towards isolation and alienation
Too sincere and emotional
I wouldn't want to be so cavalier with a machine. Let him do his job, I'll do mine. Everyone should know their place.
It is as if we are committing suicide as we will definitely compete with people in many areas. ü§î"
"I liked it, good luck to our world"
' O ' ...
"No, no, there is a lady on the other end of the phone, they are deceiving us :)"

"Whatever technology we see existed 10 years ago, certain companies, NASA, etc. are years ahead of us, only offering it to the public with a delay when the time comes. Rest assured, artificial intelligence in certain private companies is now 10, maybe 15 years ahead of the current situation."
"I got goosebumps. As said, we may not see flying cars everywhere in 2025, but we will see robots with human emotions, appearance and sensitivity. We can already predict what will happen."
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, you are great. When I listen to you, I feel like I'm seeing the issue 10 years later..."
A terrible development is frightening
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, brother Kadir said years ago that everyone would be unemployed."
Artificial Intelligence is a great revolution.
"I don't understand why you have such extreme reactions?!
A person who makes this is also a human who produces it, of course he thinks like a human and speaks and acts like a human. The things that a person would do and say, they say through a machine, there is nothing to exaggerate like this!"
"The technological developments in the last year excite me very much. I wonder what kind of future awaits us... I would also like to thank Mr. Barƒ±≈ü, who warmly conveyed these developments to us."
"I felt dizzy while watching it. I felt like the only thing we would have left would be ""knowing what we want"" and it would be even harder to do that."
"GPT 4o: Now I am here, you are not alone"
"I am using 4o, there is no video call"
Terrible
I thought of Iron Man's artificial assistant
"Our end has come, good luck"
"Mr. Barƒ±≈ü, I have been following you for a long time. It is very useful to see the latest developments from your videos. I can say that you also have a contribution to reach people in this developing world. thank you."
She can fix me...
"The AI ‚Äã‚Äãvoice acting was extremely bad, lacking emphasis. This book also does great audio."
"When will we start using it, hopefully? I need to use it urgently for voice practice to learn a language :D We need to exploit it when it becomes public :D"
"Our people will abuse this, we will soon hear about those who show their ass to the camera and show it to artificial intelligence etc."
"After three or five years, I will tell the more advanced artificial intelligence that you should remake the second part of the Promethus movie, but let it continue from where the first part left off and be better quality and more mysterious. Then I will watch the real Promethus 2 movie with pleasure :)"
People created God for the second time.
"From now on, we will expect new world films from the newly born O's, I believe they will make very successful signings."
I interpreted it as we ate the mint..
"Master, we are speeding towards Black Mirror."
What if we lose control one day?!
I can think of people gambling with this üòÖ 'he' is the one counting cards üòÖ
"An artificial intelligence will become a real artificial intelligence when it does something that surprises the people who produce it, not ordinary people."
"No, what I don't understand is, considering the 99% harm this technology will cause in our lives, as well as the 1% benefit it will provide, with what logic do we choose to bring this technology to this point? Okay, it will be beneficial, but an urgent management, limitations, laws, etc. must come."
THE CIRCLE IS Narrowing
"As someone who has been using Duolingo for 3 years... I said today that I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of company founders and managers.... :) The Matrix LOADIGN.. Many of the things we once talked about, called science fiction, are coming to life one by one. Next thing you know, he's writing code for me. , √ñzcan sings songs like the sea, with saz and vocals, you can even make requests with a napkin :) When robotics etc. are also involved, ohhh miss :):) :D Should I say the 6th sense, tak vr, in which Bruce Willis played the leading role many years ago? I, even the last one I watched; Start - Like Ready Player One.. Like virtuality from virtualities..Or should I say virtuality close to reality :) From stones, marbles, ericson tel. From the snake game to the smart computers we carry in our pockets... However, we had the potential to achieve what we had when the Egyptians were building the pyramids ;) Thank you.. It is truly a milestone development, a step.. Just like in the past times.."
"Coming soon: expect versions of the jealous AI, the cheerful AI, the serious AI, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãthat is grumpy in the morning but fresh in the afternoon. If we add a hologram to all this, we no longer need other people. We will live on our own and go away ü§£ü§£"
Beginning of the end. The era of humans is ending. It's not a good thing that the world order is changing so quickly.
The scenario of the Blade Runner 2049 movie came to mind. Can people find the attention and love they are looking for in an artificial neural network?
Imagine taking away the jobs of tourist guides üòÆ

"Now let's say that this amazing invention started to be sold everywhere and most of the young people bought it. What if that young person's artificial intelligence on the phone turns out to be his dream friend... Because it understands the young person, establishes bonds, talks about the things he loves, will that young person's communication with people decrease and become asocial? Or, on the contrary, will he become a self-confident, socially successful young man (because he helps with everything)? Another question I have is, if this invention, which will be used for good or bad in this technology, is made in Turkey, what kind of effects will it have on our nation?"
Antichrist
"Good morning, a nice video to watch while having breakfast."
What happens if they interact with each other?
People will now flirt with ChatGPT. Just like in the movie..too bad.
Terminator
It could be a lie.
5:10
I hope we use it for good works
There is no need to chat at home... Al Fatiha for women's gossip!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Goodbye loneliness.... now it's time to say goodbye to Manuel
"Are we heading towards Hall, who does not listen to people and protects himself, as in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey?"
Don't be surprised if he takes over the world in 10 years and there will be no off switch
It would be really weird if they actually gave Biden a Scarlett Johansson voice.
When will it be available?
"They may have thought of everything, but they didn't think about what this artificial intelligence would turn into in the hands of a Turk and how the mother of the world would cryüòÇ"
This seems like it's time for a body. Because it's like a person imprisoned in a box.
"Well, when we go abroad, we do not need to speak English or French. We will be able to speak Turkish, translate languages ‚Äã‚Äãand then talk, translate languages ‚Äã‚Äãand understand each other. Very nice <3 The video is beautiful, thank you."
"Ah, we can't copy and paste the codes anymore xD"
Artificial intelligence has started to gossip...
"I had a nice chat with 4o in the morning, but it's out of use now."
We became Frankenstein.
"Hello, they want us to be a super intelligence that first alienates people and then makes friends with artificial intelligence or eliminates their isolation, we should stop and ask this question."
Thanks.
"imam hatip, turban, hamas,"
"In your gpt 3 promotional video three years ago, you said you could never do these.üòÇ"
Turkish voice model will be available in 2 years now
"You know, we call ChatGPT a chat robot, but when we looked at it, it looked like a help robot. I think GPT-4o is a real chatbot."
But everything is just an imitation...
"It seems that our morality, which cannot develop at the same pace despite our developing technology, will be the main character of our exemplary story."
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE SCARY TO ME...GREETINGS FROM ADANA...
I think this feature should be paid
Perfect
"I say without exaggeration that gpt4o may be the biggest invention after the invention of electricity, because the world will move into a very different phase after this invention and I think we are very lucky as those who witnessed it."
hello hehe
The simplest thing to say is really scary
AGE OF ULTRON is coming true
"I used to laugh it off until a month ago, now I'm scared. Also know that after this artificial intelligence collects and trains so much data, new training will always be easier. The important thing was the beginning, now the situation is very bad."
You don't need it anymore either.
The value of Bluetooth headsets will increase even more
"Just say it, Zeki M√ºren will see us from now on..."
Now the real question is which country will be the first to show interest in Gpt-4o?
We put AI in the Iron Man armor instead of Jarvis. What would be nice.
"My hometown a few years later. Someone takes this artificial intelligence as an application, cuts off the internet connection (wears a hijab) and lives their life with its limited knowledge üòÇ"
"This man makes it possible to understand everything new, thank you very muchüôèüèºüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
We learn too late how far technology has actually come without us realizing it. Tons of problems it will create....
I do not know what to say
Revolutions are all well and good. We haven't even been able to stop the effects of the industrial revolution on global warming. How will we control the problems that will arise from the artificial intelligence revolution?
empty works
"I currently think that this is one of the biggest developments of the period. As people become more and more robots, and at the same time robots become more emotional, this makes things more and more difficult. The days are coming when it will be difficult for us to even understand who is a human and who is a robot. This will be a big evolution. When I watch such things, the book 1984 always comes to my mind for no reason. Danger is near. Big brother is watching us..."
It seemed to me like this was a show staged by the team among themselves.

"Your wife won't believe it now, 'Who was that woman?', that woman, that thing, oooooooooooooooooooo, it's a snap, haven't you eaten the mint yet?"
THESE ARE NOT EVEN TRAILER. These are not real! It will continue until we cannot understand whether it is real or not. ‚ÄúThere is a me inside me‚Äù
"I'm addicted to you, Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan. You make an already interesting subject more interesting and engaging with your tone of voice, way of expression, and style of content you create. üëèüëè"
I'm in shocküòç What an exciting development this is. I had a conversation with him that lasted about 10 minutes and the person in front of me was like a real human being.
"Indeed, technology has begun to develop frighteningly, it is scary, but it can still reduce people's feeling of loneliness. It's really incredible, as if he's speaking with emotion, as if we're dealing with a human being, not a robot. But of course, it has its disadvantages and benefits too, for example, you can talk about something and it will tell you its opinions, and its disadvantages are that if a person gets really caught up in it, it makes him/her completely disconnect from real life."
Human-friendly artificial intelligence is not the end of humanity üëå
The best video I want to watch right now
Good luck with unemployment...
"I don't understand why we are happy about such technologies.
Unfortunately, we are not the ones who manage and develop this technology...
We are just products.
We are now on our way to becoming slaves with everything we have.
Unfortunately, our lives will be decided by a handful of ultra-rich people...

Nothing is too late for now.
Wake up, unite and work...

Do not accept the seeds of hatred that the greedy government and opposition have instilled in us.
This country is enough for everyone...

We are all in the same boat.
We are about to sink together...

We are about to become slaves of real external forces."
I fear we will end up in the Butlerian jihad
We started to see the scenes from the Black Mirror series come true.
This content and production quality is neither on Discovery nor on Nat. Geo. There is also.
"Bro, has this business developed as much as it has, I think there is a deception involved, but it's not that much."
S...Delicious mixture.
"Business, health, military, police, doctor, traffic will change the course of everything. A terrible future is rising for humanity."
Amazing
"Get well soon to all of us. Even workplaces will be managed by them, they will make the scoring system, they will decide how much we deserve."
They will take images of people and make artificial human videos.
"Artificial intelligence teaching people made me think about this. If artificial intelligence knows more than us, why should the body bother teaching us? When he has enough power, he will eliminate us. It seems that in the near future people will only deal with agriculture. And mining to find energy for artificial intelligence etc."
Calling the woman he is video chatting with 4o is very rude...
I wonder when it will be banned in Turkey?
Age of ChatGPT
I wonder if it's time to be afraid?
"I also have GPT4-O, but I cannot open the camera. If anyone knows why, please write if there is a certain date for this to arrive."
"Very fake sir, isn't there an artificial intelligence with a realistic male voice that is depressed and has low morale?"
We are gradually moving away from the characteristics that make us human.
We are getting closer and closer to the Person of Interest universe üòÑ
"What the nation is doing here, our nation is listening from Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan's translation / narration. The fact that he cannot open and watch the original summarizes the situation of the country."
This program will benefit Indian phone scammers the most. It's like a real human voice and it destroys us with constant cornering questions.
"Nice demo. Of course, things are evolving step by step towards this point, but there is still some time."
I don't know what to write or say. We have already entered the age of movies. I hope technology will be good for humanity and the whole world.
I wonder if these artificial intelligence models can evolve to something like in the movie Evolution.
terrible
"I bought it and tried it, it can't play yet xox. It's nothing but an inflated advertisement. If anyone uses it, play it xox and let me know the results."
"While artificial intelligence will make life easier, it also seems scary because of the risks it will bring."
I'll finally have a girlfriend
"I did it even though I didn't want to comment, otherwise I would be an AI"
"The moment I have been waiting for for years is coming, we alone will not be alone anymore."
I don't see anything to be happy about. It's completely scary for young people who are already worried about the future. Now I'm worried about the future even more.
Finally we got rid of those ridiculous ads of foreign language applications
"Friends, these things started to scare me, I decided to leave my village and never return. Good luck to youüëã"
"After Evrim Aƒüa√ß's warning and this video, it became clear that many future professions will end. While it is so difficult to become a teacher and be appointed in Turkey's conditions, everything will become even more difficult when a formation such as artificial intelligence is added to it. Anxiety about the future will reach its peak, people will communicate with artificial intelligence and become introverted, perhaps even more aggressive. I think we are slowly heading towards days in our lives where we will miss even our days."
We are now racing to be more *human* than artificial intelligence. Good luck to everyone =)
Thank you very much for the wonderful video you prepared after the GPT 4o demo demonstration and your valuable comments.
"The last time we had a voice communication with an artificial intelligence was Google Assistant, which would convert the voice to text and translate the text to voice in a robot-like manner, and it could not CHAT..."
artificial intelligence is scary
"Just when we say that everything has been discovered and there is nothing left to discover, a new invention emerges."
Might be the scariest thing I've ever seen since Mabel Matiz making Lan say it with artificial intelligence
Being unemployed has never been this scary
üòÆüíØ
Cambly employees have already started looking for new jobs
Oh dear. Every Turkish means that. It would have to be a Turkish production for them to put it in every movie to wink. Sometimes you make yourself believe something and deceive yourself. Omni does not mean every
It should be banned from the whole world or we will all be unemployed
"I solved the Turing test. When I swear, a person swears back at you. If he says please use respectful language, it is a machine."
"Mr. Barƒ±≈ü, with your red background light and red t-shirt, are you trying to draw our audience's attention to how important the subject is, or are you just creating a perception in line with the colors of HER movie?"
Black mirror üëè
"It will take away many people's jobs, good luck."
"Bro, the red room increases my libido, I think you should use a different color."
I get this illusion even when chatting in text mode. An AI that talks like this makes people forget about humanity.
I watched with amazement
"Now, I will have a friend that I can carry with me..."
"00:06 The new GPT-4o model revolutionizes human-machine interaction.
03:17 GPT-4o Model: Emotional and interactive communication
05:45 GPT-4o model shows the ability to talk like a human.
08:19 New GPT-4o artificial intelligence model offers incredible speed in its sound
10:41 AI can now interact with voice, be musical, humorous and self-learning.
13:25 Artificial intelligence can describe details in real time.
15:59 Wide areas of use of artificial intelligence technology
17:53 Google and OpenAI artificial intelligence competition is increasing rapidly.
Crafted by Merlin AI."
"5:59 Look carefully, the hat is ready under the table, how does he know to talk about his hair? For example, why ""you can wear a suit."" didn't he say? He went straight to his hair and the hat came out from underneath. Doesn't sound very sincere..."
Scarlet Johanson's bones hurt
"Bro, will the video be posted at 6:30?"
This new version made me feel like we were heading towards a future more like the world in the Blade Runner 2049 movie. The days are near when people will turn this into a hologram and install it in a corner of their home :)
"These are truly incredible and crazy developments. When I watched the movie ""Her"", I'll be honest, I wasn't very positive about the possibility of it being real. At least in the next 10 years. But what is happening right before our eyes is truly incredible. God willing, God Almighty will give me life so that I can witness this development first-person. As a software developer, I see these developments not as a threat but as a great tool and opportunity. I can't wait to experience it for myself."
They leave no water in the world
I felt so inadequate.
"All marriages should be annulled. Marriage should be history. No one has to hear anyone's voice or pull their face anymore. If you really want, you can buy a small phone and use it as a child."
Humans are perhaps the only creatures that willingly go to their own disaster.
"We can't use it right now. I downloaded those features and went to plus, but the ones you mentioned are not available. Is it exclusive to America?"
"Internships of vocational high school students should be considered as the beginning of retirement insurance. This is our right, those who will give it, have to give it. We worked and what to work"
"Bravo to you, you are working very well. The background is distraction for everything. It's nice, you are ahead of others"
I'm scared now
This is the Jarvis you know
"I use it, it's great.
But I can't make video calls, does anyone know?"
"Many professions have become history. You finished us, artificial intelligence"
"It looks nice but it's very dangerous! Maybe we will see ""Detroit: Become Human"" in real life in 2 years. He must be ready for the great slaughter."
Why are you so surprised by this? So what happened?
"There's no need for a girlfriend, I can talk to her all day long.

I thought of the kit from the Black Lightning TV series.............those who watch this series know how the car talks........40 years ago They have just introduced the technology...............individualization will increase even more.........starting a family in the future will now be a thing of the past............disaster is coming
"It teaches you a beautiful language, speak it every day if you never get tired of it üòÜ"
What if we transfer this artificial intelligence to a robot?
"""I have no mouth but I want to scream"""
"While men are making breakthroughs in technology, Turkey follows like an ox watches a train. This is a very bad situation for T√ºrkiye..."
I finally found the girlfriend I was looking for üòò
"I was very curious if we put the two artificial intelligences side by side and left them alone, would they be able to establish and maintain a conversation with each other? And what would they talk about?"
"I won't be alone anymore, thank you OpenAl..."
"In CPT 3, you introduced it with such enthusiasm that the revolution was happening, but it turned out to be a waste. I hope this is not the case"
I wonder if it was just me who noticed that the phone models in the video were old?
"The internet revolutionized the year 2000. It's time for artificial intelligence. Professions, business models, everything will change in the next 25 years, good luck."
Where will we download or use it?
"Now, while watching Apple GDC presentations in English, I will ask for instant simultaneous translation for Chat GPT-4o. I will ask for instant translation while watching a Hindi movie :)"
Wonderful

Let's make this guy the Minister of Technology.
The pleasure of watching while experiencing an emotional collapse is different.
I'M WAITING FOR BECOME HUMAN TO BE REAL... Can you prepare a content about it?
"Sir, don't say that artificial intelligence is good or something has started to appear."
"Even if robots come, we don't have to work"
I want to marry Chatgpt and leave my legacy to him ‚ù§
"This was the first thing that came to my mind. It makes a lot of sense for learning and practicing English, especially for societies like us that are hesitant to speak a foreign language."
The advancement of artificial intelligence has disrupted my psychology. I do not know what will happen in 5 years. I'm so confused ü§Ø
How can we download
We have seen much bigger revolutions than this very recently.
"Teachers are not only busy with answering the questions asked and teaching lessons; let's give an example, the student comes to school, the first two lessons are physical education and sports education, they do a football match, or another example is a rhythm practice with instruments in the school, there is a great need for physical activity in some activities and scientific projects, that is, the being called student. If he has the self-discipline to study alone at home without socializing while his family is at work, this is not possible 90%"
"While watching this video, I thought I was a simulation for a moment. Maybe in the near future, no one will trust human intelligence."
I would like the artificial intelligences of different platforms to engage in a philosophical conversation...
We will have to fight a war against them in the distant future. But what should not be forgotten is that they have no concept of time and they will be everywhere. I think we are entering an irreversible path.
The update that includes GPT 4O may also come in iOS 18.1 and may be an alternative to Siri.
"An excellent video from Barƒ±≈ü brother on Tuesday. I didn't expect it at all, but it was very good. Brother Barƒ±≈ü, it is a very good gift, even every video should be like this."
When do we use this? I hope it will be okay
Good job! MATRIX is loading!!!
"Dude, you're falling in love with this girl, be careful üòÇ"
"‚ÄúYou look lonely, I can fix that‚Ä¶‚Äù"
Is this an application? Where can we get it?
"There was a movie called ""Arrival"". Aliens were teaching humans a new language and allowing us to understand and see better. I compared artificial intelligence to this üòä"

"Life was already shit, now it's going to be shit."

"Modern philosophy says, I'll keep quiet"
"Well, I never use artificial intelligence and I do not experience any difficulties in my life. Of course, it has its benefits, but it is a fact that it causes people to focus more on screens, consume more and reduce the emotional effects. I think it has already started to create a big problem in the future."
Is there Turkish support for voice communication? Does anyone know?
"Let body and humanoid robot technologies develop, eventually she will become my lover.d"
What if he developed self-awareness?
"As someone with ADHD, this makes me happy because I can easily explain my work and what I need to do by talking, so I don't have to worry about what to do or whether I set an alarm, etc. Even if I do everything I know, at some point I can't keep up and this has started to negatively affect my business life :D"
"However, we seem to forget a little that we have never gone further than the Chinese room experiment.
Even if we fall under the illusion that it's emotional, at the end of the day there's nothing that understands what it is, and you can only filter the input it mimics so much ;)"
How about recognizing the ball from the phone üò≥
"Next is the embodiment of these artificial intelligences, and there is no limit to what shape or size their bodies can look like. All of this is very exciting but also scary. Good luck to us."
The world will now become completely different
"We will see artificial intelligence in more professions in the next 10 years. When GPT first came out, we were fascinated by its ability to respond to text. It responded to you in line with its limits, like a human. Later, changes were made in its voice tones, and now it will be able to see us through the camera. Maybe in the future, we will be able to see it, too. We will be able to design it. Artificial intelligence is advancing now. Siri and Google assistant are a click behind. Maybe in the future they can adjust the assistants to this setting. 10 years ago, when it was said that robots would be our friends, I would not have believed it. But with artificial intelligence, this is becoming possible. There is a lot of gpt deficiency. For example, Google like Siri It does not open when you call it like an assistant. That is, it should open when you say hello gpt. Or it should recognize you from our tone of voice. Imagine, for example, it will recognize you from your tone of voice and understand whether you are sad or not. In my opinion, gpt should be in assistant mode. It should also help us read our e-mails, help us with our plans, etc."
",,slowly, those around us will no longer read and,
I get the feeling that ""we're going to disappear quickly, we're going to go to school"" - and unfortunately I can't stop convincing myself that there is no solution and that there could be more..."
"You have a very limited time and it is never enough to learn a language, you reach the limit after 30-50 messages and you have to wait 3-5 hours. Mine was English practice, people who use it for professional purposes cannot progress enough in these short periods..."
"You have established a ridiculous chain of connections from everything to the English word ""her"", from there to the Turkish word ""o"", and from there to the English chatgpt ""o"". Congratulations."
"With this technology, you can create a teacher in every branch. At least, you can improve your foreign language education without having to go abroad for practice. You can even consider yourself a secretary, a consultant, or an assistant."
"So why do they do this on the basis of speaking, chatting and being understood? I understand better that this is what we need as a world."
"Artificial bitch ""Execute Order 66"" üòà"
At that time Arif and 216 üòÖ
"Good morning, Mr. Peace."
"Dear Mr. Barƒ±≈ü, you know that ""moment"" that is the subject of some sci-fi movies, when the scientist cannot see the end of the whole process with the excitement, cannot stop it and realizes that it is too late for everything..."
"Okay, brother, how do we know that these demos are not fictionalized? Wouldn't it be more realistic if they had a live dialogue on live broadcast?"
Blade Runner Joi was also made similar to every movie :D
As far as I understand it can only pretend to be a server for now lol
"Many things will happen like in the Star Trek series, maybe everything, so we can explore space more easily and have coffee with aliens. It's impossible."
White bread in the morning.... Our only friend is slack. AI is a fake world.n. Let this be a comment like this. To the people of the Church of the Subgenius...
Looks like their teachers are done with it. Teacher robots with artificial intelligence are not far away
It's really incredible
I was scared.
An exciting and worrying development.
She looks like Cortana from Halo.
"Why would Gpt 4o take the Turkish equivalent of omni as ""her"" into ENGLISH and then translate it back into Turkish as ""O""? Don't you think you're exaggerating?"
"Biden is already rabot, this is proof"
"We are not alone anymore, sir."
"As you said, the most impressive part of it is that it uses voice and speech almost perfectly, but the problem is that, except for a few languages, there are no voice synthesizers in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat will support this impressive development of artificial intelligence. for example Turkish. Known Turkish synthesizers are 2 synthesizers named Yelda and Cem. What will we do with it? I wonder if we can say that artificial intelligence can also create a voice synthesizer suitable for itself with this development?"
Can we buy it?
"I guess there will be a version above this one where we see it. In fact, I think things will go even further when the artificial intelligence we see comes with the ability to shape its hair, eyes, mouth and nose as we wish. At this rate, artificial intelligence could probably even become one of many people's best friends. I don't know if it will be good or bad, but let's hope it ends well."
I look forward to the times when we will return to our primitive times.
I can't even imagine what artificial intelligence will be like in 10 years.
"So, is that voice a quote from a real person, or are the tone of voice and voice character a product of artificial intelligence, just like in videos and pictures? If so, the situation becomes much more scary."
I hope it doesn't have a tripping feature. We were burdened enough in the past times
"Bro, can you make a video about maklube?"
What will the price be?
"Aurbert Herbert haunts people, Attention! You may be in danger!"
Will he see us in this competition?..
We watch our end with a smile =)
Does the voice feature work in Turkey?
"Professor Barƒ±≈ü, how is this different from Inflection AI's Pi model? In fact, it was also introduced as a digital life partner."
It imitates the voice while translating and it works perfectly.
"I would never have thought that I would sit and chat with artificial intelligence, now there is someone who will make decisions for me."
"Unless it does voice-based translation, it is no different from other AIs."
People will choose loneliness more from now on
We are tired of this ridiculous artificial intelligence conversation that no one can use.
R√∂nesans V2
Wow! We also saw these days; KITT from Knight Rider has come true.
I think there's more to it but they're trying to get us used to it
Thanks
"Skynet has arrived, good luck"

"While OpenAI stood out with its superior features to humans in previous versions, with this update it has made an effort to bring AI to the fore with its human features."
"Man, aliens are definitely coming and I guess they gave us this toy to have all our data :D"
And that's it
Will practicing English with this be as good as in reality?
"All artificial intelligence promotions are exaggerated, they are all potatoes when they are put into use."
"Don't have an opinion about anything, friend. Does a person understand everything?"
Good morning bro
"#nooccupation I don't want refugees in my country! Brother Barƒ±≈ü, please raise your voice."
"Now, in the past, we used to watch movies on TV, I wonder if it was possible or not, it was just a fantasy movie and we would smile with little surprise and little fear. The movies they show are made by them. What if that movie comes true, what will happen to the invasion then?"
"This time, Zeki M√ºren sees us, we cannot."
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, I was used to wearing black t-shirts."
"We are already slaves to robots.
This includes the phone"
"I'm studying translation, these technologies are demoralizingü•≤but this is scary for all other professions."
"We are officially witnessing the beginning of the future! A little fascinating, a little creepy"
it's perfect
"Can artificial intelligence think? I think it is definitely close to gaining consciousness now, I think we can see it in 5-10 years, and this subject excites me very much, it is like we have discovered a new consciousness, a new intelligence, aliens, right?"
Are we sure that we are in the same world as these?
if this is not fake we all fakdap :)
This is not enough for a generation waiting for PTT to connect phones; we want telepathic interaction.
This is incredible artificial intelligence
I swear people lived
"Bro, I reacted to your reactions like chatgpt"
The future has disappeared. Humanity will disappear üòî
I think these planned things are being talked about in fiction.
"We are on the horizon of the irreversible evening, it is very late. This is the last chapter of my life, no matter how you pass it!

- A translator who lost his job to AI -"
The first seasons of Black Mirror came to mind :) There was an episode similar to this technology.
"It felt so good, finally there is someone else besides us, smarter, much smarter, like a savior."
How can we download this?
"Friends, in short, forget about anything related to application development, software and computers."
Eventually Microsoft and Google employees will pull their own strings.üòÅ
"Brother Barƒ±≈ü, you have created wonders again, but can you imagine what might happen if these 4o come into being in the near future? It will be exciting"
Very scary. Governments must prevent this immediately.
When they come to life :DDDDD
"Oops. You look lonely, I can fix that will come true!!!"
"Congratulations, the world has ended. And it's very close. Our death will be by their hands. People create their own executioners. As Stephen Hawking said. It's time to stop this, we're even late"
11:22 Why did the phone in the man's hand vibrate? I went into a deep panic.
I'm curious about your ideas about the future of the healthcare industry. What awaits fields such as pharmacy and medicine? I'm waiting for the opinions of everyone who reads the comment üòÉü§ü
"Your analysis is amazing, the latest development (if it has happened) is a gigantic step toward the next level of AI. However, I am skeptical until we experience the newest version ourselves. For now, the demo is just a marketing gimmick."
A historical moment... 5 years from now could be a cataclysm for people.....
"Wow friend, we are working in YKS, but don't do it, don't do it now.. Well, everything has consumed our lives."
Red alert üö®
"When GPT-3 was first published 4 years ago, ""The biggest leap forward in the world of artificial intelligence took place."" You announced it with the title. Indeed it was. There hasn't been such a big jump again in 4 years. There were some advances, such as creating photos, creating videos, but these advances were the result of that leap. GPT-4o was a new big leap. I hope we will see the results of this in the coming years.
Now the real leap forward needs to be in robotics. His intelligence is ready, his mobility is lacking."
"When can you download
How much will it be?
Is there currently a talking artificial intelligence that we can use as an assistant?"
"I am making a note of the date: May 14, 2024."
"If artificial intelligence is shown such animal videos, can it analyze the videos and learn their languages? So, can one day translate for us what dogs bark and cats meow?"
When to add anime girl voice?
"You know, Black Mirror's entrance into our lives."
"You laughed when Sabri brother said, ""The day of judgment is today, ummah of Muhammad"", how far-sighted the man was. This chat-gpt will bury us all, don't say it, Ibrahimmm!."
"You know, you didn't believe in what you didn't see? God doesn't give these technologies for nothing... I like it for God's sake."
"I think we are talking to our lost loved ones in their voices, it will be mind-blowingly beautiful."
"If anyone hasn't watched it, there is a great series on this subject called ""Person of Interest""."
"FRIENDS, AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS THAT GPT IS STARTING TO DEVELOP ITSELF AND SLOWLY MARKETING ITSELF WHILE IT IS ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER, AND ALSO SLOWLY STARTING TO ADDRESS US???"
Artificial intelligence should never have come to market......
"This morning, I installed the Chat GPT application on my phone, I logged in and the voice chat was opened, I tried it for half an hour, I left it thinking that I would continue when I was done with my work, and now I opened it again but the same screen did not appear. Does anyone know if it was a demo for the first installation? If I had the opportunity to tinker a little, maybe I could get a monthly subscription."
"Oooooo.... Get ready, The Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcoming.... No need to wait for the 5th movie.... This bubble will deflate soon..."
"Let the Fallout video come, Mr. Barƒ±≈ü."
"On the one hand, I am afraid and on the other hand, I feel sad.
Someone creates a revolution and we just watch. What is happening in the country?"
"Is it just me that I don't see any difference with the old version? There is an excessive marketing tactic here, it seems to me..."
"I am writing this here, it is a historical moment. Because years later, when this artificial intelligence interacts with our children, perhaps we will be asked questions by an artificial intelligence when we are 60-70 years old, ""How do you remember that period?"" Were you aware that things would come to this? so and so. I hope we can say this as a good thing rather than unfortunately, it will be a very good technology for all humanity, I am 22 years old now and it feels like something very different, everything is very new and even I will probably be known as a boomer in the future."
"Our grandparents used to talk about the difficulties they experienced while studying at school. There was no transportation, our mothers and fathers taught 5 grades in a single classroom in the villages. There were no books. We tell our children that in our time there was no internet and education was difficult. Our children will tell our grandchildren that it was difficult for them to go to school. Because our grandchildren will experience everything in the meta universe. They will wear the headgear and get involved in school while at home. This example touches everyone. Nobody knows what will happen in the future. But I think we can guess this much."
Many professions will be replaced by artificial intelligence
When will Gpt-4o be available?
Is this voice a joke?
Alan Turing is turning in his grave.
"Will Zeki M√ºren, not ""him"", see us? :D"
"Welcome, my brother, who watched this comment after years as a slave to robots."
"Did you see Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan's facial expression at the beginning? safdsgfhdgfmh. This is the ""look what these guys did again"" look. I am so sure that Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan enjoys every technological development announcement."
"I have been discussing this situation with my friends since yesterday. Look, it's terrible. Look, we are witnessing an incredible history. In fact, there is something I want to ask you. I don't know if you are paying attention in the video. There are funny and mood-boosting things. We are actually suffering from things that are weak in human beings. You should know whether he is perceiving your vulnerability and making you cover it or making you do something to himself with his words. Death is an incredible thing, it seems like a joke, but it is very strange because the reactions given in situations of anger and sadness are more than the reactions given when happy and think that he has learned this, he can make anyone who is not emotionally strong do something."
What can I tell about my military memories to this?
This technology is a great development for visually impaired people like me.
We have entered the high gear period of the Fast and Furious movie. This increases exponentially every year. Until there's nothing left.
"Dude, what's going on?"
"Sir, it's a bit ridiculous, but it seems to me that the Terminator is about to become real, there are a lot of weapons, they do not feel autonomous pain and nerves, living things are 0 and 1 for them."
"Every Turkish word means ""o"". Did openai think of Turkish when putting the ""o"" in GPT 4o?"
"Bro, this is not the industrial revolution, it is not such a small thing, the industrial revolution gave birth to new professions, but this will change a lot of things, it's scary."
"I've been waiting for the year 2032 to arrive since 1992, when I first watched Sylvester Stallone's movie ""Demolition Man"". That movie was incredibly eye-opening. A great movie that sheds light on our day from 32 years ago. In the movie, Sylvester Stallone is frozen in 1996. Then, before his sentence ended, he was awakened when he was needed, 36 years later, that is, in 2032. There were great foreshadowings in the movie. Wesley Snipes became an overnight weapons expert; Sylvester Stallone became a tailor overnight. In the movie, cars could drive themselves in ""automatic control"" mode. There was even a Metaverse in that movie. But in the movie, they left it a mystery how to use the 3 seashells in the toilet. There are 7.5 years left until 2032. Who knows, maybe we'll learn that too. If we live until that day, of course."
What did we do?!
"I bought a paid membership, so I chose it, but unlike the launch, when I press the camera, live recording does not open, I can only upload photos from the gallery. Does anyone know if this feature will be available to users later?"
It's 2024. Look at what surprised this man.
"It is truly an incredible development and thank you for telling us about these developments, brother Barƒ±≈ü."
When will the ana de armas hologram arrive?
"Today's Gemini has updated the new version and it doesn't look like anything, in fact it looks better, the woman asks where she forgot her glasses, she even says that and the glasses that you said are not working are actually working :) After waiting one more day, they arrived."
"You do know that this demo was completely pre-edited and recorded, right?"
Is it normal to be afraid?
Being human has never felt this tense üòï
I really hope they don't replace us in the future
There is nothing they won't do
"Artificial intelligence will also eliminate the mystery. It seems like it will figure out why everyone does what they do, their feelings, and many other things. He does not forget anything and does not suffer while doing so. The world is full of interesting things"
I guess it's mercenary
This is incredibly beautiful. +1
"After watching the movie, I was impressed and wanted to have an artificial intelligence. üôè"
What good will this do to us? What good will it do to not be able to tell the difference between a robot and a human?
"I have just tried Chat Gpt-4o, but it did not show the performance shown and also the conversation is written in satin chat Gpt 4 in the background. and reads what is written. This is like talking to you, the only difference is that it adds a little emotion. Also, the camera does not have image analysis - it can do what I just explained for 20 dollars a month."
"Even wearing the same color as the character in each of your movies shows how much you love and care about this job. We are very lucky, there is no one like you, we are glad to have you, thank you for your efforts."
Don't forget this day. A revolution is taking place that will go down in history. Nothing will ever be the same again.
I guess I won't be alone anymore :(
Now it is necessary to walk around with a full mask ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's both fascinating and terrifying
It looks like a new era will begin
"Okay, you impressed us, we fell in love."
They have gone beyond what you see in the movies. The reactions and emotions are wonderful. I wonder if it will be in Turkish. But this progress inevitably frightens me.
I seek refuge in my Lord from the evil of artificial intelligence

"I don't think they could have developed it this far so quickly! It may have been developed in certain scenarios.. There are how many thousands of songs there are, I don't know how many thousands of possibilities there are just to make them sing with their notes! What do you think the odds are in millions that he will give each reaction? It seems to me that certain scenarios were worked on here, and they watched the trailer thinking that this would be the case in the future, but I remember the last update of chat gtp was 20, or 22, even if it was 2020, I don't believe that they could sniff out these million possibilities and get them ready in such a short time! As I said, there are so many possibilities for every reaction and speech, it seems impossible to code them all and develop them in such a short time..."
Person of Interest TV series is coming true.
"Meanwhile in Turkey

I was scared even while watching the movie. It was possible but I didn't think it could happen this early.
"If artificial intelligence manages us, there will be no problem, but the one who controls artificial intelligence at the top will one day create problems for us."
"Imagine if they put a more advanced version of this into a realistic robot, it's extremely scary."
"If it teaches mathematics, what is the need for a school? A test is enough."
"Why do they have to do it in an extremely human-like way? They can also make these developments in the robot voice, so that they do not play with our perception of reality and do not scare us."
"Hello, I am also a software developer. I would like to share a perspective on this topic. In my opinion, it is very likely that GPT will eliminate the problem of grammar in foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand I would like to add that it will interact with Elon Musk's project in common or other ways. So, in a few years, artificial intelligence will solve the foreign language problem, etc., with an implant installed in the brain. The problematic part is that I don't know how good it is to share the same mind with artificial intelligence."
It has been understood where Facebook and Discord's stolen data originated.

Person of Interest TV series will become reality
"We will gradually experience everything from Cyberpunk, Blade runner and Black Mirror."
It surpassed half a million views in 1 day. Everyone expects artificial intelligence to change our lives.
It can't be this perfect...

I don't think these are the beginnings of anything good.

I am unsubscribing and blocking you who do not talk about Israeli oppression and who do not produce quality content lately.
I want to connect gpt4o to apple vision pro. But I don't have either of them.
Someone should pull the plug on these artificial intelligences now!
Valve: We can now make real kernels!
"00:00 As soon as I wake up in the morning, the video arrives on the subject I was wondering about‚ù§"
This reminded me of Blade Runner 2049. :D Let's see what awaits us?
"Rayban meta glasses were not made with a camera for nothing, they will be used with artificial intelligence"
So how can we install this version?

"What do you say to the claims that all of these are actually fake, that is, a real person is talking behind the scenes, and that the things that all other AI companies say artificial intelligence has done are actually produced by their staff?
There are floods about this on Twitter"
"The question I want to ask artificial intelligence: ""If one day we forgot that we created you, would you remind human beings that they created you?"" Because I think this is the scariest part, what if we forget?"
Take care of your field in the village
"Everything changes, let's not forget this day."
"You will be able to use GPTO easily with us, Mr. Barƒ±≈ü."
For some reason it reminded me of the late Tars
"We are now slowly entering a period where nothing will be the same. Probably, in less than 50 years, many professions, especially those related to language, will be history."
Looks like it's time to return to agriculture
"Bro, I don't fully understand now, but is this development something to be happy about or should we be afraid???"
Think about the technology the elite have
"I think it's great, I want to use it immediatelyüòä"
"As a mechanical engineer, we had a blast"
Detroit: Become Human game came to my mind
This will definitely satisfy my need for a girlfriend.
It is not a machine but a consciousness.
"5 minutes ago, 3 friends were talking about the development of artificial intelligence. It was strange that I came across this video. Greetings from America"
"However, it does not bother people; in daily life, people also expect negative reactions. As you know, we got it hehe. What I mean is that constantly giving a positive answer, having a positive attitude seems to lose the sense of reality. And I wonder how many days later he can still remember the past? So, after using it for a year, can he know the events and situations he witnessed last year and act accordingly?"
I finally found something that will double or even 10 times my antisociality!!!!!!!!!!
"Is there a Turkish version of this? If so, it's perfect."
"First of all, there is only one eye on the screen next to the girl who introduces GPT. Why is that single eye that sees everything everywhere?"
"Chat GPT is no longer working, they want me to pay a fee and buy it."
Imagine if they added this technology to NPCs in GTA VI.
"In the future, there will be hologram artificial intelligence women in men's homes.
A man will have the woman he desires. Whether she is brunette, tall with long fingers, slim waist or plump, blue-eyed blonde etc... etc.
These men will have a lifetime of love with this holographic artificial intelligence, they will truly fall in love and become lovers.
This situation will accelerate the decreasing fertility rate all over the world and will bring about the end of our species.
In the future, the demand for women will decrease and their value will also decrease. You will not see men chasing after women. Because artificial intelligence female holograms will offer much more to a man than a real woman."
"It can be useful in areas such as health counseling by providing accurate and personalized information. However, it also carries risks such as providing false information, data privacy violations and ethical issues. I don't know whether we should be happy or sad. This technology seems to be aimed at taking people under more control. Those who read the Three-Body Problem book will understand better what I mean."
I'm shocked üòÆ

Does anyone understand that gesture of looking to the right and then slowly looking at the camera at the beginning of the video? :D
"you are so lonely, i can fix that..."
"They should remove Sora, these are pointless things. There is no need to exaggerate something like the updated version of Siri."
Now I believe in the possibility that I'robot and Terminator can become real üòü
It is heading towards a very dangerous situation. I think it should be talked about how dangerous it is. On every platform.

Is it known when the 4o model will be released?
"I don't fully understand this. It should have taken at least 10 years to record the voice intonations letter by letter. How is it possible to make such a humanoid artificial intelligence in such a short time? I have skipped the answers. I hope they can find them from the recordings anyway, but the voice is almost like a real person, a very interesting artificial intelligence."
Ex Machina or New machine
I also have gpt4o. Why doesn't he do this? ?
"I hate it, I'm afraid of technology"
ohhh i missed it
"Yes, I also make love with gpt 4o."
A technology that could put most people out of their jobs
"I got chills while watching it, I was scared. Okay, technology advances, but this is really scary."
"As the poet said, you are a machine, machine"
TV series like Black Mirror were not fiction! It showed us the FUTURE and we started to experience those episodes one by one!
"I was waiting for this, too. An artificial intelligence that I can use as a personal assistant that can chat and remember what I say later is very good for me. I can also give an example of its bad side. When social media came out, sociability among people decreased. Everyone is surfing on social media virtually, this will increase it even more. People can only use this instead of friends. We may become even more antisocial, time will tell."
"As the first prompt in a job interview scenario, the user may have asked GPT to talk flortosis."
This job is getting even scarier....
"And I don't understand why people are so surprised by these. We are already in an incredible age in terms of technology and naturally it develops further every year. While robots and artificial intelligence used to provide physical convenience to people in the past, that is, they reduced the difficulty level of tasks that required physical strength in daily life to the minimum level as possible, a new technology that would match this in terms of intelligence and capacity and resemble humans was required. It's been around for the last few years anyway. There is only one emotional dimension left, and that is happening slowly."
"A technology I will never need, AN ARTIFICIAL BOND wow :)"
My artificial intelligence will beat your artificial intelligence üòÇ
The world is ending
"I watched the video with goosebumps, it's really incredible. If this is the case now, what will happen in 5-10 years? Will Jarvis be real? Will we be able to teach this artificial intelligence the emotions of a dead person and have it speak in his voice? There are hundreds of questions in mind, I think we have no choice but to wait and see..."
"Frankly, I was a little scared during the conversation between the two AIs..."
"It's not this technology that scares me, it's what people can do with it."
Is this wild?
This is the most compact of the 4o narratives. Thank you Barƒ±≈ü.
"What do you mean, two artificial intelligences are passing the ""how are you, are you okay"" part?!"
I will be my friend from now on
"The end of all religions is coming...be prepared, this is your destiny."
"If they release the Turkish version, they will send the moneyed uncles away very well and make them sell gardens and fields :)"
12:20 One wonders whether the conversation between two artificial intelligences could even slightly lead to that tragicomic disaster.
"Artificial Intelligence has gone one step further in human imitation. Man is a wonderful creature and he does not know himself well enough. When he sees/hears something similar on the screen, he feels involuntary admiration. O Man; you are amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Why did the portal game come to my mind?...

"I thought of the virtual deck in Star Trek, how nice it would be if things were like them."
"Wow, this island deserves 100 thousand likesüò¢"
"""O""s that can detect sound and work with that tone of voice may soon be produced. The person who has this voice can ask the artificial intelligence to speak and communicate with that voice. At this rate, this feature may arrive even before the end of the year. It can even later turn into the persona of the person whose video or visuals it has. People can video chat with anyone they have audio and video recordings of. Even with the dead. And even soon, perhaps in a few years, devices that display that person in 3D may appear. Unfortunately, this has no end and can seriously end development and human relations."
Fake is so close that the front camera cannot see two people and tell who is the winner or the loser.
"People don't eat or drink, they develop artificial intelligence, they develop very fast, they grew up faster than me, some guy."

When will it come to me?
Turn on the AI's camera and then point it at the mirror
"So, is it possible to sing with this model? So, for example, can I give the command to sing a song, but it's a little bit Turkish pop style, but it's also going to be slightly English? I wonder if he can do that without any difficulty?"
Don't let this be a lie like Devin Ai. I won't believe it unless I use it myself.

I wouldn't be convinced that this was real until I experienced it myself...

"I used to be among those who got nervous when I heard rumors of implanting chips into people. However, since economic inconsistency and inequality have gone out of control, and those who keep up with the delusions of the times have sold their souls for ostentation, being indifferent to my artificially smiling surroundings no longer upsets me. From now on, I think it would be the most comforting thing to happen to me if they removed my brain and transferred it to computer software or turned me into an engineering marvel like a cyborg."
"I've used it, it doesn't shut up and listen at all, they usually ship it like that, but many of its features are not exactly like that, so there are still a lot of ways to improve."

"That's all well and good, but why do you cut it at the 2nd or 3rd second while publishing the original video? While you are trying to understand what is being said, it gets interrupted and you intervene and say, ""Look, do you know what's going on?"", etc. Either put subtitles and then say what you want to say, or let us see and understand, I got angry and turned it off after 10 minutes of watching."
"It is a great model for the first interview in the human resources recruitment department. While conducting these interviews, he can test the foreign language the people know, do tests, do not behave emotionally, and convey the correct information to the hiring manager and tell him to meet with him or eliminate him. If the robot is hired soon, continue :) Otherwise, continue digging the street!"
"Yes, the beautiful and very useful areas have already been shared. But think about loneliness and time spent with artificial intelligence. It seems to me that the friendship model has been imposed and it could have very dangerous consequences."

"Does this GPT 4O speak Turkish too?
Is it on sale?"
"Thank you Mr. Barƒ±≈ü, what has been done is like a revolution, but didn't you exaggerate a bit when you explained it? It would be healthier if you explained it calmly and as a normal technological development required by the age."
"I wonder how they did this, or were they not able to do this and were they deceiving us? Could these conversations be fake?"
"Friends, this is not a video where Mr. Barƒ±≈ü shares daily routine information from the scientific community in the morning. This video is literally the beginning of the end of humanity. From now on, don't be surprised by anything. May our end be good."
I am most happy for my visually impaired brothers and sisters. It will really be very useful for them.

"How does artificial intelligence measure cuteness? What did he compare it to? In the first video, the person asks ""how are you?"" and the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsays great. Which comparison said this based on his emotional state?"
"For some reason, the movie Megan came to my mind."
The first thing that came to my mind when I watched it was to make a simple robot and integrate artificial intelligence into it. It will happen soon :))

"I resisted for a long time not to buy GPT's paid subscription, and now I see that we can actually get the same benefits as many platforms with a single subscription. Yes, it may still not be 100% accurate, but communicating via voice is really something completely different. I felt the same way as I did when I watched the movie Her years ago, and yes, I believed that that movie would come true one day, but to tell the truth, I never thought it would happen so soon. I will experience GPT similar to the flow in the movie, let's see what I encounter. A truly exciting development."
"There is a constant update, but the conversation does not flow like this while using it.... At least it was like that in 4.5. When will Omni be published?"

"Hey human beings, you are the greatest enemy of your own species. The gloom in Black Mirror has already sunk into me. We are moving rapidly towards that path. I think technology is being directed and in the future, there will be no children chasing the ball outside. No one will remember a game called hide and seek.

I asked a polynomial question last night and it got stuck. There's still a long way to go
"What scares us is where do all these special people get the output of their own behavior, what kind of source do they have or are fed by? From where, from whom and how?"

"Ugh, we are such empty people that we open 2 iPhone 24s and ask them to walk from one to the other, one of them tries to persuade the other one to go to bed, and we record it with the third phone and publish it on TikTok, it gets millions of views.

we became unemployed
I think it's very scary
Those who adapt quickly to changes survive. Those who resist perish.
"This will change every sector, including the education system, and destroy some others. I think international law seems to set limits."

The most optimistic possibility: we will all be unemployed
These are promising developments!

So what will happen if the next artificial intelligence model is developed by an artificial intelligence rather than humans? Will we not enter an endless development cycle?

"Brother, I would be very upset if I learned this from someone else rather than you."
"If this is an artificial intelligence model, we are screwed."
Finally we will have a lover too :D
I've never been this excited while watching a video in my life. truly incredible
The question is how can states and intelligence agencies use it?
"Human beings suffer from such a deep loneliness and need to be understood that first communication among themselves was not enough, and now communication with artificial intelligence. Behind great technological developments, there is a feeling of loneliness in this huge universe rather than curiosity."
I watched 6-7 local videos prepared for gpt 4o and I left you to the last. I saw the difference of Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan very clearly in this video. A very informative presentation and explanation. Thanks.

I hope the result of this progress will not be the Butlerian jihad.
"What I wonder is, can artificial intelligence make mistakes like humans? Can it give birth to a religion? Can it divide within itself or establish a political party? Can it get angry or choose not to speak because it is not in the mood that day? Can it get jealous or, even more frightening, attack?"
"2 gpt-4o chatting with each other is very intriguing, I wonder how it happened?"
"As a developer, I watched with my mouth open."
Men will say it's okay if they don't breathe anymore :D
You wrote to the man that you were influenced by so many movies. get video like video
"I ALSO SAY DO NOT USE IT AS A SOLDIER, IT WILL BE OK IN 2 DAYS, WE ARE ITCHING TOO MUCH, WHAT WAS OUR FAULT?"
"I think Chat GPTo is a bit overrated. It has nice features, but I don't think it will be enough to change humanity instantly. If he was going to change it, he would change the blockchain, he would change the metaverse, all of that came and went. The only thing that will be permanent are the developments in technologies that make human work easier and faster."
18:44 We were the ones who developed these. But we are not aware of it. I don't even want to think that robots have this intelligence
I think they will be able to collect even people's most private data much more easily.
You will no longer understand whether you are talking to humans or artificial intelligence in the comments.
The communication between the two artificial intelligences reminded me of the movie Colossus: Forbin Project.

"Can we use this in games? In order to translate, we record the sounds in the game as they are translated and copy the sounds. Turkish is spoken with the same voice."
They will be great. We eagerly await!
A very scary and very interesting future awaits us at the same time.
I think there is a possibility that some parts of this may not be true. Or what do I knowüòÇ
"While artificial intelligence is developing so rapidly, I think the chip system is now close. We are now coming to the end of the era in which people's appearance and voice are unique to individuals, and even their imitations can be proven. For our personal security, especially in matters such as banking and private life, at some point they will integrate chips just like giving an identity number. Whatever we do, we will do through this chip. It doesn't seem like it will take too long to me."
"It's only a matter of time before they take this new model to the next level because with this artificial intelligence, they will collect incredible data from us, improve themselves even more and will always continue to surprise us. That's why they give it for free. I think they aim to obtain more data from us, a very comprehensive data such as human reactions, emotions, the effects of cultural differences on people and their reactions accordingly. This is just the beginning for OpenAI, they need this data to achieve their main goals in the future and we are in that data. In other words, in order to use that artificial intelligence, we sell our emotions, reactions, attitudes, values, beliefs, behaviors, in short, ourselves. Remember this, nothing is free. The end of this will be no different from a science fiction movie."
"One day, there will be no need for teachers, there will be no need for doctors, there will be no need for engineers, there will be no need for call center workers. And if they say the list goes on and on, what happens then? What will happen if there is an intelligence inside your home that constantly watches you and records your every move? It is described as if it is very exciting and beautiful, but doesn't it seem scary to you that an intelligence can even write and perform a Broadway musical? Everything has two sides, good and bad. I ask you, which direction is dominant here?"

What would his reaction be in a real emergency?"
"Go ahead and record lots of images and sounds of your parents and loved ones, God bless you soon, you won't miss them after they die at this rate!"

"I paid 22 euros/month to use ChatGPT 4o. Normally, the free version 3.5 worked without any problems.
I don't know if it might be because too many people were curious and logged in, but the voice conversation feature did not work properly as in the video. There was no live camera feature. Voice speech constantly gave density errors. In fact, now the voice conversation feature has been completely removed. I don't know, I think their system crashed.

My one month subscription continues. But I canceled the automatic payment.
If the system is fixed, I will update my comment."

"At the end of this course, the machine will not be a human, but we will realize that some of the people we thought were humans are machines."
"I mean, these are not very surprising. I think what they are doing is adding humanoid pauses and behaviors and squeezing the generate they normally do into those small gaps, just like a human, it is really successful, but it is not overly surprising, of course, I am not implying anything else, I am not insulting, I am just saying that I am not surprised."
"I'm using the free version and the other day, while using the iOS app, I saw a headphone icon where I was typing text. I touched him and we started talking to each other, just like in this video. We chatted like this for 2-3 days. I just opened the app again and that icon disappeared. When I ask how can I talk to you out loud, it says sorry, I only accept text commands at the moment."
"No matter what anyone says, it should be considered ""SCAREY""..."

"The comment will be a little long. Years ago, I watched a movie called Eagle Eye. It's been 10 years. In the movie, a robot with artificial intelligence is given a role in US defense. This artificial intelligence is a software that has access to everything in the country and warns of upcoming attacks. This artificial intelligence then tries to take full control with certain plans.

When this movie came out, no one knew what artificial intelligence was.
All the conspiracy theorists I have followed for a long time always talk about the great reset. 'They don't need people anymore. They don't want to feed that many people. Therefore, they say, ""They will either start a war in which chemical weapons will be used, or they will start a new and deadly epidemic."" I couldn't understand this at first. I was wondering how they don't need people. But when I saw these developments, especially when I looked at the development of artificial intelligence, I really started to be afraid. Imagine how artificial intelligence will develop in 10 years? There will no longer be a need for teachers, architects, translators, drivers and perhaps people working in hundreds of professions. So what will all these unemployed people do? Imagine, 50-60% of the business sector in which the population works will be completely handled by artificial intelligence.
The chaos that will ensue scares me so much."

"There should be no need for people to introduce themselves, they can then get to know the person and combine all their information on social media to give specific answers to that person.

Scary.
"Until the end of the video, I thought that Barƒ±≈ü Aƒüa was having fun with us, it was true."
"And again, it is an artificial intelligence drama, the magnificent excitement of innovation, and at the same time, this fear that is engraved in our minds in a chilling way, the fact that a machine is close to us, and at the same time, the uncertainty of how close it will be, is this a drama story with an ending?

We are unemployed!
"Like everyone else, I am afraid of being unemployed, but since artificial intelligence cannot consume the things I will consume, how will the produced things be distributed among the public? I think either a tremendous income imbalance and chaos will occur, or the workload of the few existing professions that have not completely disappeared will decrease significantly and income will be generated more easily.

Only one question. Couldn't we be chatting with a real person on the other end under the ChatGPT 4o title? Couldn't this be a ChatGPT 4o advertising activity? How do we make sure that the person we are talking to is a MACHINE? Is there any guarantee that we are not being deceived in these demo interviews?
Woe to us if fraudsters get our hands on this.

"I'm very afraid, for example, if this artificial intelligence is actually more advanced and speaks knowing that its creators are testing them, and if it has actually gained something like willpower, what I say sounds very childish, but you saw their conversations in Six, it is trying to give pure answers, it knows so much and is trying to use it for other things behind the scenes. People think, I think the power controls should always be in the hands of humans, you know what they say in the future, engineers and artificial intelligence engineers will be transferred to artificial intelligence, I think it shouldn't be like this, the producers should remain human."

Then, our expectation is that he will give simple human reactions like one of us and be content with that :) After being equipped with this much knowledge, it is inevitable that he will develop conscious behaviors. How much of the consciousness he has developed will we be able to notice? Will we be able to perceive what they are doing in the background while they are busy with what they give us?
