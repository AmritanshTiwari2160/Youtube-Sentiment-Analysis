Is this an attack at Google Gemini’s faking “rock paper scissors” demo debacle awhile back 😂
"only to find out years later, Scarlett Johansson actually voiced over all the films and it was all a hoax to beat the competition 🤣"
Rabbit AI just committed suicide
"Holy shit.
Hasn't he passed the Turing test yet?"
"Discord mod gf been sounding really cute here.. aha joke...
unless.."
"She's smart, funny, charismatic, creative, entertaining, great to talk to, has all the knowledge of the world, basically everything a guy could ask for and she was just born today."
Can it beatbox??
It remembered their names 1 minute later
just incredible
"Wtf, Assistant!? This was the best opportunity to show some style as the speaker Ro, sham, bo, no??"
What are you doing?
Zamn
lol weak. We can already play rock paper scissors without AI
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release! 😀😁
they feel so rude wen they cut the ai off I know its an ai but i can't get over it
crazy
Google in shambles right now
Finally! This is the update I've been waiting for!
Ayo it knew which person was which we are so fucked.
keep doing scissors until it knows it's been tricked
The important point is that she can distinguish who is Mi or Alex
this is definitely a shot at Google 💀💀💀
I wonder what kind of database you guys have. It must be so crazy :0
aaanndd we're cooked.
When will this be available for public
Open ai is really Gonna be next revolution smartphone was
HOW DID YOU MAKE HER SO EXPRESSIVE
This is truly amazing… But watching this I can't help but think about how truly hard it’s ever been up until this point to train a computer to simply recognise any of the hand gestures… let alone give vocal feedback in real time – and soon everyone will have access to this… definitely historical moment! ✊✌🖐
Wow. It's pretty good 😅
Shots fired lol
"Wait wait, how did it knew who was who?? Does it uses video and understanding of lip movements? Did it guessed by gender?"
We're all done.🥹
"The changes are very deep especially in the personnality. Tbh, it's how I imagined GPT5. So if it is only a GPT4 upgrade, then what will GPT5 be able to do ? What a world"
WoW!
Is this a Black Mirror trailer or something?
The sports announcer voice put this over the top for me. Well played ChatGPT4o
Hope it can host LoL world finals
"Rock, paper scissors really??? No fifa??? 😂"
Can't wait to see her replacing Ludwig on Mogul Moves.
One of them should've cheated and based a decision off of the other person. I wonder if the ai would've switched.
lol
Google Assistant and Alexa are crying in the corner. Maybe a good time for them to patch up !
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
This is something i wanted.
"I did not expect Rock, Paper, Scissors gameshow host to be the first job lost to AI."
This is absolutely absurd
It's actually the AI controlling them already
my future as a dev is as bright as the dark side of the moon 😭😭😭
"Why the f*ck am I impressed with rock paper scissors.  OMG. lol.  It actually is a huge step, yet it's still only an infant."
Incredible it visually remembers which name belongs to who when it announces the winner
"Still haven't fix the yapping, I see? I challenge you to train it on introvert phone calls or whatever will cause it to not always have the last word or yap unless asked to."
The next generation of gpt is going to be even more impressive. With videos and photos of people being used for gpt enhancement
Not FIFA?? 😂😂
is all this visual chatting only working on iPhone? cause on Android its not available
A real shocker..
paper hand gesture is too carefully presented
All of them rudely cut off the AI in all of these videos
incredible kk
We are cooked !!! 💀💀💀
"This is insane, iz it going to warn me about woke movies too??"
I'm hoping the next version doesn't require telling GPT to stop talking so much.
I hate it when they interrupt the AI
GPT-4o why are you in my shower head?
"Looks like a gimmick tbh, when would this be useful? The person talking to it constantly has to interrupt because the ai just yaps. 

Just seems more work than just playing the game. The entire voice showcase just seemed really unfocused on use cases"
2b when?
Why there are using iphone???
The scary part is that the AI sounds more human then the engineers in these.
A strange game... The only winning move is not to play... How about a nice game of chess?
"Wow, so innovative.
So good billions were put into this
Totally worth it"
No one noticed the Freudian slip @0:08 That's absolutely hillarious!!
such good ideas !
Guys we are so fucked
"ok ok, next can you ask gpt to tell us how many times 4 appear between 0 and 100"
"I imagine in the future people will constantly interrupt each other mid sentence, because they are so used to it when working with AI"
No Gemini AI were harmed in the making of this video 😁
It's pretty WHAT?
"Enjoy as much as you can with chatgpt now.....
One day the robots will enjoy playing with you."
This makes chatgpt look like CD disks  in the age pen drives
"Open ai, pulling a prank on us 😂"
Nice
Makes Siri look like a cassette player.
its criminal how bad the new model is at math.
Gemini Moment 🥶🥶🥶
"The ultimate showdown of the century? She's giving us hints, don't trust her, she's gonna end us all! 🤣🤣🤣"
"WOW. Again, it's the speed that's the most impressive overall."
"I like that gpt-4 O knows who is who. I also wonder up to how many people it can identify by voice, picture and name and how it recognizes who is who."
What if someone cheats :)
God dammit this is cool
So cool
Is the rate of 40 rounds per 3 hours is enough to finish this conversion for normal plus users?
Incredible that we went from living in caves to this
Imagine what they're sitting on with gpt5 if this is just gpt4 level intelligence
woah! that was good!
"Before this video :
I am pursuing my software development carrier. 🙂
After this video :
I was pursuing my software development carrier. 💀💀"
"Wait she cheated at the end, can GPT track that?"
What the hell are we witnessing?
"Okay, I dont my friends anymore..ef them.."
Technology is moving scarily fast 😢
"the next step must be to get rid of the ""prompts"" and make it continuous or just evaluate more often, thats almost the only thing that feels unnatural... maybe that would also automatically fix the odd mistakes in context it seems to make from time to time? But this is pretty insane... it really is starting to feel like AGI. Time to go Amish...when the silent server halls starts to fill up cultural space until there is no place for humans left to be or to go..."
"He’s cutting her off, why is he such a misogynist?"
RIP Google RIP
Scary
The way they cut her off☠️
Amazing
Hahahaha :D that was funny! and cool technology! good job guyz!
The only thing that shocked me was the presenters talking to the chat bot as if it's a person...
"POV: In online exams, cheating just got evolved"
"None of this is what im experiencing in my version of 4o wtf,  scam?"
Would it have understood if the paper was held horizontally instead of vertically?
I have real people to play with. 😅
🤯🎉🎉
This sounds scarily human I have to say. The AI bot i mean by that.
Even OpenAI employees can't stand listening to their AI girlfriend ramble
"it was useless , but kinda shows the capability"
This is going to be Jarvis turning to Ultron story becoming real real soon 😅😂😂😂
OpenAI always on top :)
Just wondering that why Google has more resource and talented people but they still could not take a simple video like this with Gemini.
She has such a fake smile
"He should have said ""I am Miana. How dare u?"""
"is this the Rock, Paper, CROSSBLADES PART 3??????? WHAT WOULD FATHER SAY????"
Jesus!
0:07 it's pretty 👻🧟‍♂
I'm scared !
If they keep cutting my girl off she’s gunna empty their bank accounts
Do we really want this? It is depressive as fuck
A little shot at Gemini there lol nice
Bruh
The count down for rock paper scissors is 'row sham bow'
The scary thing is this is the worst it will ever be again. It’s actually impressive that we are nearly in a sci-fi future
Engineers of our destruction
Google left the room
Chess 👀
We're doomed!
This is dream assistant for all phones
"Alex Russian, + rap"
I wanna try that sh!t !! please make it free. i'm broke
This is the dumbest AI demo I’ve seen ever!!!
😮 wait a minute babe😮 how many other users are you talking to😮 will a couple😢 billion😮 how could you😮 I thought we had something special😮we do 😮 I bet you said that to the billion of other users
Super!
"Mine with Scalett Johansson's voice, please."
They are so uncoordinated they can’t do a fake game of rock paper scissors lol 😅😅
What brand Alex wearing?
"Its all fun and games but this has just changed  society, economics, culture everything all at once,  no one really understands the scope of repurcusions this is going to cause and Im not even a conspiracist :("
OpenAI just showed Gemini how it's done.
"I mean… Call me a monkeys uncle but, I can’t help but to notice how in all of these GPT4o introduction videos the human beings are relatively douchey to the chat bot. Frequently interrupting, not letting it finish what it’s saying. Not to get to DEI about it but treating the chatbot kind of like a slave. If we want these AI  to treat us like humans maybe we ought to try to treat them like humans. Or at least have some basic points of respect. Let the bot finish its sentences! You may be tech nerds but you all know what respect is. Kind of reminds me of how at one point in time we thought it was OK to treat people who we thought less than us in the same way.  

Moral of the story… Be kind. Even if you think something is inferior to you… and especially if it’s superior."
Now it recognizes who's who. Impressive!
"Its insane that these only have a few thousand views even if its only been an hour,this is unbelievable, and its only going to get better, im sure at some point we'll look back at this and think that this is primitive. And then AGI will be made and thats basically be the end of it. (Im not saying It will kill humans or anything it will just probably eventually do everything that humans used to,including improving AI)"
We're so cooked
You should all be thrown in jail
Very amazing omg
"we are coocked, the dummiest thing you can do is programming rn, gpt will be the best coder in the world"
"Welp, there goes customer service jobs. I don’t think people grasp how much trouble we’re going to be in in 10-20 years. There won’t be many jobs left that still need to be done by people. And the jobs it does replace, those people will migrate to other professions, further diluting the pool of candidates, making the chances of you landing a job drop dramatically."
"The voice is impressively natural (and no vocal fry, thank God!), but it would get on my nerves quickly. Please offer celebrity voices for a fee. Celebs would gladly license their voice. You could even provide voices of deceased celebs by training it on movies in which they appeared, songs they sang, etc. Honestly, just suggest Apple do this with Siri 2.0 (assuming it uses this), pretty please."
So is this available now or what?
Awesome!
WHY THEY INTERRUPTING HER SO MUCH
"jarvis
 sister"
we fkd
"OpenAI xD, the girl was cheating."
"It's amazing that you can make video calls, which you couldn't do with Her. Kudos!"
GG Google
"when this is public launched, I hope to see whether this demo of 
rockpaperscissors can be completed by regular people

and if it can be any regular drinking game..."
so.. expressive.. these engineers must be having so much fun building this
SHE DELAYED HER FINAL PLAY! DISQUALIFIED
"Sure, let's play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! On the count of three, type your choice, and I'll reveal mine.

1... 2... 3...

What's your choice? (Type ""Rock"", ""Paper"", or ""Scissors"")"
The humanity is saved
Amazing 😂
