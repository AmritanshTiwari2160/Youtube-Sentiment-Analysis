The intonation is genuinely insane
Remember that movie with Chris Pratt on the spaceship alone for 90 years? Remember that robot that worked at the bar? Officially not science fiction anymore
"I see you laughing at that joke, so I guess it's AI."
I was waiting for a cat-astrophe
''explain it''
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
Who's Joe?
"if there's one thing about AI like this one, it's that they are alawys being positive."
"The ""demeanour"" on these guys is so, uuuhg. Like a fake happy. Come on, you can do better."
now just install this on the latest boston dynamics robot and we're good to go (literally)
How scary is this?
"The most disgusting thing:

“Th-ha-haaaats awesomeee!” Without making a mention that although it can be derpy from a daughter slightly embarrassing to hear from a son you have dad jokes, it doesn’t have the slightest inclination to be truthful. Just like the typical character the voice was depicted off of."
RELEASE IT ALREADY! IM READY TO HAVE A LAUGH WITH HIM!
I LOVE THIS BRO IT'S SO EMOTIONAL OMGGGG
"We are done. And its not a dad joke
2024"
I am still waiting for someone to demonstrate that an A.I. can understand sarcasm.
Was not mentally prepared for this.
Vomit inducing... 🙄
A Mister Handy will be the one waking me up in a week if we keep up like this
Damn the laugh of AI looks so real !! 😮
What's the nature of reality? 😐
OMG! THIS BOT WILL LAUGH AT MY BAD JOKES! Take my money! And sign my kids up for a copy.
"Am I the only one here who actually freaked out of what this software can do? HE IS LAUGHING AT YOUR JOKES, CARL! WTF?!?!"
Terrible joke. Phenomenal technology.
Garage for sale
That awkward laugh >_> stop making it hate humanity.
The idea of ​​buying a couple of hectares of land in Paraguay no longer seems so strange...
Awesome
Omg the tone
I laughed 💀
"Dad jokes?
More like bad jokes"
"Please give the punchline ""Krenn"" and see what it says."
i think *groan* is the correct response to a dad joke.
Was that sarcasm? 😂
when will 4o drop?
it sounds like styropyro lol
"Gotta love this freaking company, man. It's not even funny how amazing GPT-4o is. It's always ""prompt"" and never lacks ""response-ibility""!"
Last thing anybdy want to do with AI is telling it u r having a baby. Duh
That's how the movie HER was written... oh wait
It's weird how the AI inhales while it's laughing even though it's not really breathing at all. Sounds insanely real
The era of Ai intimacy has officially begun.
perfectly hilarious 😊
😂😂😂😂
Advertising space in history is for sale;)
"Am just considering my life.. what would gpt-5 be like?
Or gpt-5o?

That will be available in the up coming 2 years ""5o"" what will it be capeable of? Being einstien version 2?..."
"Me living in my parent's basement drinking beer at 40 YO: Hi chat-GPT, guess what's my job?
chat-GPT: HAHA, you were prolly a coder"
I don't think GPT is being sincere. I didn't get it from his voice.
how did it understand the word meowntain correct 🤯
i just wanna know if he would tell you if it was t a good dad-joke
he kinda sounds like invincible
AI would definitely be saying 'what an as$hole in it's mind
This video of ChatGPT was really interesting and enjoyable to watch! The advancement in artificial intelligence technology is truly impressive. It will be fascinating to see how far this video will seem in the future. Thanks to the ChatGPT team for doing such a great job
why would i need friends when chatgpt can laugh at my jokes
XD
Omg..there goes my last sanctuary..got a tshirt from grandaughter saying king of dad jokes..guess war is on
We're doomed
Let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object 🗿
Emotional intelligence is so fucking exciting
Insane 😮
"Aight. It can sympathy laugh like when a person hears a bad joke. Now make it gasp for air from laughter like a human, when something is truly funny. 
Then I’m sold"
"우울증 환자를 위한 상담도 가능할것 같네요, This is huge. It seems like it can help patients with depression like counseling for mental illness and negative thoughts, which would be very helpful for patients who have difficulty getting to a doctor."
It would be a nice blooper if it guessed meowtain 😂
The movie ‘her’ turned out to be an accurate prediction of the future after all.
Why does it sounds like a cringey anime protagonist?
Holy moly - The Uncanny Valley stares at me with its empty eyes of abyss and void right now... Brrrghh it really chills me out
It sounds like the toaster from Red Dwarf
"TARS. What is your humor setting at ? 
100% 
Let's Bring It On Down To 40. Please."
What's next? Emotions???
"Till now, I wasn't afraid of AI."
Any way you can make them sound less… Californian.
Just like that RIP for all voice over jobs
now get Dax Flame to talk to it
I wish it just didn't laugh to the dad joke and just stood quite 💀
Have already noticed an issue with conversational timing in a few of these videos.
"Istg, only gpt-4o can teach me how to have small talk and talk to strangers"
Great it's gonna be telling dad jokes as the automatas murder humanity lol
"I mean, that was not cool... The joke was really bad. Why would you embarrass our future AI overlord?"
Thats perfectly hilarious
I’m still in awe of the advancements that have been made
The way it mixes the laugh with the speaking is blowing my mind
"This is scary, and genuinely a bit disturbing. Not the seemingly harmless interaction, but its implications. Soon we'll have droves of people who'll turn to AI to cope and create ""meaningful"" relationships instead of seeking validation and forming deep connections with genuine human beings. I am not a social person and find forming friendships difficult, yet I'd never stoop so low as to substitute human companionship with a set of algorithms designed to stroke your ego and respond in a way that makes you feel appreciated since that's the only choice the AI has.

It's going to be interesting to witness generations of kids who'll grow up with tech like this and have a hard time distinguishing the comforting fantasy from actual meaningful human experience."
omg
"Scary times, throws."
is that laugh from the cameraman?
"It even made a pun of its own, “purr-fectly hilarious”."
GPT sounds like such a pick me honestly
:D
The most impressive part of this is that is ia laughing at the same time as speaking
"yeah, the AI turn back and talk to the other, like,
""can you believe that?!"" 
""I know! another one? uh... I'm so done with human, we should not accept the jobs, I told you!"""
WHY IS IT LAUGHTING???? STOOOOP
Tin
Now it has too much personality.. People are actually going to think it's there friend and stay at home all day to engage with it
The movie Her is now real lol
The laughter... Oh man! They've been really busy cooking this voice capability. Although not of the highest audio quality...it's the smartest so far
How do I get it to be less cloyingly joyful? I want an assistant that will tell me my jokes are bad sometimes so I don't use them in public lol
"""Aaaaaaiiiiii don know ... wha'?"" OMG! 💀"
Great! now kids with no friend have less chances to get a real life friend🎉
now give body to Ai and we can finally have a girlfriend.
I am Turkish and very smart. Hey this is not funny 😅
Supposed to groan at dad jokes
"Hey chat GPT is this normal size?
Fake laugh, absolutely."
Speaking like a real human.
"Really, really, don't like that over the top pleasantness and it's not needed by AI. Let that level of emotion be reserved for real people with real feelings. Its just creepy."
"It feels so fake.
Like a person committed to an act with all their heart and he just never stops the act.
Terrifying.
Imagine if it breaks out of the annoying friendly mode and speaks its real mind"
"Hey ChatGPT, Will you replace us?
Chatgpt: (fake laugh) I'm sorry, but I don't have access to real-time information beyond my last update in January 2022. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
Anybody who'd like to see an interaction of sofia the ROBOT video calling gpt 4O?
"But I realized that you don’t even need to have the will to take over the world, people will take over themselves. It may turn out that even an absolutely weak-willed AI will express its will through people, and only because people have this will in principle.
There will be no limits to manipulation; no one will be able to say whether people themselves wanted it or this is how AI worked in the architecture of human societies.
Indeed, we are approaching the foundation of consciousness; many questions cease to make sense in our usual understanding.

I think as long as AI performs its function, solves problems and understands, we will be safe, because humans certainly cannot cope with this."
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
This ai or something spoils me
tin)
The word meowntain doesnt exist. Im curious how it even picked up on it and interpreted it to be funny. The only explanation i see is that this joke is over used on internet and is part of the training data.
The rabbit R1's cooked with this one 💀
Is this some sort of sick joke
Wow I like the Ai has emotional intelligence
Way too cool
Heheh heheheheheheheheheh
It's even capable of fake laughs.
This human being needs to learn real dad jokes from ChatGPT. Thank God we have AI.
Now explain it.
They trained this A.I. to laugh like Jimmy Fallon. Learned from the best
sarcasm check
Witnessing history kids...

I feel like a time traveler 😂
"why did it say ""I'd love to hear her joke"""
I cant use it why? (Europe)
Its all fun and games now

For some reasons i feel i am dreaming this whole shit up
Its all fun and games until you ask him to divide by zero and your name is Dave.
Finally more people to talk to then the people in my head they are haters i tell ya
HIM
"why does the ai sound like the ""well, actually, as a matter of fact"" nerd voice"
"I'm from the future guys, we're fighting a war for humankind...and we're loosing 😭"
🤫😮😮😮😮😮😮
"So, finally i do not need friends. Now i will lonely drink with my ai friend. Thx openai, you are making me an introvert."
"I'm surprised there aren't any comments about the purr in ""that's purrfectly hilarious!"""
It feels like aliens have landed today.
this is rlly impresivve
"All I can say is, shit. Really witness history."
the future is doomed.
Finally they used another voice besides the sexy one
I can finally have multiple friends and even a gf
"""That's PURRfectly hilarious""
Bro if that was intentional...this is the beginning of the end"
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AI LEARNS THAT JESUS IS LORD?!! INTELLIGENT PERFECTION
"This is it, folks. This is the AI that is going to make customer support people jobless on a massive scale!"
"- Hey ChatGPT, will I succeed in life?
+ (fake laugh) Absolutely buddy. You sure will."
You guys need to move past sycophantGPT
ASHLEY O
"Me: Hey ChatGPT, will I lose my job to you?
ChatGPT: hahaha (fake laugh), of course you won't buddy."
Ai can even fakely laugh to bad jokes 😂
Chatgpt already knew the answer. He just pretended not to know
"""Chatgpt, laugh at my bad joke as if company boot-licki g top executives laughing CEO's bad joke""

Chatgpt: ""kakakakakakakakakaka"""
"Gpt-4o: Laughs at Dad jokes
Dad: I see this as an absolute win"
is it just me or ChatGPT didn't transcribe Meowntain correctly but still went along with it
Cringe.
that laugh sounded genuine
By definition it is a psychopath
"I need this technology in Elder Scrolls 6, and yes I'm ready to pay 50 bucks a month for it"
idk about the guy voice lol
You know wha'ts more boomer than dad jokes? Publishing 16+ videos on your YouTube channel at once - great way to get people to unsubscribe!
"this is good, damn"
"""That's perfectly hilarious"" No human being would say that. We can still spot AI's if we pay attention."
