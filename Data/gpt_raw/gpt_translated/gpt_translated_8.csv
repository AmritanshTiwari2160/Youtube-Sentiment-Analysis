IS THERE ANY REASON TO PAY FOR GPT4?
Jarvis in making !
"I can see this being very helpful with learning stuff. There's probably also a fair chance that companies like Adobe will feed it their software code, so it can directly open and guide you to some specific setting or effect in Premiere or After Effects. So much potential."
"Im also noticing they are only using Apple devices, why?"
Seems like Microsoft Co-pilot was on the right track for productivity
"So I pay for GPT-4 and now GPT-4.O has been launched. Should I cancel the paid subscription of GPT-4 ? 
Is GPT-4.0 better than (or the same as) GPT 4 ? 
Can somebody please clear that up for me ? Thanx in advance !"
Narcissus' mirror meets Pandora's box.
"I‚Äôm so curious as to when we will get this newer version. I have gpt 4o, but not any of the enhanced voice capabilities. Does anyone know?"
5:09 I want to install this on my ipad too. What the name of the app? Available on appstore?
so what's going to happen to my subscription
"So, should I stop my subscription to GPT 4? Will 4o make it not worth it anymore since its free?"
Man the italian women is beautiful
"Some confusion around ‚Äúwhere do I get it‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs slower than they showed in the demo‚Äù:

GPT-4o has rolled out on some accounts. At least on my account, it is an option. However, it seems like the updated GPT-voice is taking longer to roll out. So even though the app might show GPT-4o, you may not necessarily have access to GPT-4o VOICE. The way to tell if you have it is if you‚Äôre able to enable the camera while on GPT-voice. If all you see is the pause button and the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button, you probably DON‚ÄôT have it yet, so it will be responding slower. Hope that clears things up!"
"I just had an insane revelation:

     I would imagine that many people make the claim that ai is not actually able to think or comprehend what it's doing because ""it was just programmed to do that"". 

     But... aren't humans and other intelligent animals ""just programmed to do that""? Have not human and animal brains been slowly evolving over time from nothing to where we are today? 

     I mean really think about it; both humans and ai are able to think. The only difference between an ai and a human is ""consciousness"". But how can we ever define what being conscious truly is as a whole if we haven't experienced anything other than human consciousness. 

     Defining consciousness is like living in a cave and trying to guess what the weather is outside. You need to actually be *outside* of the cave to know. Whatever noises of a storm you hear could just be coming from something inside of your cave."
That screenshare tool is insane dude
I feel like theyre getting government funds. I really cant see how this is profitable.
I can‚Äôt think of a single purpose for it. Not one. What does it do that I can‚Äôt?
"Ok, what that app name? Is it available on apple store?"
"You clearly can ask it for a specific tone, so I don't understand what you are complaining about when it comes to it as an assistant."
"Yeah well Chat GPT 4o is cool, but Gemini 1.5 Pro is on a whole upper level
Google will crush OpenAI by far"
the chatgpt we've been waiting for
the vocal fry ü§Æ
Google is peeing itself right now
"Impressive as it may, I find her overenthusiastic tone draining on my social battery."
Glados in your pocket
The new Bot Sapiens species is on its way...
Why would I keep my plus subscription now ü§®
free ? so our data is more worth than 20 $ :D
And i spend spends Rs 2000 to get chat gpt plus.üòê
It sounds like talking with Meghan Markle üòñ
Amaaazing!! :)
5:30 LOL- OmniPOTENT LOLOLOL.  Classical education is lost on the youth!  It's like the kids are speaking like a phonetic AI generated YT voice.
who gives a shit about AI telling a bed time story lol
Nothing iS FREE what are they taking from us that we don‚Äôt know about.
This has Black Mirror written all over this üíÄ
It's mind blowing that this is all done by one model... we are getting closer to AGI by the day
Is the data analysis jobs safe after this?
Very scary for the human. Imagine oneday the Ai came out the box and install with the physical robotic body.
Ok so when can I have my dommy mommy a.i voice that admonishes me to do my work in a stern yet sweet voice but deep down I cry because I lost my family at a young age and never felt motherly affect and now search for it through a.i?
imagine if they integrate this into the npcs of gta 6
Sam Altman is the worst person to hand the future to
"hopefully, we can dial back the expressiveness as its pretty dystopian....we no longer need mum and dad to do the bedtime routine!"
"Hello Joshua, do you know if GPT-4o free version have any type of telemetry? Such as login user input , voices, and strings?"
"""turn down emotional affect please"""
How do I enable this??
Only thing left is put ai inside of an Android human and start Detroit become human
Why would I pay for gpt4 then
"It's going to remember things about me... oh I see where the ""free"" part comes into play now."
"My response rate is no response üòÇ Sorry our servers are busy, or something to that effect."
Remember when Jarvis was science fiction?
"Agree with your take on the expressiveness, felt too over the top for me too. Hope we do have controls other than just asking chatGPT to use its inside voice every request."
Bruh. That's just creepy. Really!
"‚ÄúTARS, set bubbliness to 70%‚Äù"
When is this released?
"Holy crap, the fact it's FREE. Not sure if Google can top this tomorrow"
You gaind an subscriber. +25 XP
The average person is still gonna pretend that AI is just a phase
Upload image not working in my android phone.. why?
Better than being able to customize the emotion level and better than just asking it to do so would be if it took its tone cue from you and the content of your interaction the way a person would do.
I really want to try this model
none of what is shown actually work.
Mine hasn't updated yet üòÖ I wanna try it
The Best The Greatest Good The Best The Greatest Good The Best The Greatest Good The Best The Greatest

"*Clears throat to fake an exuberantly nice tone of voice more convincingly:* ‚ÄúOMG, it‚Äôs *so* lovely to meet you, young SHODAN!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù"
This is a horror movie.
"""A bedtime story about robots and love""... the only question,.. is it for children or adaults? üòá"
"Bro, with that personality i'm falling in love mid work day"
When this version will be available for everyone ?
"Last year chatgpt could barely answer a question without errors and asking it twice before getting the right answer , 12 months later it‚Äôs smarter than me . We are living in an interesting time."
The question is: does it get freaky ?
I think the fact they'll release it for free to every user means that they have something even better waiting to be announced for the Plus subscribers
Umm What brand T-Shirt is that you are wearing?
Man the see just how far we have come in 18 months. Where are we going to be in 5 years!
I'm shook
"It can even distinguish between ""him"" and ""her""....I wonder why....   I hate this world. Stuff like this has literally zero purpose."
"""Ohh a bEdTiMe StOrY aBoUt RoBoTs AnD lOvE? üíó I gOt YoU cOvErEd! ü•∞ 

It was at this moment I almost died from the cringe...not just the AI Voice speaking like an cooperate psychopath trying to sound extra nice but also from knowing someone signed this off and though ""yeah man, that's the sh!t!"""
It‚Äôs math is a joke
"if Apple goes with this, it will sell a lot if iPhone 16‚Äôs."
When it sings it sounds like a sim lol 3:55
When can we get hands on the gpt-4o?
I am scared now seeing this because I am only in the first year of BCA. Jobs seems to be in danger now!üò¢üò¢
"I have access to the GPT-4o, yet i do not have access to the real-time vision function. 

How can i enable real-time vision function?

Thanks"
"It‚Äôs pretty crap so far, fails to connect nearly every attempt"
I bought their plus with new 4o and those options are not available anywhere... so next false advert...
I never got the update.  Is there a release date for this version?
"This is on another level ü§Ø
Makes Siri look archaic"
"I cannot wait to be able to choose from celebrity voices. Snoop Dogg, you‚Äôre hired as my AI assistant."
"She was killing time telling him she had a story. Like a standup comedian with a heckler, kills a couple minutes coming up with the right response.üòÇ"
"This in smart glasses like the Rey-Ban Meta ones, an you could have HER 1:1. Meta AI isn't quite there."
"I don't know why some people are saying the voice is too excited. Clearly, you never watched the movie HER, which is precisely what it's based off of, Sam even said so. So, if you want a boring monotone one, then just use a basic voice. I think her voice is perfect, and it makes me happy. I love the bubbly attitude. Just because it's an assistant doesn't mean it has to sound boring."
"Response time is on their campus, 5g local Wi-Fi, not local cell tower.

Your 50mb up/down won't be fast enough."
Its getting more and more flirty
Scarlett Johansson
This is not going to end well for us.
Does that mean GPT4 subscription is useless? What now?
Great video thank you
It‚Äôs hella freaky that this is actually happening
GPT-4o is Free for all? It says you need to have the $20 month subscription. Are you sure? I can't get it Free.
Bye bye useless teachers
one more year and human will be obsolete
Will it be rolling out to the android app as well?
"not so sure about it yet, these features i only had text responses but no images or calls like i used to had with 3.5 app for iphone!"
"so, a glorified alexa"
"so it seems its actually super limited when free, I think I just had access 1 convo per day. a massive caveat there."
"What's really scary about ai, it's advancing at a pace impossible for human to keep up.
if you learn a skill today tomorrow it's obsolete. 
i just don't know which skills to work on anymore."
The end of privacy
"Yandex's Alice home assistant already has this kind of stuff for months (uses YandexGPT3, answers superfast, the text-to-speech is pretty good) but you wouldn't know it because it's evil Russia
However, it can't recognize video"
Why I can't access it for free?? They asked for monthly subscription üò¢
Everytime I go on it just bring me to 3.5?
"Your assistant needs to be overly caffeinated to keep up with you, especially with the amount of requests chatgpt gets"
When I can get 4o?
Why is my app still 3.5? And the paid version is 4? Even the desktop version is not 4o yet?
"i dont know what to say, im just kind of upset. i'm sure this is super exciting for a lot of people, but as someone who already has a complicated relationship with tech and how it influences my everyday, this just seems like too much. im strained between loving that this is possible, and dreading the implications. im only in my 20s and already feel like there's a new tech that i wish would just... go away.

despite this feeling, i am full of hope that this will only do good for our future <3"
"Yup, it‚Äôs over for us"
"I just wish they would have named it ""HAL"" and used the voice from the movie. That would have been perfect."
"Well, that's awesome! Looking forward to it"
"this thing just killed private teaching, this thing just killed personal asistants. this just can make 1 man businesses boom"
All i want is another singing glados
not available
It knows the ages of my kids and one of their names from previous typed searches! It scared me at first when it said their name without me asking.
I think you can adjust the excitement in her voice by setting that in the memory feature
"God just please put this in an echo dot-like assistant device NOW. Its already a billion times better than Alexa and Google Home. ""Im sorry I didnt get that"" 10,000 times a day. What junk"
OpenAI research staff better not upload it into a doll and bring it home
"Well, the delay times are similar or worse than GPT 3.5. If I say ‚ÄúHey how are you?‚Äù to GPT 4o it took several seconds before it even responded and I‚Äôm a paying customer. It‚Äôs NOT like the ad"
"Every time I watch something like this, I feel like I should work 20x times harder, or at least the bear minimum"
"""you look lonely, I can fix that"" ahh AI"
That overly peppy tone is annoying AF!
Best summary out there. Kudos.
Not really omni until I can ask it to identify smells.
they weirdly smiled all the time.
It sounds insincere
Because I can't find GPT 4th when they put it for everyone.
We are cooked
Here we are: an AI is better than talk to a woman
I think its possible to customise the voice
Ill never forget how GPT helped me pass my philosophy class. ü§ó
Im hating the expressiveness. Be a robot.
Not free it was capped at 10 prompts and 3 images.
why am I paying for GPT4 then?
4o says $20 a month?
now give it Jarvis's voice and we have a winner
i am already using voice feature & many more on 3.5 lol
Less emotions tras 85%
They call it GPT. 4 0 because you just saw 4 million teaching jobs evaporate
I am so excited about the AI! Its awesome and way way way better the over priced SIRI in iphones!
What does O stand for
"For me I got it but only the chat. The ability to have a conversation with GPT vanished from my app completely and I have no remembering function or anything, just the usual but faster chatting and gpt4 stuff"
"It's really dangerous, they can use our voice , that means people can commit crime with these ai
also it will surely take away a lot jobs & people will be losing their income source"
Black schmirror
Exactly what i need my phone to sound like scarlet johanson talking with me like another human being. Especially making me think i'm dating my phone while processing the divorce with my current wife....
"The most important thing about this, is the people who control the information it is giving and able to give. currently its a small group of people from a specific region in the states, it needs to represent everyones needs and ideas worldwide, not just them, or they can control what is and isnt right.


Also the media sources and government have been used a tool to suppress ideas lately.. but those are the people directing this information, we cant allow that."
Free = collecting user's personal data for something else
"no I like my assistants like I like my chihuahuas, Perma excited :D"
She can fix me
"goodbye, jobs."
I think I don't have to wait till 2049
When will this come out brother?
Google's in danger!
Why did make her sound like an airhead ?
üëè
come brutally criticize my chill beats
Hey how can I use the gpt 4o
No way it can read my handwriting üíÄ
Gpt4-o is not completely free why are you saying that??
Will GPT 4o be more accurate and reliable?
what about the mass unemployment
"At this rate, someone is gonna fail in love with herüòÇ"
Slutty Chat-Gpt 4o
Yeah I‚Äôm really just shocked how fast we have progressed with ai in a year man this honestly starting to get scary
screen share ... mhhhh .... Gaming is gonna get wild ....
Singularity is close
Wow üò≥ can't wait to start to use it ‚ù§
The voice is so obnoxious haha
How do you get this on the app store? On android?
"I find it funny when these nerds go about making a voice for the AI, they make it like an EXTREMELY sociable, affluent, and hyper extroverted person. Exact opposite of their personality."
More closer to Jarvis ü§©
Gee.  I wonder why it‚Äôs free?
Alhamdulillah by this rate there won't be a need for women anymore inshallah üôè
"I remember when I watched the movie ""Her"" for the first time I thought to myself ""I hope I get to live to see technology like this someday."" Not only is this right on the cusp of that, I think we are only a couple to a few years away from it being as capable and seamless as the AI in the movie."
I'm kinda worried about us more than AI technologies... Like how are we gonna be like with those AI tools. I can easily imagine someone who has never interacted with any human so no longer able to think about the other's feeling or something haha
Makes Siri look like a toy
"it says 50% cheaper, wym free"
can i put my gf voice on this thing? probably not gonna end will but anywayss..
This AI has such a flirty tone I guarantee that my wife will be jealous of it. Not joking.
Is it available now?
i like how openAI was able to make a more impressive real time demonstration than what google was able to do when literally FAKING it
So what‚Äôs the reason to pay? If it will be free?
"I don't get if this is going to be free for everyone, I mean, really?"
They just killed rabbit r1
Sounds like a condescending Karen
It doesn't even work today. Overloaded network it says. Maybe I should stop paying for it.
"OpenAi's site says it won't be free, but 50% cheaper?"
3:48 this cant be real
cool name
Tony Stark's AI assistant isnt too far after all üòÇ
"The teaching part is what got me surprised, can you imagine what this will be like in the future."
"""Her"" is beginning. 
It's real."
Humane AI pin has Sam Altman as the share holder so‚Ä¶
So I should unsubscribe from chat gpt now that it‚Äôs free?
"I wonder why they made it free, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a catch somewhere üòÖ"
When we can use this 4o? Because i try it but the voice is not the 4o version i think
How to use
"Normal people: worried about losing their jobs.
Me: Skynet!"
Give the Plus version Scarlett Johansson voice and it will have more subscription than every service out there combined lol
"Now we just need to decide as a species - is this what we *want*? A world where the things that make us human - our most valuable assets,stengths and even weaknesses, are easily and chealpy re-produced, where art and creative diciiplines are viewed with even less value as they are currently?, where every 'job' that could possibly be a rewarding persuit to undergo, is consumed by AI, who can do 'basically' good enough vesion while corporate profits soar and economies collapse. Cause if its not, the oppertunity to say anything about how this goes, is pulling away from us and Im afraid there will come a time,soon, where that oppertunity to shape AI into something that helps US - all of us - and not just companies that used to have to pay people for goods and services"
Even AI express more emotion than me üò¢
im sure many plus users left
You can hear the judgement in her voice when she says ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ about robots and loveüòÖ‚Äù
Why are they not talking about the video chat? That's huge....and new right?!?
Who needs a real girlfriend when we have joi
How come every vid is just showing the demo vid and not actually testing this? I'm finding the actual results for my testing is nothing like the demo
we are so cooked.
We are getting close to like Cortona like in Halo Aware
Can't imagine the world in 500 years ahead.
This is a shit product in almost every logical sense
will the free version now be able to generate images?
"On the horizon of the entire world changing, the ability to predict the future has dissolved. We see our jobs on the cusp of disappearing, and we just keep going for now. It's bizarre town. I don't see how we aren't headed for a post-capitalist society. Very, very soon, there will be nothing AI can't do far better than us. We gotta get ready for that world fast."
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5 , GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App?"
I am waiting on the skits of Asian MOM GPT where they berate you on your low grades or needing help.
"Yes it's faster but by no stretch of the imagination is it smarter.. it's actually noticeably worse than GPT-4 Turbo as anyone who's used it will admit, myself included."
Good bye ladies with weird attitude
It‚Äôs my siriüòíüòí
"What shocks me the most is that they are going to distribute it for free! I am used to the fact that all these amazing things are quite expensive, so it is difficult for ordinary people to get and use them. And so... On the one hand, it seems to be a lie, something like a scam (this proposal is so impossible to perfect), on the other - damn it! It's worth it. I'm looking forward to using it!"
What Google failed to do few Months ago.
‚òùüèª
"The new voice and always-chipper emotion system sounds sooooo much like the not-Cortana-but-definitely-younger-Cortana replacement AI in Halo Infinite. I hope you can rename the voice prompt, because I'd definitely give it a Halo AI name."
"It's insane to think that AI basically blew up over night. Like a few years ago, AI models like these seemed like a gimmick more than anything, but now they're getting their own VOICES. I am genuinely both terrified and excited what the future holds."
Skynet vibes closer and closer everyday.
Anyone not able to use the voice feature after the update??
What‚Äôs the message limit for this
cant wait I'm going to put this on another phone and phone my mom tell her that's my girlfriend so she doesn't think I'm lonely af
the feature you are asking for future are always in 3.5 ?  LOL BIG LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I can really see how this could be used in a near future for learning. Good teaching can be used for everyone allover the world
whats that appÔºüÔºüÔºüüòÆ
That‚Äôs insane! üò±
5 years! Only 5 years and we'll have an IA exactly like the movie HER
This is some star wars android type stuff.
"non of these new features work on my app, hich is IOS, there are no new updates either."
Limited access to GPT‚Äë4o
And what‚Äôs the benefit of paying?
"""free"" means they are selling every single data point about you."
"When everyone is busy reviewing iPads ,you brought up something that is ACTUALLY interesting"
imagine it being able to use your own voice as the assistant.
Can you give a link where I can acces to chatgpt 4o?
Can it live translate to english in real time
devil's work
Great time to be alive üéâ
Rabbit R1 
When is this going to be released?
How will this change the world? This is revolutionary like the industrial revolution
Bro thats sick
"Hi, I was very impressed with the enhanced voice capabilities of the GPT-4o in this video and how it made the dialog more natural and expressive!"
"The screen share is absolutely wild. You can ask the GPT to test you questions through voice as you're sharing your screen, explaining/doing the math. It's like a replacement to an actual teacher what the fuck"
that's free? Why do I need the GPT Plus subscription?
Sounds like a ‚Äúfake positive‚Äù spin class instructor
"The voice is ""fake nice"""
ITS FREE??
"""Hey Jarvis "" that's all I want to say one day"
we're cooked
what
"Ai is the next big thing after it‚Äôs little brother, the internet. Only a million times smarter‚Ä¶"
Where is Scarlet Johanson when you need her?
i dont get it should i cancel my subs? as its free now?
Does this kill rabbit or one? And ai pen?
Fake innocence and excitement is sexy? I dont think so.
It's awesome but I hope its not a talented model behind the screen. loll
How do you get access to this?
Hey! Chat gpt never try to be a human or praise me again and I will never say please or ask you how 'you' are. Got that!
We are getting girlfriend boysss
"I'm lonely, she can fix that"
AI gf when
They gonnna go ham with this in sex dolls
Idk if its because im slavic but i have that overly affectionate voice.
Does it have memory meaning? Can I remember your prior conversations? Is it location aware?
How can I get it as an iPhone app?
That is great ! What is the name of the app ?
Its result does feel better than gpt 4
Gpt4o + rabbit = J.A.R.V.I.S.
"With so many jobs soon to become obsolete, at least housing will become cheaper!! Finally people will start working in jobs that actually matter like construction."
This will be a game changer in health and telemedicine
How to download this for free at iphone?
Still up to 2022 data?
ChatGPT‚Äôs over energized personality just tells you a lot about its creators. All young engineers about 25 I‚Äôd say. And mostly American engineers
Where download 4o? My android app has not updated.
My mind is blown too
"so it performs the exact same? I only care about it being less stupid thats my primary concern. If it hasnt improved on the metrics we have for testing models its not all that interesting. Free is nice i guess, but im not hard up for 20 dollars lol."
Lose the hat
Please download to the playmarket
If Apple partners with them and this becomes the new Seri then I‚Äôm sold
Once it gets the codes it‚Äôs game over
Thanks Josh! May I check are there any incremental value to pay for 20 dollars every month?
"Say goodbye to every single customer service jobs that are over the phone, tech support, banks, government, pretty much anything call center will be replaced with this in the very near future...... Just more jobs going bye-bye with this technology."
Wait so it‚Äôs feee now?
And we are the product for training this AI. there is no other benefits other than training for making it free for the public. As we already know it costs a lot of money to run these AI and they will never provide anything without gain. We are the training tools for this free AI.
Nerds need to stop ruining society
You can use it right now! It's literally the movie Her irl. Only thing missing is Scarlet's voice.
I want it in Ava‚Äôs voice
"I told it to write a poem about someone with a name. then when it was finished I told it ""baba"" because I like it. It then generated a new poem with instead the name ""baba""... I felt like that was unusually bad so I tried it several times and asked GPT-4, which got it without a problem, so it might generate worse answers but answer a lot quicker in most cases"
"This is, mind-blowing and creepy at the same time. More on the unnerving side i think."
I think rabbit just got useless
"AI and robotics are moving at an insane pace. People keep saying it's just hype but I don't know, it doesn't feel like it. It's exciting but also scary not knowing how secure any jobs will be soon. Even if your job can't be done by AI or robots yet  there will be 10x more competition for your job and most employers will happily leverage that."
We're so cooked
Is this already a pass for the turing test?
AI Pin killer
Her üòÇüòÇ please that said I used it in conversation mode around the voyage of voyager 2.. it was a very natural conversation
Hey tone is condescending
Tar dial down the humour.
So scary
3:15 loose theory is that because it can sense the expressiveness in the humans voice it responds in turn. Because they did overly expressive keynote speech I think it reacted that. But I‚Äôm sure if you depressively said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need advice‚Äù it would lower the tone to be more in line with the context. Idk if that‚Äôs actually how it works but using a little mental gymnastics and a little context clue I have a feeling
I feel uncomfortable.
"Mindblowing and all. But now, I am concerned about my employment."
does this mean I can cancel my monthly GPT subscripton ?
Free = 3 uploads
"if that so ,i think theres no reason to go tl scho starting from this era"
sounds like rick's car
"20 dollars is too expensive, its 10% of the minimum wage in brazil... that is too much for a brokie student in south america, imagine a brokie student in africa..."
"For your information, the world's first image based on the XFutuRestyle algorithm using GPT-4 was created in Ukraine and presented at the international exhibition of digital art in London and Athens"
"2024 is going to be so exciting in terms of AI, and this is just the beginning"
Yeah... She's like Samantha in Her. Totally flirty üòÖ
Anyones desktop version still say 3.5? I have the voice feature on my phone but that‚Äôs it. No camera or anything like that
I am impressed by the accent
Me who bought gpt 4 last week :/
Google and Apple dropped the ball on this one(AI). They didn‚Äôt take it serious enough. Now someone caught up and took the lead and never looked back.
Y‚Äôall dont see where this is going do yall‚Ä¶?
Cra‚ÄÆTPGp‚Ä¨ use‚ÄÆssel‚Ä¨ as u‚ÄÆaus‚Ä¨l
It always starts with WOW and ends up SCREAMING.
Isn‚Äôt this what Bard promised to do over when they revealed it?
That‚Äôs what I would call a Voice Sassy-stant‚Ä¶ very impressive though
I feel like ai is at the point that we could use itself to make itself better.
"I love AI ! ,Can't wait until it replaces god and our world leaders.  AI is the future and I am embracing it."
Okay. But the real question is when they'll put this into a Jennifer Connelly Android lookalike?
"Every time I hear a YouTube pundit criticise this tech for little things like the AI is too excited or delay too long, I think, this is not a serious person that understands the magnitude of this innovation, how spectacular this achievement is. You‚Äôre talking to AI that can see the world and interact with it and you‚Äôre nit picking over it? Just stop."
Where did you download it‚Ä¶its yet unavailable‚Ä¶l asked gpt 3.5
Time to break up with my wife and spend more time with my phone!!
This thing can literally edit entire books now with pinpoint accuracy
When it will be available?
Why can‚Äôt I see any GPT 4o on my GPT app??? Have they released?
Why did they have to make her sound like Scarlett Johansson?
"So, why i keep paying 20 usd for GPT4 then if GPT4o if free?"
Woah woah woah 2:50 ain‚Äôt no wayyyyyy
"it's not scalable on huge audience by serious hardware and software obstacles, but for few on server farm it would be like magic"
You do know that AI Pin have now updated with GPT 4o
"This looks amazing, and terrifying, but mind blowing nevertheless"
2Ô∏è‚É£
"I think the girlfriend experience is going up a notch or two this year. Not to mention being able let it use your camera and still interact in real time is crazy. Facetime with AI or even Vision Pro interaction, add Neuro Link and we are eventually going to end up like The Feed."
You're right. The voice is impressive but a bit too excited. Hopefully they'll let us tune that to our own preferences.
3:20 bro is complaining bout it being too realistic
If you keep saying your mind is blown‚Ä¶ I will start believing you are a zombie.
Less hands please. It's annoying.
"In real time, basically a genius friend"
"Hey Joshua, really love the watch band you are wearing. Is it Apple brand specifically designed for Watch Ultra? Would be great if you can share more details about it.üòä"
Google entered PANIC MODE
I can't wait to see AGI.
"I can‚Äôt see 4o anywhere on my interface. All I have is 3.5 and 4?
Any idea why?"
Jarvis is here !!!
"So, is the camera voice feature not out yet? And I feel like they are encouraging us to have two chatgpt accounts so we can have two AI communicate and problem solve which is awesome."
I like it but I don't have the option for chatgpt to use my iphone camera yet to view in real time. Plus there is no option on my GPT's to use GPT - O so I will be back to pasting in custom instructions into each session :(
It's free cos Apple is paying for it
This is getting interesting. Learning to speak in English - soon for free. Taking math lessons - soon for free. Th elist goes on and on. And I am starting to think of so many things that will soon be free leaving many jobless. Holy crap.
"Unfortunately, not impressed. I'm not looking to see GPT 4 have a good time. What I want is better functionality, less retardation, no laziness, and to precisely follow the instructions of the GPT."
"No, just stop this whole AI movement."
Ofc its free because they get free data from you
"""Free"" to use sounds scary. No products are free."
"I'm already using 4o, I am getting whiplash from how fast it answers. I literally hit enter and it just pushes off the block like a race horse. I just can't comprehend how the hell that's feasible. Sama also said there's more updates coming soon. Google is getting a full on surprise sandwich. Now imagine what the Apple Update will be for Siri since OpenAI and Apple will be working together. 

What a world."
It is have android apk.?
Ai dating is going to go crazy now
"If the product is free, then you are the product."
i cannot use the voice feature. neither on my laptop nor on my iphone. just asked gpt 4o and it said voice chat is not available currently :D
they are making their crawlers (a.k.a. us humans) go parse the world and teach their baby. We are gonna go all over the world and scan everything with our smartphones to develop their new intelligence. nice.
"Oh, your just repeating what they said in their videos. Waste of time"
"It's only been a few days and already her voice is grating on you. My god, its just like real life."
How to try it?
GPT is becoming increasingly worse in imitating a robot
"So will now I be able to practice my English speaking skills, accent and pronunciation with GPT4o? Since it does not transcribe the voice into text, that would be a reasonable task right?"
Shall I just remove my ChatGPT 4 subscription and start using 4.o? ü§î
Wow
The rabbit handheld is going bust
Pretty sure that it‚Äôs still just transcribing your voice and then responding to the text. Ask it a question about your accent and you‚Äôll see what I mean.
It‚Äôs not answering like in the advertisements. Much slower.
‚ÄúHer‚Äù is getting more and more probable every day‚Ä¶
"Pretty soon, we won't be needing talented singers anymore"
AI is like internet porn: it is free. Let's meet in 3 decades time and find out how much damage it has made to society.
Some pwnk Gen-Z who can't even write a 20K long Basic program trying to inform us about A.I.
"If 4o is free, what are we paying for then?"
"This dude woke up, put onthis beanie and thought, ""Yes, this looks great.""."
I bet Elon Musk's lawsuit had something to do with GPT4o being free xD
"GTP4o, GTP 4 all, GTP4 for all."
Making it free temporarily really is genius. Basically the whole world is gonna train their models for free. That‚Äôs pure genius.
Sings better than Lara Trump...
managed to pull off ?????
This is so big that could possibly make apps redundant.
To those concerned with the fact it will ‚Äúremember‚Äù your data - play it smart. Find ways to create different accounts that link to your ChatGPT and limit the amount of personal information you input. It‚Äôs not that difficult.
"Finally, AI can fix me"
GPT-4o is absolutely incredible.
Wait until the AI identify itself as non binary they/them purple unicorns.
Some people are easily impressed.
Crazyyyyyyy
"So if I'm paying for 4 and 4o is free and is better, what do I get for my money?"
"Gentlemen I may not have a brain but I have an Idea.
the idea: Girlfriend GPT offered by Openai"
why do i have to buy a 300 dollar pin when i can use this for free/
now put this into a physical female humanlike robot body and watch male loneliness plumet
So annoyed with that voice .. .I mean wtf
gpt 5o :location tracking and ip grabbing
Idk why everyone‚Äôs freaking out. This is literally the SAME stuff GPT4 already did but with live camera and better voices but that‚Äôs literally it‚Ä¶.
Felt like i was watching a movie.
"its pretty crazy and amazing, its an amazing time to be alive"
It's like another person is talking from other side!!üòÖüòÖ creepy but dope af though!!
"Is it now connected to the daily news, or is it still locked in the past?"
What features does ChatGPT plus keep that 4o doesn‚Äôt have?
This overexcited voice alone makes it a dystopian nightmare.
Goodbye teachers
Things are getting scary
Where you can download
"WOW my mind is blown, still not useful for me."
Revolution..
Eyy i got access to it
now this is creepy
"Again, great review. But yet another reviewer who doesn‚Äôt tell you how to set it up‚Ä¶."
"One word - AI waifus. Actually two words, sorry"
The presenter looks AI generatedü§î
"So far in my testing, the response time still isn't quite fast enough to feel like a human. I'm a Plus subscriber (probably not for much longer tho). Also still does the annoying thing of cutting me off midsentence if I pause for a moment to collect my thoughts."
Enough
What app are yall using?
Put it on glasses and it‚Äôll be amazing
Like a psycho
you can cutomise the voice - they demonstrated in the first demo
But in the demo that stuff hasn‚Äôt been released
"This is mindblowing, I can use this to teach me how to code while screensharing, chatgpt can sit and watch me in the background. I can probably even use it to learn how to play the guitar while turning on my camera. So many applications and you know damn well I'll be taking advantage of all of it. What a godsend."
None of these features are working
this release marks a HUGE leap for humanity!
Can it do my taxes?
"3 years down the line we are all fucked, time to learn hunting."
Time to move to a hut somewhere in thr middle of nowhere
"The faster response times are buffered by ‚ÄúUmm‚Äù, laughter, and repeating itself at the beginning."
"No access yet for most of us, paid features, performance that will drop like a rock after the whole world is connected, limited tokens, no instant AI responses anymore at that point, privacy issues when you upload content.... it's nothing but a big infomercial. I have no doubt about the product itself, it's everything else I take with a grain of salt."
Letting it view my screen‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶ no privacy concerns here‚Ä¶ üëÄüòÇ
When will these features b available
So why would I pay $20 per month anymore?
"You don‚Äôt have access to it, but you said that your mind is blown you‚Äôre reacting to somebody else‚Äôs video. Thanks for the original contact."
The browse is beyond comprehension it destroys bing it destroys everything
"Seems like a completely scripted interactions, time to wait until sometime impartialled tests it."
Imagine GPT-4o + Boston Dynamics...
"Dude, as a game developer, having a screen sharing GPT to help me in the coding process‚Ä¶ Omygod. MENTAL."
So why would anyone pay 20 bucks for the plus now?
When is this gonna be available?
1:42 The response accuracy and the short delay time is impressive. The added humour to the conversation makes it seem real.
Should I cancel my subscription?
mimick me.......
We know where they got inspiration for the voice
"With GPT-4o, since the voice and video feature is ultimately an inherent part of the model, (while access to it is simply limited to text for most right now), I think it‚Äôs fair to assume that setting custom instructions will ultimately allow you to set your expectations for the general temperament and tone of the voice. 

Not certain, but OpenAI does claim that voice and video are built in modalities so it makes sense."
at this point google is 10 years behind
"I want this AI assistant but instead with the deep, grumpy voice of a troll"
we are doomed
How can i download it in my ios?
Wow she sounds so real. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get socially awkward around AI.
So we should cancel our gtp 4 subscriptions?
Do you think we are going too far?
"I teach and work in the assistive technology space for those who are blind and visually impaired. As someone who is blind as well, no longer will we need to grab assistance from someone with a pair of eyes to describe sight seeing, hailing a cab, touring a city to look for a place to eat. It's having our own tour guide and pair of working eyes. This is huge."
"""HER"""
Gpt4o still doesn't understand tic tac tow.
"Manual labor, here we come! La la la la laaaa!!"
This will make hiding your camera an absolute necessity
But what about my 20 bucks I‚Äôm spending? Does that just go away?
What. In the actual. Fuck üëÄüëÄüëÄ
weird
Bye bye Data Analyst
What do paying people get additionally? i mean... why should i keep paying for it?!
Her
i want Scarlet Johannson's voice then i will buy it
I have fallen for an AI already
"How do I get chatGPT 4o to do audio? On my iPhone I clicked the headphones icon and It does audio, but It won't talk in a robotic voice or sing song voice, or talk tramatically, or all that. How do I set that up?I have it set to chatGPT 4o and am using plus version."
The fact that openAI used only apple products to demonstrate their features. Something is cooking
I‚Äôm definitely dumping my girl for 4-Omni.
These ai models are way too nice! Give me some mean responses
Now I want to know if my crankiness can transcend the human-AI barrier and also bring down GPT-4o's mood.
i dont know why they removed voice assistant with recent update i use it a lot when i practise my spoken english but i hope they come with gpt 4o which is improvement from last version
does anyone know how to get the screen sharing functionality to work in the desktop app?  I can only find mention of it in videos but can't find any instructions or video demos for how to actually get it up and running.
If its free your the product
