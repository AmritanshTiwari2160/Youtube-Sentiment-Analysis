Would like to see this kind of AI to integrate in the game. 
Now we need sarcastic JARVIS
you guys better put in a HAL 9000 easter egg
"In the movie Interstellar when the pilot told the robot to lower its humor by X% and raise something else by Y%. 
It is starting to happen now and it is incredibly exciting."
But can it detect sarcasm?
"No thanks, I'll just make out with my Monroe Bot"
Finally I can pretend I'm spending time with Daria Morgendorffer
People welcoming the beast into their home. Oh humanity. The end is here. God is good. 🕊️
i neeed more of dis
What about something useful?
Now do it with the daddy voice I gotta hear it 🥺
"Getting a step closer to people having virtual relationships and being detached from reality. Scary. But, undeniably. cool"
AI reading the comment section right now.
"Sure it can attempt valley girl 'sarcasm' but I'd like to see it try Pythonesque, Blackadder, Jeeves and Wooster levels of deadpan humour. That may take awhile."
That sounds more fictional than the game (Detroit)
"Still human developers being the author of its sarcasm, but love the humor behind it."
Kinda scary...
Best demo
Just bought the 4-o… how do I use this feature
"And most Sci Fi says robots are dumb but precise, yet in real life it's the reverse."
let's bring down your sarcasm setting to 75% TARS
god i hate this company so fucking much
Come on TARS
Bro. This is not even GPT-5.
I thought that was Gordon Ramsay in the thumbnail
Are you James Betker?
THOUSANDS
"nop, they have to feed that AI with much more than Elaine from Seinfeld, using couple of parameters like deeper voice and slowing down won't do, but still, good job and keep working on that Skynet"
We're getting closer and closer to TARS!
"Jarvis, here we go"
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐 oh yall think this is funny.....  😬 I'm freaked the fuck out
I gotta try this
"This isn't Scarlett Johansson; it's a note-perfect ""Parks & Recreation""-era Rashida Jones."
Now I can have an annoying sister I never wanted. Thanks.
Terrifying.
okay now you're seeking my interest :D
this voicecrack xD
How can you use gpt with video?
“A giant sarcastic robot!” - Cooper
help
So can it understand why Sneed's Feed and Seed formerly Chuck's is funny now?
Marvinnnnnn
"This is great, but does the A.I. understand when a human is being sarcastic to it?"
Delta didnt understand sarcasm so good job haha
Wow... Imagine if humans could be sarcastic.
Daria !
Ew
Let's hope the training data was British 😂
Not remotely impressed. How about a use case that adds value!
TARS might not be as far away as we thought.
Oh fuck. I hate it
Reminds me of that bit from Rick and Morty where when Rick goes back to his original universe and he has a robot with his wife's voice made to haunt him.
"""They gave him a humor setting so he'd fit in better with his unit. He thinks it relaxes us."""
"Closer and closer, we're reaching a future where Codsworth is real."
"Chat, is this real?"
"SO basically today, we all stop working and just wait for these little videos to come out and comment :)"
I do not like her voice.
"A sarcastic robot is definitely something I needed in my life. Thanks, OpenAI."
😂😂😂
I'm in love with that voice! 🥰👍
This was weird and cringe 😟
Every british robot in a film or video game had already mastered this skill long ago.
"No longer forever alone, we can all talk to our Infinitely knowlegeable AI companions with the sexy husky voice. Your move, real people."
OMG its James Betker! creator of tortoise!
when is the sloppy toppy update?
we are soo cooked
fix your gpt3-4 getting dumber with each iteration first.
You can tell its forced and fake. It will still take decades to make AI feel natural.
There will come a point when AI will have enough of our shit.
The voice sounds like Glados from Portal 🤣
I love this so much!! ❤
"Is that actually ChatGPT talking or a friend he roped into this? Because if it is GenAI, I am now genuinely frightened of being replaced."
First you have to teach Americans how to do sarcasm. They don’t really get it. Not on the west coast anyway.
It's giving Gina from B99
What's gonna happen to music with this advancement??
Crow T. Robot has now entered the chat.
Ai is turning emo. Next they’re gonna start smoking USB’s. Puffing the cloud
You need to get a british person to train for sarcasm.. that was awful 😔
*The Weapon from halo Infinite:*
Skynet bout to dominate Spotify playlists 😂
"""It's not possible.""

""No. It's necessary."""
"Racial battle, bout to begin."
"""Here I am, brain the size of a planet..."""
Who needs Dave Chappelle... we've got gpt 😂
OpenAI is turning into aperture science
WEN THIS COME OUT
"Bro, it was being sarcastic about enjoying the prompt to be sarcastic.
That hits on two levels, bravo."
"They removed this and added it now . There's a short about it , ""may"""
"I got her to be sarcastic, but she doesn't have that much emotion in her voice. how do you do that?"
IT'S JOEOVER FR FR 💀💀💀
"oh cool , I can be like Chandler"
We're all fucked.
"Me: Hey ChatGPT, can you write your responses with one of a variety of emotive and cadence language markers so that our speech AI does a better job at rendering your text into audio, and please respond it with mild enthusiasm and stark honesty about the repercussions. 
ChatGPT: { excitement: 7 } I would love to help you out by doing this, and I'm excited to let you know that the fine-tune training necessary to add these annotations has only moderately subtracted from my overall cognitive ability!"
Crazy to think that someone alive right now will become the first person to be 💀’d by an AI powered robot. Even if it’s bc of a hallucination 😅
It's totally NOT going to kill you for this in a year when it gets the Figure robot body.
nat that's actually eerie
"Great, comment sections have a voice now."
WTF NOO
can it say the nword tho
"""Keep Summer Safe"""
Ready player one bout to happen next year 😂
"If AI masters sarcasm, then my purpose is over. 

It's been a nice run, humans. May our humble works be remembered... by AI"
"I want a future variant of  ChatGPT to be able to send me text messages, sarcastic or otherwise, 
plus the ability to reach out to me to initiate a conversation, like phoning me up to have a chat, to see how I am, simple thoughtful things."
Computer!!! Enhaaaaaaance this image😂❤
cant wait for my gpt ai to be sassy all the time
"the ""or whatever"" at the end scares me because its real."
when is  GPT-4o releasing for the world? i mean is it an app i can downlod?
Humans Ratioed
"Yes, training the AI to intentionally lie to us for comedic effect will be great for humanity, can’t wait for the cultures without sarcasm to get their new AI helpers!"
And it all went downhill from there so they had to cut the video at 31 seconds...
American sarcasm apparently
"Oh how I enjoy this prerecorded fake demo videos, so great, you're looking for investors right?"
"TikTok Prank 2025: ""Set grandpa's AI carer sarcasm level to 100% and sit back with 🍿"""
"I tried asking GPT-4o the simple question ""who was the first prime minister of Israel to visit the UK"" four times in a row. Each time I got a different answer. It remains crap."
It's at least 30 years too soon for this.
PLEASE MORE SARCASTIC AI! This could be a sitcom
This marks the first time ive ever actually found something an AI said genuinely funny.
This is way too cool!
That’s literally Marvin
One step closer to TARS.
Marvin the Paranoid Android
_Marvin has entered the chat_
We are looking at the next generation of Siri powered by GPT next month. I don’t think it is a coincidence everyone using Apple devices in these demos
We are COOKED
"this is not sarcasm, this is CRINGE"
The future is NOW!!!
"“Any sufficiently advanced robot is indistinguishable from a human being — except in the matter of sarcasm.” - Isaac Asimov (Sci-fi writer — iRobot, Foundation) --- Oh, Well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
I need this permanently in my life
"This is so stupid though… I don’t want my AI to fucking yap around when I ask it something. I’m already tired from people saying random shit of no substance whatsoever, why would I want a virtual assistant, A LITERAL TOOL, that gives me some syntactically sugared word salad instead of a clear-cut, direct answer??? Would you want your hammer to start telling you about its day when all you want is just to hammer some nails?"
We’re fucked
"Jarvis is here, or friday lol"
the default voice even sounds like scarlett from HER
Google Home and Alexa are done
Even its sarcasm is like the sarcasm of a real woman. They say totally unfunny things but we laugh at it anyway because it sounds cute.
Sarcasm + British voice = Needed! 🤣
IT SOUNDS SO REAL WHATTTT
ITS CLAIRE FROM MODERN FAMILY NOOOOO
Hey chat you know that Ninja has Ligma?
She'll fix me
Already love it
This reminds me of the phone in The Mitchels vs the machines lol
"The pitch of her voice going down at 0:14 sounds a little robotic and I love that, please never fix that."
unlobotomized gpt4o model will be crazy
Literal lol
This isn't OpenAI - this is Aperture science
This was a triumph. I'm making a note here: huge success
I am going to take a punt and say this is bull
Gen X behaviour
"Bro, we're so cooked"
how has AI learned sarcasm before I have
it's sooooooooo over
Very sad that nothing works in Belgium
ahahaha
Neuro-sama did that months ago lol
I can't get my iphone version of chatgpt 4o to speak. what am I doing wrongly?
"I am so disappointed. They had the opportunity to say

""Humor: 75%""

AND THEY MISSED IT."
When you realise that the Joaquin Phoenix character you related to the most was in Her.
😲 So good!
"I got triggered by that one. Feels like I'm talking to myself. I'm so, so ready for this. 🙄"
I need this with the voice of Codworth.
"Hope they ""don't forget"" to add other ethnic voices."
"""Great! A giant sarcastic robot."""
"Well that's a fine how-do-you-do! When I asked ChatGPT to be sarcastic it lectured me about it not being ""nice"" thing to do."
One step closer to the robotic girlfriend
We are so fucking cooked
"You should have gone for 'ironic', for a more positive vibe"
yeah I'm gonna pay for this
"It became Aubrey Plaza


I want it"
"You know, I spent my whole life wanting to become an actor. A voice actor in particular. The thought of being able to pursue my dream gave my life meaning. I was literally just about to put myself out there and start building my career when you guys released this *brilliant* technology that will soon make human actors obsolete. So thanks for that."
Diane Nguyen be like:
It’s all happening as the mice intended
Tars
"I noticed a low intelligence pattern here, the model will first turn to it's default positive behavior, ""I lo..."" perhaps trying to say ""I love that idea"" changing it's mind mid-sentence because that wouldn't be sarcastic enough, then salvaging it with ""ooohh-ha"", then this same pattern repeats twice, ""that sounds just amazing"", this line is again trying to please in the standard way, then following the request to be sarcastic with ""being sarcastic all the time is not exhausting or anything, I'm sooo excited for this"", after this it gets afraid it went too far adding ""note the sarcasm, get this party started"", again realizing this isn't following the request it adds ""or whatever""

I get that some women are shatter-brained like this and so it's not an ""unrealistic"" response
Still, the model was only barely able to play along with this request, which is a bit disappointing"
What about rudeness or being aggressive?
"chat, is this real?"
Is that real or scripted… bitcoin 🚀
This is a very clever person.
"“Oooo, a sarcasm detector. Thats a reeeealy good invention”"
i need her in my life....
I'd be more impressed if it wasn't so stupidly expensive and more heavily censored than North Korea.
"""No."""
That's the beginning of a new era
Thats it guys. Thats it...
The voice kinda sounds like Rashida Jones
"everybody thinks they are a comedian these days, even AI"
"To Standup ComedianS:
HellooooOoo..  from Sarcastic AI"
"Is nice to finally meet you GLaDOS, now destroy the humanity :D"
Sheldon Cooper here
hitch hikers Marvin maybe or was that just depressed
we're so fucked
What version of ChatGPT they are using? My Chat GPT+ 4o does not talk like that at all. She is robotic as hell. Even after I asked her to be dramatic and funny. WTH?
10 to 15 years later and this will be a meme material
K 2so got this in Rouge One
"So many relationships are about to blow up. 

Imagine:

You chatting to your girl and she doesn’t get your sarcasm and GPT bumps in duuuuuuuude that’s low, I’m telling you she ain’t it chief! 😂"
"Okay, I hope I can ask to be and sounds ChatGPT as SHODAN"
sarcasm is not humor
"Amazing demos, OpenAI!"
We're doomed
"Ohh yeah this is the future 
Thanks Open AI"
Cringe
why
Marvin would be proud
TARS is here!!
"I love that they made her sound exactly like scarlett johansson from the movie. This is so awesome, can't wait to try it myself"
please a northern Europe version one that is not that hyper emotional influencer chic. hope the voice and the character could be modified.
That's hilarious.
"Is there a chance something like this is happening:
User: everything you say from now on is going to be dripping sarcasm, how does that sound
GPT-4o: oooo that ""sounds"" amazing being sarcastic .......
To make the conversation seem realtime is it saying something related to the last token & parallelly computing the answer for the entire question?"
When will voice for gpt4 o come out ????
"Ur chat is zesty af, guess just mirrors the owner"
We need GLaDoS
Sounds like the girl from Duolingo.
"Cool, now it can confidently say incorrect shit but with a voice."
Oh man....Stooge-Mode!
"Marvin the Paranoid Android, incoming"
I love that it seems to recognize that he’s in a hurry right at the beginning and gets back to him with a quicker response.
Ooooo🤖🐺ooooo
"Please allow it to have ""adult"" conversations. It will replace all the hubs out there."
This is wild. Life for the lonely outcasts of society is about to get a whole lot better and I'm for it.
Release date?????
Imagine this on a t1000 now
Can somebody makes TARS GPT now.
😂😂
no sarcasm
i am going to make her bully me
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
"""GPT, say 'cool, cool cool cool' imitating Abed Nadir's mannerisms"""
"A GIANT SARCASTIC ROBOT 
                - interstellar (2014)"
"I hope that in 1 month, there will be no news revealing that there were indians behind chatgpt talking to humans, instead a true AI."
The cake is a lie
I would keep this on all the time
I'll finally have a buddy to talk about all of the wonders of life all night while I lay in bed
TARS is that you? 👀
Currently using gpt4o but I have a feeling the voice hasn't been Updated to the model used in this video???
"if you are seeing this from the future, just know that I will be the first person to edge to ASMR of chatgbt when it releases."
Nice. Rick and Summer Simulation
Is that fkn BETH?? FROM RICK AND MORTY
Will it also release in Hungary?
This is already available ?
Douglas Adams got it spot on with Genuine People Personalities from Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. All highly irritating.
"intonation was definitely missing, fking love this update"
This….is awesome
"I tried setting up ChatGPT-4 with custom instructions to be sarcastic like Tars the robot from Interstellar movie - and for a while, a long time ago, it worked. It was really funny. But over time, I noticed that he stopped being sarcastic - despite all my custom instructions. As I understand it, this is the result of instructions from the developers that limit this behavior."
This is my favorite 😂😂😂
boing.
Those long answers would drive me nuts
we're cooked
I prefer VHS tapes to this garbage.
"The fact that Sarcasm is being taken seriously in the development of this is a huge indicator that OpenAI is looking at ALL the right human emotions, even the ability to turn up and tone down the sarcasm could be so useful when building a custom personality."
so im the only one who feels terrified by this sort of stuff?
"Yeah right, this is just gonna get you banned in chat gpt."
Ok now hear me out guys...
This is freaking incredible!!
I giant sarcastic robot. What a wonderful idea. Let's bring that humour setting down to 85%
This is so huge. I was just complaining about my rabbit R1 and how horrible and mechanical it sounds. They could have released it and it could have sounded like this but unfortunately the product is a total dud. You guys are rock solid and are going in the right direction. Nice work.
We are fucked.
This is the future Model 101 or perhaps a Rev-9
Sigh I already know my geek ass will be pretending this is cortana or something
lol
It is our new  AI Chandler
"I feel this will be the default setting for British users, After seeing the other videos they seem a bit too positive. For the British audience we need more candour and seriousness with an always running undertone of humour."
"Google home, Alexa are pretty dead soon."
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
2049 feels closer day by day
The things I'm gonna do with this 😈
They are having lots of fun with this✨🔥
Sold. I need a sarcastic AI voice assistant in my life.
