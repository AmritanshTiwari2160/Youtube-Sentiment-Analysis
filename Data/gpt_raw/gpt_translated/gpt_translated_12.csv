Finally AI seem to be going in a good direction man. üòÖ
This technology would be so cool with smart glasses
WHAT!?! Amazing ü§©
is this usable today for anyone?
"You should create a box people can buy for their loved ones who feel sad and lonely at home, so they can talk to it and get motivated to do something again. Like a dog but without the hassle that you have to train and care for it."
You know what this mean? People who don't see won't struggle as much. Good job open ai!
Movie franchises would cook with this üòÇ
"Yup, cancelling GPT Plus, when 4o is available for free users ‚ò∫"

OpenAI just Killed the Rabbit. R1
Lol gpto still thinking about his dog. Never seen phone nor human so smitten with a puppy in all my life. Okay that felt weird saying just now.. lol
At this point I‚Äôm going to ask chat gpt to live my life
RIP Google Lens üò¢
brought tears to my eyes.
It even helps blind people!
This is scary bro üòÇ
"Hmm now tell me ,are there any secret underground passages that lead directly into the kings room?"
Living in the simulation... Andrew tate was right all along...wake up bros üòÇ
Great technological progress
If you could link the meta glasses to this..
"I extract a lot more than your expectations from be my AI current Access but definitely when this update will be live how amazing it would be. I can't wait to try it!.
Relying on others is a very stupid thing these days. I remember I was very excited when I get the description of  my teacher's lecture with be my AI. I really enjoyed how she presented by making a diagram and the way be my AI explain that diagram. It was awesome! I can't wait. Imagine when my teacher is giving lecture and I just point this open. AI chat gpt4 on whiteboard same time the chat gpt will explain to me the movements like sign language  of my teacher and that excitement will be very amazing.
When I got that description of the diagrams. I sent  that actually to the be my ai and they were very happy that I'm using this product like this. I love to do experiments. Let's see what I will do when it will come in my hands. Haha"
Love London we do love yourselves ourselves royal divine majestys
That T-1000 is going to walk you right off a cliff
"Integrating this in an eye wear, will make it a real life Jarvis"
Now we still need a good interface for people who are both blind and old. So they can no longer learn the blind operation from the iPhone. So just open the app and the camera and microphone are active and you can get started immediately. Just hold the camera in that direction and ask what do you see or something similar. Without necessary interaction via the screen.
now put that AI on smart glasses and you got a great tool.
"They gave her Scarlet's voice from the movie ""her"""
What
The idea that blind people have a better 'view' of the world makes me happy
"as a blind guy, I don't see anything"
This is what AI should be all about! Kudos OpenAI
GPT-4o+Apple vision pro=
"Letting AI coming up with realistic intonation is fine, but adding extra personality remarks, like ""how nice it is for the king to be at home"" or ""what a good dog"" is not fitting for me. I prefer the strictly ""professional"", impersonal style."
Terrible how they give a positive spin on everything. You could be having s‚Ç¨–∂ with a minor or planting a b–±mb and they‚Äôd probably encourage you and find it ‚Äúexciting‚Äù.
Eye opener
"Wondering if the version of ChatGPT is current, heard somewhere that version 3 was only up to 2020 or something like that."
"This technology is already using your phone camera. Watching where you are, and what you do, so it can provide you with applicable phone content.
The content provided will be too far specific for it to be simply coincidence."
we are snowballing towards  AGI at this point
I‚Äôm glad technologies like this are being developed
BE MY AE ANNYEONG HASEYO AESPA IMNIDA
That's the ai for future
The sad thing is that corporations will try to make a profit from this.
"Interesting, but scary"
"Imagine if this becomes wearable, its amazing."
"I think the only thing missing is that GPT-4o seems to only say something after the user did, but it for example it does not react things that suddenly happen on the video feed or if you'd say ""hold on a sec"" it wouldn't ask after some time ""are you still there?"". But other than that, VERY IMPRESSIVE"
What‚Äôs with the voice change at the end haha
Does anyone know when this will be generally available?
"this will change the world, again"
ok
I would like to think that Scarlett Johansson might be glad on one level for hearing of  how tech which uses her voice likeness is being used helpfully.
Is that Scarlett‚Äôs johansen?
This can't possibly be true. OMFG
wow
dog just lost his job
OpenAI shocked the world today ‚Äî great product release!
this is really cool today i cant sleep
"Wow, that‚Äôs right. With this update, gpt will be able to view the scenery live and explain it.."
"""Well, I see a very high mountain and Christ the Redeemer above. There is also a young man coming towards us with a black jacket. It looks like he is hooded. Now it looks like he raised his hand towards the camera... Jo√£o, why are you running ?‚Äù"

Google crying
Wow open ai is on fire
HER
When will this become available to the public?
The taxi's light is off
Even my eyes are obsolete now
Probably there will be a kinda tough back robot that will tell direction by touching your by and giving signal
Man I can't even image what 2030 would look like üòÆüòç proud to be born in 21st century.
Now imagine Neuralink + GPT-4o
This will be the best thing ever happened in my life
Mr. Anderson‚Ä¶.
Mind is officially blown ü§Ø
Imagine this being a real time Car Driving  Safety Assistant üòä
Everyone liked that!
"as a visually impaired person, this blows my mind and makes me worried as well. I'm not sure what to think anymore. These models still have a room to improve, but it is pretty scarry"
Omg we need offline!
What would be amazing is a new type of device to make things even easier for disabled accessibility. Maybe wearables will get a new lease on life like glasses or similar.
this being integrated to the blind person's glasses so they do not have to hold the phone all the time would be a life changer. I hope they'll train (or have trained) the AI with other languages to the same level of fluency (more languages than the handful of those major ones like Apple typically does)
Blind guy: checks behind door before opening it.
"i am sorry, but i still don't believe it works like that, can't try for myself"
Super!
My friend uses Be My Eyes. I have to check if it's already rolled out to everybody
"So, eye dogs are in danger now will be kicked out their jobs üòÇ"
last part was scripted. Car blinker was on before the guy stuck his thumb out.
Blind and deaf people will soon have AI Navigators.... that will go into bionic eyes and bionic ears.
"GPT 4o: ""You‚Äôve reached the current usage cap for GPT-4o, please try again at 10:00 pm"".

Blind guy: ""fuck"""
wooow
"I have the paid subscription, but I can't figure out how to show it a live view, is this available yet?"
"As a blind person, I'm thankful to be living in 2024, we're experiencing something that wasn't possible for centuries, feels like I'm part of a revolutionary movement"
yo
Any AI who likes dogs is an AI I approve of. ü•∞ Hehe.
"mindblown ? yes
Excited about the futur ? hell yeah
hotel ? trivago."
this is quite an AGI
üò≠üò≠ wowwowowow
Imagine this was integrated into glasses which has a camera.
This could be a big help for visually impaired people.
Amadeus from steins gate is real
Hell yes
great jog hailing that taxi
"got me crying openai, godspeed devs!"
"50 years ago just went down the drain...the new term is ""in 5 years time"""
Holy smokes
THEY DID IT LOOOL
The future is here my people...
Now the AI is taking away the jobs of guide dogs too
good
:D
"I'd love to make a joke about the 'taxi' taking  him off to the machine's human re-education facility, but I won't - this is actually pretty amazing."
"Just read a story that the US Marines are training with an armed Boston Dynamics robot dog.  Once we program that robot with this technology, we should be able to quickly destroy humanity.  It‚Äôs like Skynet or Matrix.. except we‚Äôre not even trying to stop it."
This is the way of A.I.
"I love this but the taxi is pulling over before he signals... was the camera operator signalling, right?"
Damn seeing eye dogs about to lose all their jobs üíÄ
"Blind Man: Is it safe to cross the road?
Open Ai: Yes
Blind Man:"
interesting for Blind people
I love the voice so much ü•¥
And the blind shall see
integrating this into smart glasses or something like that would be life changing
Lol
"One thing I've noticed: GPT-4o can't be trained to chat about adult/explicit topics. GPT-4 had no problems to do it via the API, but it seems GPT-4o has some new restrictions... "
Imagine losing internet connection
really nice
This a huge one!
the best use case
Obviously scripted.
I don't know how any of their attorneys could ever sign off for the product to be used in this manner. All it takes is a person not pointing the phone in the correct direction for the AI to miss some hazard that injures or kills the user. Way too many variables here for this to be very safe or practical without custom hardware.
"""It gets into a car like it's no problem‚Ä¶ 0:58."""
"I can definitely see someone putting this into glasses and selling a subscription to afford the OpenAI fees. The glasses could see what‚Äôs in front of you and tell you immediately what‚Äôs going on. Someone would probably need to change the code to have 0 latency and no ‚Äúums‚Äù and ‚Äúuhs‚Äù I know that they are there to sound human, but to help someone navigate the world with no eyes, they would rather have immediate updates on what‚Äôs going on around them. This could be a pretty cool product/service, likely be able to build a massive 8-9 figure DTC brand. Getting VCs to back something like this wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult and getting an angel to start wouldn‚Äôt be that difficult I wouldn‚Äôt think. Just move out to Silicon Valley I‚Äôd assume."
"i remember watching the movie ""Her"" when i was a teen... this is insane it's happening so fast"
Wow we are cooked man
Helping people must be a core principle of technological progress.
Imagine taking mobile in bathroom..
Happy but same time afraid üò¢
Is this scene from the movie HER? Crazy that Sci-fi from just a few years ago is now reality!
The taxi was already indicating before he hailed it lol. Staged much?
"Will this be available in the gpt chat application itself, or in Be My Eyes? And when will there be new features in the android application?"
Her part 2 lets goooo
this is insane
"OpenAI just killed like 3 startups projected to make a billion dollars with this one update.

If youre making an AI wrapper, just give up dawg."
That poor doggo lost his job
yeah the only good thing the AI  is going to bring to humanity
Holy smokes‚Ä¶ this one made my eyes water.

Can it do optical character recognition?
"""Her"" is Here."
We're now truly entering a new age.
"SUGGESTION: As a tool that can potentially help visually impaired people, I find particularly disturbing that the promo video is not accesible to them. It should contain a brief verbal description of what the video is about, and what the images are depicting. It wouldn¬¥t be a bad idea to hire visually impaired people to help developing and marketing this type of tools, so it¬¥s not just a marketing campaing but an actual effort to promote accesibility."
Incredible
"""That's a good dog right there!"" ROFL"
"Rabbit R1 and I already forgot the name of the other, got overtaken in a manner of days"
"What's with the face, Alexa?"
What a power to humanity.
I may be the only one who thinks that the blinds will feel much more gloomy since they are unable to see.
is that scar jo's voice?
"Cool tech, but just waaaaayyyy too close to ""Her"" from 2013. GPT saying ""ummm..."" before describing the ducks just feels creepy.
EDIT: 0:19 mark."
"They should build a pair of glasses with a camera and speaker like the Facebook glasses. A third party should build a small app with an API so there are no limits. You could charge a monthly fee, and I don't think this will be too costly. This will change the lives of blind people for sure. I had the idea right away when I saw the video of Greg Brockman."
It's gonna be a huge help for the blind people
"You guys are the best. Good job, really good job. What a cool use case"
"This is what we've all wanted - AI that makes life easy, especially for those that face physical challenges."
Unbelievable!!!!
Where to get the IOS version that is not just ChatGPT but what you are showing in the video??
Gotta respect it
this is crazy
Simply amazing.
"GPT-4o when a dog comes into frame: ""Can I pet dat dawg??"""
Who else didn't realize he was blind until he entered the taxi?
Kinda sounds like scarlet johanson
Now intergrate it to the Apple Vision Pro and the future is herer
They are ending even dog's careers. jesus :D
She exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§‚ù§üòÆ
I don't like how it talks to you like a child. I hope we can give the model context on how we want to be spoken to.
Around 20s I thought he was asking what's the king doing lol
"I‚Äôm not blind but I want to talk to this all day, I want it in my glasses, speaking in this voice everywhere I go!"
"the added comments like ""good job getting that taxi"" or ""how exciting to be here"" would drive me nuts"
The end game for human.
"This is definitely one of the most useful applications of the vision option of GTP-4o. For vision impaired people this is not just a little fun feature to play with, but can really improve their mobility and awareness of their surrounding. Very nice!"
Oh my god ? ! Wtf
this is something u guys doing good! üëç
I'm just thinking about the financial implications of this.
"wow It's great!!! 
for Human for People! T..T"
Ai help who have learning disabilities and learning problems thanks open ai and god you guys are doing great things
AI should be primarily used for Disabled people ‚ù§
When will it be available in be my eyes app?
Let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object üóø
"Was that a Richard Ayoade vocal cameo? I love this so much. Even before the video got to the end and I saw it was a Be My Eyes collab, I was thinking to myself this will potentially straight up replace Be My Eyes with the instant live feedback."
"THIS IS THE VOICE FROM THE MOVIE ""HER""
WTF"
I have no jokes for this.  This is amazing!
I hope my grandkids see this comment...if you see this kids your grandad was a champ... He wifed Beyonce.‚ù§üéâ
Holy tomoly absolutely crazy. I love how it can help people
One of my favorite tv shows was Humans which was on Amazon. We are getting close!
"The ‚Äúbe my eyes‚Äù feature hasn‚Äôt rolled out yet, right?"
"Some girls will be like: ""Are you filming me without consent?"" ""I don't care if you are blind or not"""
Sounds Exactly Like Scarlet Johanson in 'Her'
RIP Rabbit R1 üíÄ
"OpenAI gives me the same excitement I was getting from Apple back in the day. FINALLY, a company is innovating again."
"I‚Äôm totally blind, I travel widely and this definitely needs some disability awareness training. It's exciting tech, I‚Äôll use it, but a grown man hailing a cab does not need praise. That's how you‚Äôd talk to a 6 year old out on the town with his daddy for the first time ‚Ä¶ also every guide dog user knows they are the leader, the dog does not call the shots."
I'd be v careful waving your phone around in London :) LOTS of phone thefts.
Siri should retire..
"I'm telling you now, I didn't know he was blind until I saw the dog. That is NUTS."
"Did they make her sound similar to Scarlett Johansson from ""Her"" on purpose?"
"As a blind user of Be My Eyes, I can‚Äôt wait until this is generally available. I am currently using GPT four ‚Äì turbo, a text based model, and it isn‚Äôt practical for some tasks."
next news Sunder pichai left google

openAI opening eyes üôÉ
So good!
Blind people watching this video must be so hyped!
SCRIPTED.
"Potentially dangerous, crossing busy roads"
The only unrealistic part of this video is that the taxi stops for you
How can i activate this function
Oh god finally we have a Pok√©dex!
I wonder how many seconds/milliseconds it takes for it to see something and report that it sees it.
Yep.
We don't want AI to replace Designers or Journalists. We want robots that make laundry and cook healthy meals.
how to use this camera feature? I didn't find any interface for that
Now this is an amazing use case!
"that is amazing
I am visually impaired And I think this could be very u should fall for me And I think this could be very useful for me."
This can change the life of millions of disabled people if integrated into smart glasses
"""Where are the apples in this store?""

""Right in front of you Dave""

""Ey what the f man leave my damn basket alone"""
Wow! Kudos to all the scientists and engineers and everyone.
"I'm so impressed by this honestly. I just saw the other video of the 2 people playing rock paper scissors, and that was also very impressive."
Is this also possible in other languages?
A monumental game-changer for the visually-impaired!
My companion Alexandre Braun uses this application/system
This is accurate except for the fact that UK OpenAI subscribers won't get any more updates until after Charles is dead.
How do I get the camera feature to work?
RIP dogs with jobs! Even man's best friend isn't safe!üêï‚Äçü¶∫
AI again created new benchmarks.
Woow Is like Start Up dorama!!! <3
this is damn creepy
Wow!!! Love it!!!
i thought this was a comedy skit until i saw the channel that posted it
AI comments here aswell?
We are close to that movie HER then we think
Ai/AR/VR glasses
This makes me so happy
"Damn, this one got emotional. Like K-drama Startup (2020)"
"1% helping people
99% helping people kill each other"
"Now, even blind people can experience the confusion from visual hallucinations through the magic of hallucinatory AI!"
I'll believe this works this good when I see and hear it with my own eyes.

"The only mistake i saw was the voice saying ""Yeshhsh"" weirdly"
epick
"Until this, he had to ask a stranger to help him... no more human interaction anymore..."
So it copied the rabbit r1? Interesting...
"And this is how they introduce it to you. How ""honorable"" of a purpose."
Her
The voice is so condescending.
"Incredible, absolutely incredible."
why wasnt the taxi light on
"""walk past the road""
""are there any vehicles?""
""you'll find out"""
At least hopefully this will offer more help than that Humane AI pin ü§£
Thats outstanding
apple phone at 1%
This is fantastic!
"Man this is so impressive, glad to see a positive change in technology for blind people!"
"This actually made me tear up, we are there."
This got me emotional. This is beautiful!
What???
Genuinely impressive
"As a completely blind person, this gives me so much hope! Can you please provide any details how soon this will actually be available to be my AI or in general use? Or if it is available already, what app do we download? I am so anxious to get this application"
Her Part 2 looks great!
Just imagine you are a blind ü¶Ø and Gpt took you to the road to the car that stoped for you and the same time another car try to overtake but unfortunately your internet got dump that gpt couldn't work. üòÇ
This goes even beyond what we thought was pretty incredible watching Star Trek.
"I'm skeptical that responses will be in real time. Depending multiple factors such as network speeds, sever utilization, and just general complexity of subject matter I still see us being at least a few years off from something as awesome as this."
It's a world-changing invention.
"I got really emtional after looking at this clips even as a person with good eye sight. Other demo are all nice dog and pony shows, but it shows how amazing Open AI already is."
bro my dumbass for a moment thought the ai called him a dog üíÄ
I can live out my secret agent fantasies üòÇ
What a wonderful use case! love it!
OpenAI apparently is discriminating against hiring older employees which is illegal
OpenAI is anything but open. I'll never give you access to my data or devices. Anyone points one at me I'll kick it out of their hand too.
why doesn't elon do this with twitter
i mean just put this in glasses already right
I feel so old now.
Insane leap for humankind üî•
RIP Rabbit R1
This is a bit touching
Brooo wtf it‚Äôs Her in real lifeüíÄ
What a game changer for the visually impared
This is like a stalkers dream software.
This model 100% will be in iphone
"Just put the phone in your shirt's front pocket, have u even seen the movie Her?"
"even without the camera, this would be EPIC if a watchOS app were somehow made"
This is incredible.
When will this feature be launched in the application?
What a use case
Holy crap. Idk if i should be happy or go to a bunker asap..
bye bye human pin and rabbit r1 lol
"what if we have it in our glasses, like Vision Pro? I am looking forward to that."
holy friggen hell this is cool
"According to that fact that in every video they use Iphones, seems like they really integrate it into the their OS"
Now integrate all of this into glasses and it will be the product that breaks the cell phone
Shocking!
HER voice
"‚ÄúThen the blind people will see again, and the deaf will hear. Crippled people will jump like deer, and those who can't talk now will shout with joy‚Äù"
Impressive
It would've been better if it was trained by jessy and mr.white.
this is good tech. well done
"20 years from now, someone will watch the movie Her and say _""I don't get it. Is there something more to this that I'm missing?""_"
"She sounds like Rick‚Äôs daughter Beth, from Rick and Morty"
We advance
so cool!
yeah we all know it will be used to help blind... orrr the military has a better idea!
"We are inching closer to the terminator movies being a reality, and we don't even know it."
"This can be a total game changer and a useful tool for visually impaired folks, nice work openai üëçüèª"
So even the dogs are going to lose their jobs?
That means future kids will not lern by observing environment but asking to chat gptüò¢
Hey are you guys gonna have different voices? I want the robot from Interstellar! More voice options please!
Better than the Humane AI Pin & the Rabbit R1.
That's fake taxi üò¢
I'm in tears ü•≤ This is amazing.
Gotta love technology
I feel like some fat discord moderator will end up falling in love with this.
0:42 Oh my god. The real time taxi thing is very impressive and will actually be useful to many. Amazing job. üéâ
Now wearing apple vision pro outside may have a purpose.
This company will be remembered throughout the History just like Apple
Wtf guys wtf. Good job guys!
"AI is gonna create, remove and change so so many jobs"
"Meta glasses and GPT4.o , awesome combination for the visually impaired.‚ù§"
Absolutely incredible. I'd been watching all the other demos without even considering how it might be used to enable the blind to better perceive the world around them. Huge smile on my face. Bravo.
I hope rabbit enjoyed their 2 seconds of spotlight because this will send it home.
How they can handle the computing power needed for running this service in the realtime for millions of users?
Can‚Äôt wait for OpenAI to make this functionality accessible to users. The app lets me select 4o but it‚Äôs not the actual Omni model. Perhaps it‚Äôs just a bug on iOS. Rare L for OpenAI.
did they use Rashida Jones as the voice model?
The End of Human ERA
Living in a simulation folks.
Incredible!
how will a person with poor visibility know where to point the camera at?
How about be my voice for speech disability???
openai is rlly opening the ai now
"Was that necessary to add that many ""amazing"", ""exiting"", etc.  emotional bull crap? Can't hold my vomit reflex."
"Try to remember this is what could be, all you seen here in reality is a commercial.  it won't be free, it will cost too much and just the next step in keeping all of us poor and in a nice little box."
Imagine all the guide dogs that will be out of a job
How to access it? Is it available in other languages?
I hope you add text assistance for deaf people with translate deaf signs to text or sound
0:46 My dude signaling the stop before he even knew he had to stop üí™
It happened
Politically correct or biased AI would be horrible.
Open ai is an amazing Company
