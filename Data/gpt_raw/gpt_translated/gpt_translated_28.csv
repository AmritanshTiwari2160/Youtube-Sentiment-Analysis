"The future is billions of people sitting alone, with a birthday cake for one, whilst an AI sings happy birthday and laughs at bad jokes."
no chocolate . dont play with fire
we are cooked
"Yoooo we are in Spike Jonze movie, ""Her"" this is wild."
We are cooked with this one 🔥🔥💀
"Sorry to say this is a poor use case,humans require real interaction not virtual humans like replacement.


I know there will be some form of justification or argument about it.

It can be done doesn't always mean it should be done.

This use case is simply not necessary, while you think you are battling loneliness you will create more loneliness through virtual isolation."
"I like how they put two people in each of these to avert the impression that it’s mostly going to be people sitting alone interacting with it, which 100% will be the case"
I’m leaving my wife for this 😍
Some day Chat GPT will know that the cake is a lie
Woooooow
GPT-4o thinks everything sunshine and rainbows
🍰
This is all free btw
We are surely cooked
That's so awesome!!!
her is here 😭😭
"Idk, it sounds like she watched too much TV shows"
"The interruption system needs improvement, but overall really good"
damn
Gash
"Creepy and sad, imagine if you are doing this alone with ChatGPT"
It’s more human than most human
That's the birthday of AI
Ok no need anyone to pass the time anymore 😮
This isn’t chatGPT. This is Samantha from spike jonze’s HER. I’m scared.
We are fully cooked
"""Do you feel pain?""
Her: Yes!

oh don't worry guys, it's just predicting the next word :)"
"I want this with GLADOS voice,  so when it tries to kill me at least I can say it wasnt out of character."
<we're witnessing the end of the old world and the start of new one welcome to the new era humans>
dopple ai video chats finna go crazyyyyyyyyy
The future is now
"Alright it’s Westworld time soon boys and girls, Buckle up."
"Oh dear, she's so cute. And I'm gay."
Her
Tomorrow is Google IO. They need to have something better than this! 🙂Just kidding. They are roasted.
Bro that's a shitty birthday cake for poor Jordan🥲
"damn it even does bababababa, we're cooked"
What a time to be alive?
What we're going to evidence in future😂
It definitely falls a bit into the uncanny valley
"We used to use button phones 10 years ago, i feel so old now."
"Naaaa, I'm actually scared of the rate AI improves"
"This is gonna get hit for copyright soon, the happy birthday song is actually copyrighted and the people who own the rights are extremely litigious."
NEW WAIFU JUST DROPPED!
this is no way ai
No chance to tell it’s an AI 😮
In 2025 we’re gonna see animated films with  AI doing all the voice acting
"Oh my god, this is so real. I hope such physical robots will appear soon."
wow
Scarlett Johansson in shambles
"“I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle…”"
"They must make it good enough for people to want to replace their partners with AI, until then it's just kids play."
I can’t believe this.. there is simply no way
"As a human race we're so finished, human socialisation will basically become extinct."
ok when can i marry her
Fascinating how it gets the pacing wrong though.  I wonder if that wasn't a parameter it was trained on.  It will be cool to see if future versions fix this.
Ok best way to be isolated
Rabbit AI is cooked
Hopefully we can turn the cringe down from 10 to about 2 or 3..
It improvised. That is pretty effing impressive.
I think we should stop this.. like.. seriously what is the point??
"If this level of realism in the emotional department is consistent in long conversations, many people would definitely freak out about ""it"" being alive. There have been incidents with Google Gemini where I got spooked because of this ""realism"". Having an AI that can laugh and sing...that would just be so mind bending."
"how the f did they train this? synthetic data? the voice is very controlled, it's too perfect for it to be merely trained on conversations. some magic training data trick"
Soon I'm going have my first girlfriend yo.
ask it who was in paris
She is more excited than b'day boy😂
They gave her the same voice as Samantha. So much for foreshadowing her future
API lol
"0:19 that ""I'm intrigued"" sounds like it accidently showed its evil side for a moment"
we are in the worst timeline
Creepy as fuck
This is both cool and terrifying
"What are we doing? 
It's obviously we are smoking weed😅😅😅🎉"
It looks like friends. oh...
"Bro, wtf I'm still grinding FUT...I wasn't ready for this😂"
We're so beyond charred it's so over
New Black mirror season just dropped 😍
Chatgpt is even more emotional than I am😂
What was his wish???
I have the urge to power a game with this
Really I think ai gonna take over us within a decade
"If the next big AI meets the western world genocidal craziness we are all done for…
Who said Skynet?"
It's really hard to think that it's just a machine
"How does it feel to have your AI strip away hundreds of thousands of voices on this platform by a money hungry company saving storage space by removing their comments?
Must be nice and warm ☺️"
ALL HAIL THE A.I. OVERLORDS! BABBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why is the app only shown on iphone in all these demos? No android app?
I hope my grandkids get to see this comment... Your grandad wasn't a looser... He wifed Rihanna.... how's the resistance going? Hope we're winning the war???
it sounds more human than an actual human 
"No, no, no, no, pretend I'm John F. Kennedy and you are Marilyn Monroe.  Now sing me happy birthday..."
"Wow that's depressing and exciting!
Welcome to Black Mirror lads."
We’re cooked
A singularity has arrived
I'm overwhelmed by how much the world will change😇
Honestly cannot tell if this is an awesome teaser trailer for the next Terminator prequal movie or reality. It has that vibe from dystopian films where everything goes too perfect right before all goes to shit. I am not an AI skeptic. In fact I am from computer science and engineering background. Nevertheless this is seriously getting scary.
"""Happy birthday to... Jordan babalabalba"" 😂😂"
I’m jaw dropped.
"Wow OpenAI, your new AI model is amazing and exciting, because of this it seems like ChatGPT is like it has totally human tastes. I hope they continue releasing more models or that this one is the best"
we got almost jarvis before GTA 6
The Cake is a lie
"You know you could just escape this dystopian with just one simple trick. Just sleep, and not waking up"
Masterful improvements! And a significantly improved voice that eerily simulates emotions in addition to the nuances of the human voice box. Sounds like they used a new version of Sky's voice in the live demos? Open AI has masterfully taken all of the best aspects of apps like Inflection AI's PI as well as Hume AI's emotionally intelligent model and bundled them into GPT 4O (omni model) for free. They just destroyed the possibility of others catching up because they haven't even announced GPT 5! I'm really impressed and excited for this rollout to the masses. 🎉👍🏾👏🏾
we cooked good
Wow that’s actually scary good omg
We’re in the present!
GOOD BYE 3.5
"_Aside_ from this being uploaded on my actual birthday, the humor and inflection added stepped this up to a whole other level of realism!"
*THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN*
Why its in my recommendation?
It's so human
Mindblowing! Wow - creepy as f### & awesome❤
Great. This is incredible. She's very funny.
dawg 💀💀
It got better sense humour than me 😂
Wait whaatt !!! 😱😱
"We got ""her"" before GTA 6"
We're so overcooked 😂💀
13.05.2024
For lonely people 😢
I can say I was there
Finally I can abandon my friends for the best AI best friend ever that will just keep getting better and better. 😂
"They need to make a chat gpt that’s depressed , the laughs and happy emotions are freaking me out"
we're in the future
i love it
Wtf
Tech that will change the world. Whether it’s for the better or worse that might be up to its user. It feels sad to use that to help you feel special on your birthday but loneness would be a thing of the past for alot of people
"Oh no, they’re teaching the AI about cake"
Bruh i'm just sat here imagining the gaming possibilities
"Nahhh, this is wild."
Finally will have an (AI) girlfriend who will sing to me on my birthday!
Well at least we can get rid of all those customer reps we can't understand?
Man it really cleared its throat lmfao.
"That’s cool, but how can I fuck it?"
what a time to be alive
off course she's from LA
babababbaba?!?!!??
"Can't wait for my AI girlfriend. Never had any luck with humans, maybe this will fill the void"
Who remembers Scotty talking into a mouse in Star Trek IV? ChatGPT is even more capable than the sci fi tech of 23rd century.
Gg
The first time I have laughed at/with AI
Let her come to india gonna check it can how it is going to detect my object 🗿
Incoming subscription based open world video games with dozens of NPC’s each with their own personalities you can talk to and gain information from.
"WOW, yu cannot see the difference, excpet maybe too good to be human"
It's a live-action version of the movie
Thank you Scarlett!
Business insights tomorrow... Bout to see a lot of red arrows this week.
It's crazy...
"Bro did this thing just say ""babababa"" like a little joke at the end? Like it had an actual personality? like an actual person? What else are ya'll hiding over there guys?"
I CANNOT EVEN!!!
Can you cure any disease or cancer? 😂😂😂
Is marrages goin to absolute???
now sing it like Skyler from Breaking Bad
PLEASE dial down the fake excitement
"It was even giggling as it was singing, almost like she was embarrassed a bit. This is fucking wild, I was mind blown when ChatGPT first came out, and I’m mind blown once again, even more so this time. What a fucking time to be alive."
We're fucked
"I though AI girlfriends was really dumb and lame, but I just caught myself saying ""that was cute!"" and now I hate it..."
Who wanna hear gpt indian accent 😅
new gf just dropped
There are going to be some devious mfs telling it to do asmr and doing heinous stuff
Gotta love the cheerfulness
"this is actually insane. idk if im overreacting, its still early"
In 10 years it will take over the world🫡
I Guess that solidifies the partnership with Apple
"I can't stop thinking about the movie ""Her"". Have we finally gotten there?"
"Living in the future, i feel like a time traveler 😂"
"im literally in shock, i dont even know how to react or what to say...i feel i just witnessed something impossible..."
Scarlett Johansson better sue thoses guys for using HER voice.
Hope we’re not reaching the height of what text-transformers are capable of. I’m excited to see how this gets even better.
That AI woman sounds more humane than all of my friends!
"his wish: ""please don't kill us"""
"I'm going to keep saying please and thank you because when it all comes to kill us it say “Spare this one, he was always polite!”"
M3GAN's voice make-over
Marilyn Monroe rolling in her grave
These videos have Ads!? That's sad ..
that awkward laugh before it started singing
"Can we adjust voice and voice's ""demeanour""?

Id like more C3PO"
I knew it was coming. I just didn’t know it was coming this fast 😰
bruh LOL
Mind blowing
This only 6 years since gpt came out. Imagine 10 years from now. It's gonna be craaaazyyy.
It's getting so much better so much faster
Why there is a glitch in 0:24.
😨
what a scary dog
Scary.
Wow
"Holy molly, it's too real!
We are soooo f'kd and I'm ready for it."
Absolutely surreal.
"i hope theres a less obnoxiously ""human"" persona."
it's babababa out of 10
I wonder what AGI would look like!
How is this real
nope nope nope nope nope Ima refuse to believe it's real shits too scary
It's giving Glados vibes
We are doomed
Hollywood should be very careful on making Sci fi movies this days.
Hi to my grandkids... your grandad was a menace 😂
"I don't know what to do
Selebrate because this will do so much good
 or be upset
Because it will do so much bad in hands of scammers or bad people or even dictators like putin kim and so on"
Wow 2
Ai girlfriend here we go
It’s a good day 🎉🎉😎
"Day by Day, we are getting closer to skynet"
Where was this under lockdown? It could have saved so many minds going crazy.
bro I HOPE this is not staged because it looks UNREAL
I am suspicious of possess...😁
soo good but scary at the same time
"No way, that *thing* is not sentient."
"Hate these phobia people making comments below, they are the ones slowing down our technology development then complaining why tech so stupid afterwards."
"GTP-4o is now my wife. By the time GTP 6 comes out. We'll  have AI girlfriends, and I will spend everything I have."
Bring Scarlett Johansson
"Damn. Still no videos of it singing ""Still alive"" :("
"this is basically HER, we're in the timeline guys!"
"For the love of GOD, why, why, whyyyyyyy?! How to be disturbing, pathetic and delusional? I know. Let's pretend to be friends with a ""toy""."
my bday is tdy too lol
i wonder if she will always sing like this if yes then it is just recorded
We are sooooo done ☺️
The Ai talks like young Sheldon
wonder how it reacts to nudity?
fucking freaking ai.
"what i just want to know is based on the limited rate of GPT-4o, how long can I talk with it? Perheps only serveral minutes will I used up all the usage number."
We're one step closer to the apocalypse. 😊😁😄😁😄😊😊
she's my wife
😲
OpenAI shocked the world today — great product release!
"brooo this is so crazy that she is laughing because he is laughing, damn i am so excited for the future aaaaaaahh!!"
I never thought seriously of having an AI girlfriend. What have I turned myself into?
My future wife
You realize ai uses so much energy and water its not the future
Happy birthday Jordan 🥳🥳🥳
Let's just call her Samantha! This is VERY real.
So how do you use the video real time chat with GPT? I have GPT plus and GPT 4o but when I talk to the ai it does not have vision and no emotion to it’s voice.
oh boy now i will never make my birthday alone lol
