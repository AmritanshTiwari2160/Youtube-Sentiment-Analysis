Why this channel keeps pop on on my home page?
That's just insane!
"Hey, Jarvis! Code me a ""hello world""."
"""but can't see anything on the screen""

- Yea I call susge on that one."
drop the app i need it for coding
"This is regular chatgpt with a cool text to speech feature that can speak with some emotion, not anything revolutionary"
Will it available for windows or only Mac?
Is the macOS app already available?
This would be a great lawyer for the public
We‚Äôre cooked
okay but why would it be on a mac? just release it on windows first
how i can use the mac desk app like in video?
It seems Skynet will be very chatty and helpful when it crushes our skulls
Where is GPT-5?
imagine open space office full of yappers
ChatGPT 4o is the level version of cm punk pipebomb.
"Hi, using the desktop I've tried your use case: talking with gpt 4o while sending him a copy paste of my code. But can't send the texte code without leaving the talk session. What am I missing here ?"
when is this releasing?
"Question/Concern...  In a real world scenario, how much of that data/visuals is being transmitted to Open AI's (or third party) servers and how much is stored?  Can the AI be run locally or in secured proprietary locations?  In a real world scenario that type of process could very well be a trade secret."
fycking love this!!!
Congratulation
what if all of them are just made by ai itself.. even including video recording.. in my my opinion one day it will be possible and no one will be able to understand.
its like sci-fi movie
"Why does the AI say dumb stuff like ""I am excited to see the plot when you're ready""?  It's not excited...it's lying...why is the AI so annoying and talk so much?"
When is the desktop app's release date?
"Seems cool and helpful but this makes me think about teachers/professors being replaced with AI that can be coded to provide false information to learning minds, where as a human teacher would (hopefully) let their conscious dictate whether or not they should be teaching false information. Also, we all know that future students are going to abuse the crap out of AI to just do all the work and problem solving for them. Even scarier to think what big corporations would do with AI technology. 

Having a personal helper that is smarter than you and can walk you through or do the work for you can be cool, but where do we draw the line? How far are we as humans going to allow AI to dominate in certain areas? You know, Pandora's Box and all that? 

‚ÄúYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.‚Äù"
What? Where all those naysayers? ...they still think 3.5 is the best they have. So many critics on YT only ever try 3.5. And scoff when it fails simple things.
I just tried GPT-4o... It is so fast. Like GPT-3.5 turbo fast
"I'm just waiting for ""COMPUTER"" from Star Trek.  It would be the perfect ""assistant""! :)"
I can't wait to be able to use the Desktop app! I hated having to switch between Chrome tabs and VSCode to access GPT - the fact that I can always have it open and it can even see my screen is a game changer.
"And it says the temperature both Celsius and Fahrenheit... Interesting, does GPT4 knows that it has to give both base on the person the data is presented to; despite that the data (y axis) is in Celsius...
Look predefined answers more than automated"
So there is no point in trying to become a programmer anymore?
In b4 Two Minute Papers makes a video on this.
The plot looks like Indian flag
"This was pretty lame, it didn't extrapolate anything that wasn't obvious through looking at the data/code and then proceeded to read the temperature in units that weren't used on the graph. Kind of disappointing."
Im excited for open source clones of this app which we will be able to extend and build upon
"The first thing i will say, hey gpt can i you call you Jarvis? and from that it will be the end. This is wild omg can't wait. I'll be facking iron man"
Appreciate the euphemism but this is not assistance this is a  replacement
"Idk, ChatGPT already does this without the voice. It's an improvement alright but for me it's already doing what I want."
So ai is a female
I need to learn manual labor ASAP
"Let me show it unreadable code I've written (which even I don't know what it does).
Pretty sure it will come up with some crazy unexpected explanation üòÄ"
"F A N T A S T ƒ∞ C. 

ƒ∞ love Artificial ƒ∞ntelligence.  üíã

Artificial ƒ∞telligence for everyone.  üó∫Ô∏è"
wow.
Amazing!!!
All of this in just in a computer. This could accelerate learning beyond our comprehension.
"They watched ""Her"" and was like yup we can do that."
I need the desktop app for windows. :D
"I don't see how this helps you in coding, the moment you write a function you already know what it should do otherwise you wouldn't write it."
"Bring the App to Windows, please!!!"
"You should know that this ""ai"" does not create anything, it only uses data, the fruit of the work of men and women and in this logic if fewer people innovate, create and well the ia stagnates or even regresses. The level of general code analyzed from the open access AI gives pitiful results and poisons part of the online documentation and I'm not even talking to you about the quantity of false or useless articles generated.
Accessing voice tools such as this will not only bring out good, there will be a lot of phone scams, identity fraud and I can't even imagine the emotional dependencies that some people could have in chatting with prompts of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.

Afterwards, I'm not saying that it's a regression, it's impressive, futuristic and inevitable, but there are things that should not be abused."
Keep going Openai üöÄüöÄ
Soon I won't need a live companion for a few drinks.
"this is not the voice my chatgpt has! in my head! i think this is cool in theory, but i read way faster than anyone can talk. this would be nice for things like asking chatgpt to read you things, or asking for help repairing a car. so it def has its uses, but i wouldn't leave it on all the time. I think i would use it the most in the car. i like to write lists and think out problems and write down story ideas in the car and it's difficult to do that right now with siri/alexa. also at bedtime, same use - all my story ideas come right when i'm falling aslep, or suddenly remembering i need to do something tomorrow. also bedtime stories."
Coders are crying.
can't wait
Rolling average isn‚Äôt linear algebra
Revolutionary
It's just stating the obvious tho
too bad its an apple computer lol
Wonder what make money online gurus would teach us now üòÇ
This seems to be Jarvis straight out from the Iron Man movies
Awesome. Now let's see what Google will bring today at their event... might define the future of the company itself...
"job stolen, vs"
Congratulations to all ed tech companies üòÇ
"Will the AI company that Apple wants to integrate into its devices be OpenAI, given that all presentations at the event are using Apple devices? Could this be a spoiler?"
"dam, im going to lose my job in the near future as a dev."
Awesome ü§©ü§©ü§©
perhaps the real programming was the friends we made along the way ü´°
"This is like the first Time the Internet was unveiled to us! The amazement, The fears, The Potential and all must go on."
Jarvis?
bruh i just decided to learn coding and to make it my career and my chances are already over before i even started
"This is amazing, I was not expecting this to be announced so early , but it's great to see it in action so early :D :)"
"Gpt casually just dropped a nuclear bomb on us, this is scrary üòÇ"
Can this AI regrow hair on my head???
Awesome!
Will the application be available on Windows?
Her is becoming a reality.
Great
"For the record. I‚Äôm on bots side, I had always been and will always be"
I was born at the worst time for myself
Just thinking about the impact this will have on tech teams delivery timeline
Learning and schooling is going to drastically change.
I also feel like we speak to AI more politely than we would to our co-workers when asking it to do something lol
"impressive, but what open AI is doing with all those data? Are they encrypted, secured, reused?"
Like the NPCs in Pok√©mon always say ... The power of science is amazing üòä
Well that makes my job obsolete
"What are these chairs? I want one.
Edit: It's a Tacchini Costela, 4k$."
"This is just so amazing, we are literally pushing and making the boundaries invisible."
"Yeah, white people are burned, guys"
"To all of you saying this will change this and that etc, yes it's true but you forget one thing. These things will happen only if openai decides to release it to rhe public, they are still a private company after all which, as in every company exists for the sole purpose of making profit."
Demo of Chat GPT 4o ‚ùé How to kick out data analysts  out of job market ‚úÖ
I know it can do more powerful stuff than this
Does it really respond that fast? It needs to be able to return code and other content as well
are u fucking kidding me?!
How to get this app?
start working on the basilisk boys cuz we cooked üíÄ
"People are getting overly excited about it, but it's not that significant of an upgrade. The main improvement is that now you don't need to use Chrome or upload code snippets or images to the GPT website. Instead, GPT hovers over your screen and captures the data itself, and you can guide it through voice commands instead of typing. Essentially, it's just the same thing but with a more convenient interface."
"They are great, I hope one day I can chat with someone from their team."
Have the voice kind of fade out would feel more natural. When interrupting it it just cuts off quick. A real human would kind of slowly fade out in a group setting.
This is marketing at its finest. Happy and diverse people enjoying the tool that makes people even more lazy :)
"Since politicians have run our country into the ground, lets see if AI will save us, lol"
"definitely bunch of jobs will be lost due to the vision cap. you can live show the screen and talk, solve problems etc."
Welp this is insane it can do code analysis and explain it that‚Äôs so cool
I Love they tone she talk with! sounds like my AI gf.
"Sorry, not impressed. The current free version can already do these, you just make it speak."
It's a shame that you excluded Microsoft from this experience. I don't use the crappy coil pilot or the crappy Microsoft assistant or whatever
Insert comment about how much this will change everything
"This changes a whole industry just like that, and it‚Äôs only 2024. I cannot even begin to imagine the future of this tech in even the next 5 years."
I love that AI will do all jobs! Automate everything so humans can spend time having fun and raising families!
"They should show damo of the real life code written by developer in the 2006-2008.

Since migration is the key to achieve this kind of the code. 

How many organisations ready to start from scratch to use generative AI????"
The voice is so realistic; I dont think we gonna need voice actors anymore
"Ohhh boy, contents bout to flood YouTube soon üòÇ"
FIRST!!!11
Will it work in windows too? or is it only Mac?
"I want this ChatGPT 4o inside my house, in my Alexa, in my phone, inside my PC, everywhere. This is amazing"
"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
"ugggh this will make competetive onling gaming a nightmare for developers. imagine this thing helping you spot enemies in shooter games, make strategic decisions in cardgames or RTS games, basically every aspect of online games is cheatable with this tech soon."
Star trek here we come.
When it can make edits I will quit my job and just build.
"Microsoft invests billions into OpenAI, but the first desktop app comes to Mac? What a joke"
"The voice is impressive, and the ability to interpret the image also, even though it had context.
As for the rest however, it's not particularily impressive: the function is easy to understand, as is the math behind it, and the host interrupted the AI before it could answer what would probably have been the harder question."
"Now when I am asking about something chat gpt, it is 60-70% wrong. Example from hour ago, I asked its how implement async react select. It didnt know. Wrote totally absurd things which may be misleading."
Woww another favourite feature‚ù§
what in the word this is literally the future
When will the desktop app be available in the UK?

"Well, I have to say it's just great that they're using a female voice for ChatGPT"
"Why can't they act natural? Def not their fault but all openAI vids are too scripted or people there just forgot how to act natural? This demo is cool but needs a lot more work and improvement for me to actually use it. 

OpenAI, can you open source this model weights?? You can keep the infra and training pipeline to yourself."

Ultimate level would an AI desktop administrator. And beyond."
"So it see's your desktop all the time???  And if AI see's it, tell me who else can see it??  Yeah, thought so, OK, well no thanks, cool and all but ummm, not until it's local, 100% local. I don't mind the AI, but I know it's more than that. this 1984, not 2024,  And yeah obviously if the APP is closed it see's nothing (most likely) but still, local is the big step."
"Do you really need an AI to tell you that this code

Wait till it can watch videos at lightning speeds.
Have you asked it to improve its own code yet?
OpenAI makes answering lame coding interview questions even easier
"As someone who learns with direct feedback for corrections, this will be a gamechanger for many educational needs. I learn in weird ways thanks to my adhd. Can't wait."

"This is suuuper basic. 

Umm, hate to break the news to everyone here but the average code base is like 5k+ lines of code."
"if you forget to mute it, it'll keep yapping?"
2:20 The implications of this are tremendous. People will be able to have the AI watch them do their job all the time - this trove of training data will then be sent to train the models so that in the future they can essentially replace every single white collar job.
"I like that fake excitement about boring task, very american üòÜüòÜ"

"We are in AI Boom. Nice demo and of course very impressive. However, this is still over rated yet a good start for the AI. I still believe these tools will aid us in learning and development but there is a limit to they can actually do. There is too much emotion around AI. Remember, the time when people saw Michael Jackson and they were panting and getting unconscious. This how human react to new things but later those things will become a known and less charming over time. I like to maintain equanimity and stay on the mountain observing."
"GPT 4o is dumbed than 3.5. Significantly. Ignores clear instruction, repeats unwanted things even if prompted specifically to not do so and focus on new topics, and also strays off the topic within 3 messages. It's as if Forrest Gump had ADHD. My question is: why?"
