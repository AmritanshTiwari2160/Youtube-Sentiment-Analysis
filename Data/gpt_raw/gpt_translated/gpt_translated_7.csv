"I guess you still don't understand üòä

The main task of AI is to constantly test, rank, and select all humans in the worldüòä"
"If you watch it carefully, you might not notice even if the AI ‚Äã‚Äãvideo is shown from the beginning."
Can the second half of the video be done with just gpt? ?
Awesome!
I thought today's topic was Jukiya BAN
You can easily tell it's AI because it doesn't hit the camera.
"It's amazing, but I can't really understand what the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis saying.
I wonder why"
How long does it take to learn humor?
"Nogizaka46AI, Risa Unai announcer AI
Thank you.
Please support the AV revolution using generative AI."
"I would like to take advantage of this and have Amazon's Audible read books by Tomabechi, for example. It's more persuasive and memorable. If you look closely, the movements of the mouth, the movements of the body, and the way the spoken voice resonates in the space don't match the senses that humans have, so I hope it's natural as well (sigh)."
amazing! !
"Anyway, it's super fast and amazing"
"It looks like it's not the real thing because it's done properly, but it's a reproduction to that extent."
"I watched the explanation of AI in the second half.
Hmm, could this be a real ""Horiemon""? lol"
Horiemon pretending to be an AI
"If you've come this far, you'll understand how you can fall victim to the scam in question."
Seriously! ?
"There are many different fields of AI, but OpenAI stands out in one. There's also Sora, and in 10 years it will be possible to make Hollywood-class movies with the push of a button."
Now I don't need Horiemon anymore.
"Eh, footage too?"
Is the video also AI?
"This video made me realize once again that emotions, intonation, etc. are also included in the information in dialogue."
The world of science fiction has finally arrived! ! !
"It was AI until 3:17. However, when Horiemon speaks, it often says ""Eh, √ó√ó"", so after 3:17, it doesn't say ""Eh"", so the AI"
Even making a gesture
Second half AI? amazing.
Kolya is amazing! ! All I can do is laugh lol
It's fun to hear Horiemon's honest story. We also refer to the content of the story. thank you.
"Huh, is this serious?"
"As expected, AI felt unnatural ‚õ≤ Thank you very much."
I'm very grateful to be able to learn about the amazing things in such an easy-to-understand way. Awesome
"I wonder if the tokenizer's vocabulary has been expanded because multilingualism has become successful?
I haven't touched it yet, but I wonder how multimodal is implemented."
"You go to so many places, Horiemon lol"
You must be kidding. too cool.
I'm going to lose my job as an announcer.
fear!
The second half was amazing. I'm afraid that fraud will increase.
Thank you for your quick explanation!
GPT-4o is amazing
"In the second half, I can't tell them apart at first glance, but there are still unnatural expressions, eyes, gestures, and ``unnaturalness that hasn't gone beyond the uncanny valley''...

I don't want to hang out with someone who talks like this or makes gestures at incomprehensible times, even if they're a real, intelligent person.
General-purpose AI as a ``substitute for human communication bodies'' will not become a singularity in which people imagine that it is not ``overwhelmingly more attractive as a human being than the smart media people around them.''"
3:17 AI Horiemon starts from here
"AI Horiemon is respectful and nice üòä I don't think they would call him a ""dumb old man"" due to political correctness üòÇ"
"It still feels a little strange, but the technology has advanced so much."
"Evolution is too fastü•∫
We may not even know if various media are taken over by AIüí¶"
At what timing do the hands move?
That's crazy. There will be no need for old people who are local assembly members. Please introduce it to Mr. Aki Takada.
Horiemon unnecessary theoryüòÖ
"In the case of AI, the tone at the end of words is unnatural. There is no pause for breathing, no intonation."
Amazing lol
Aren't we actually the final form of AI? Isn't there a human in the first place?
"Even if the prime minister were made into an AI, it wouldn't be obvious."
"That's amazing...
I majored in information science at university, but I wouldn't realize it unless someone told me it was AI.
If this is misused, the old men and women will be in trouble."
Horiemon is so fast~ üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è‚ú®
Could it be that we are finally in the future where there is no need to seriously learn another language?
"I thought it was talking while reading, but it was an AI.
I mean, seriously? this¬∑¬∑¬∑"
It's completely indistinguishable from reality. Scammers love this
"Also, it would be perfect if you added emotional intonation to the words."
"AI has become a great tool.
I felt that we were living in a period of great change in terms of who would use AI and for what purpose, and whether AI could be used effectively as a tool."
The great times have already come...
"In the early GPT, I made a typo that said ``Afuratsu rich meal,'' but I was surprised when the answer was ``Oh, it's a light meal.''"
I think I can fool a lot of weak people with this üòÇ
"Also, if you can say ""Come on!"" and pose with your hands out in front of you, you'll be a complete Horiemon."
I can't tell the difference between Horiemon and Shinobu Kandori.
"People who don't know this won't understand this.
(^_^;)"
The world is really changing
Why are API costs going down?
"This is amazing, I can't tell it apart"
"I think it's amazing, but it still feels strange.

Difficult to quantify apart from speaking speed and intonation
I felt that the elements were extremely important."
I can't really tell when I set it to 2x speed
Is this real? I can't believe it
"Is this real?
AI? ?
I don't understandüí¶üí¶üí¶"
The persuasive power of someone who is refuted by Yutabon lol
it's amazing
"picture? In the second half, I can't tell if it's real or fake lol.However, if you watch it for a long time, there's something slightly off about the tone of voice.
But now anyone can make videos like that."
People who imitate AI will appear.
It's comparable. Looks like a copy robot.
GPT exceeds the real Horiemon.
"I wonder if the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwon't say ""welcome""? lol"
"I thought Horiemon would move like that, but he has a weird accent lol"
It's amazing
"It's no longer at the level where it's worse to be deceived like this lol
What will happen in a few years?"
I can't really tell the difference üò≥
"Liar, right? ?"
"No, I seriously can't tell it from the real thing.

It's getting kind of scary"
"Finally, there is no need for an announcer."
"What we're impressed about in the second half of this is not so much gpt4o, but the fact that we can now do things like this by combining existing deepfakes and audio generation, right? Matches?"
"After all, AI is different from the real thing and looks like a robot. I can't tell by just listening to the audio"
Awesome
I can't wait for crime lol
"It still feels a little awkward, but I think it will be used for fraudulent advertising."
Fake images using AI may be subject to strict regulations. But I'm really excited that we're getting a little closer to the near future that we see in various anime.
"This or AI is amazing...
My honest impression when comparing the real and AI explanations is that AI is amazing but difficult to understand.
I get the impression that AI mainly talks about performance and functions in a casual manner.
The real thing had a lot of emotion and was worth listening to!
It's the real thing that motivates people to buy.

This may be a future issue for pgt4o, but it made me think about what kind of people are more valuable than AI."
too amazing! I'll make it too!
The speed of evolution is so fast that we can't even imagine the future.
it's amazing! !
What tool did you use to make the second half? ? Amazing
The second half sucks
That's amazing
"AI Horiemon is humble, kind and cute lol"
"Honestly, if I was scammed with this accuracy, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference üòÖ"
I can only trust this channel for Horiemon videos lol
"That's amazing.
It's to the point where it's almost indistinguishable from the real thing."
amazing! Scary before! That's what it feels like.
"I think there will be more cases of information manipulation in the future. If we don't evolve to the point where we can tell whether bills are genuine or false, society will become a mess, right?"
It seems like the recruitment video at the end of the video could be made practically using AI.
Hey üòÆ
"Awesome! !
3:41 Almost perfect except for the ‚Äúreturn time‚Äù"
"In the second half, if I hadn't been told anything, I probably wouldn't have noticed that the video was created by an AI, but as soon as the annotation saying ""This is AI"" is written, why does it start to feel so weird? I guess...the background of the alcove of a traditional Japanese house, the way Horiemon explains things in an extremely serious and detailed way (it feels weird)...lol"
Is it OK that the second half of the video is also AI?
AI seems to apply more foundation.
There is no discomfort at all
I wonder if the first half also has an AI punch line?
"Yeah, is this AI?
amazing.
However, as someone who is inside a steel cage, I feel like the steel cage has been strengthened through data collection and other things.
It only benefits the royal family and powerful people, and it has nothing to do with me."
üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
Is this also a fake video? It's not good.
"There will be no more brain-intensive work.
Automation requires physical costs, and humans will only be able to perform blue-collar jobs that are cheaper."
Blinking is amazing...lol
"Is it like Horiemon who memorizes his lines when speaking? This is so real, isn't it?"
"This is amazing
It seems like there will be more people using celebrities for fraud."
amazing
I don't need the real thing anymoreüò¢üòÇüòÖ
This is seriously indistinguishable...
"It looks like the real thing, but the more I look at it, the more it feels strange, and it gives me a chilly feeling.
Because it's so close to the real thing, I'm horrified by the small discomfort."
"This AI Horiemon‚Äôs eyes are swimming lol
But will things become more natural in the future?
It's scary if there's nothing that can be easily recognized."
"If it were possible to create a voice similar to that of a celebrity, new scams would likely occur. thank you for your hard work."
"Too amazing...
It seems like crazy scams and mediocre scams are going to be rampant.
I'm not confident that I can really tell if I improve a little more."
It was a very thin explanation with no content other than amazing...
"Seriously!
Doraemon is becoming real"
It was so amazing that it made me shiver.
Kenji Haga wants to collaborate with Horie lol
Identity fraud scams will increase
"Sometimes my phrasing and gestures are unnatural, but I've gotten to the point where I just watch what I'm told üòÖ"
Godfather parody is good
I finally found someone to talk to who I am alone.
"too scary
I can't trust people and everything."
"Goddess: ‚ÄúWas it this beautiful Horiemon that spoke?‚Äù
Dora: ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre more foul-mouthed.‚Äù"
I want to see the drunk version too.
This is dangerous!
It just looks real. this is likely to be exploited
AI Horie-san is amazing! Don't let this be misused...
The thumbnail is the idolmaster lol
It's amazing how you can use it.
The way he speaks is as easy to read as Mr. Kishida. I can't feel my heart.
4:35 This is delicious and makes me laugh
"AI is better, I don't need a real person to explain it to me."
Is this voice generated using chatgpt's standard function?
It's human...
"No. When I get a call from Horiemon AI saying ""Hey, oh..."", I transfer the money."
It was totally Horie-san... amazing! ! !
"Ah, is this the time already?
Why would a service that is used for fraud come first?
There must be something else to do."
I feel a little uncomfortable because I'm not breathing.
This is a scam that's progressing.
"I feel like Japan has been left behind for a long time.Everything started in America, maybe it's the lack of corporate funds and talented human resources."
"The second half is too amazing lol
I don't feel any discomfort at all"
It seems like it will be able to talk if you let it learn from videos of deceased people.
"His speech is a bit flat without any inflection, but it's still amazing!"
The lip sync is amazingüòÆ
GPT4o response is extremely fast
3:16 ~ This is amazing
"6:04 ~
Has the accuracy of AI come this far?"
mountains 2ms
"There is no need for high school teachers to teach traditional classes.
I educate teachers through nationwide presentations and lectures at universities, but all the teachers I attend leave blank faces.
I wonder if they can understand a little bit if I show them this video..."
"amazing!
Until you blink (sweat)"
"It's been a great time...
I can't keep up..."
It looks like AI Akira Ikegami will appear soon lol. AI may take on the role of commentator.
It even includes the sound of breathing! I wonder if that will be decided by the AI ‚Äã‚Äãas well.
Scammer: ‚ÄúThis is good.‚Äù
It seems like the profession of being an AV actress will no longer be viable.
Isn't this seriously amazing?
How do you make it?
"It‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs doneüëç"
"When I listen to it with this in mind, I wonder if it can be said that it feels like the text is being read out without intonation. But it's interesting!"
Oh my god
That's amazing...I wonder if the intonation is different sometimes? About
Has it already come this far? 90% natural. Is it an editing mistake if there is no caption? level of thinking
I get the impression that it's only happening in Japan...
Awesome! I guess I'll use it for meaningless university assignments and annoying job hunting... It would be fun to pay for ChatGPT...
Is Horie's Wi-Fi AI?
It looks like the people working at the counter will be replaced.
"A world where ideal handsome men and women can live stream on Tiktok 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and can ask questions, sing, and dance..."
Too harsh...I don't feel uncomfortable at all.
Isn't AI now running the Horiemon channel?
5:10 This kind of movement is dangerous. Human
"Both are too Horiemon! It's amazing!
Maybe even in the future, 100 or 200 years from now.
Maybe today's celebrities are still alive in the world's eyes (¬¥ÔΩ•‚ñΩÔΩ•)(ÔΩ•‚ñΩÔΩ•ÔΩÄ)Celebrities in the entertainment industry seem to be strong~"
"Although their speaking habits and accents are different, they've gotten to the point where you can't tell unless they tell you it's an AIüòÇ"
"If this happens, people who want to make fake videos will be able to do whatever they want. Has the technology for crackdowns caught up?"
"At first glance, you can't tell it from the real thing.
But the emotions, pauses, and intonation are so disgusting that I still notice it.

Just a scholar or someone who speaks in a flat manner.
Moreover, if you are not familiar with it, you will not be able to tell it apart.

The value of talking directly with someone in person increases, and if you don't want to meet someone, leave it to AI.
It would be interesting to have it returned appropriately."
A new version has come out again. It looks amazing and I'm tempted to try it out.
"There are people who believe that this is real, and in a sense it's scary, although it's a wonderful technology."
"Seriously, it's only a matter of time before the voiceover profession becomes available."
That's amazing!
When you can charge the amount with Update...üòÆ
I want to play with it in the high-class Chinese doll I bought last month.
How much of it was AI? The AI ‚Äã‚Äãexplanation was more detailed and easier to understand. Too amazing!
This is already a human...
"No, I don't understand the second half of AI, right?"
"Horiemon's AI knowledge is amazing. Considering that I am a human after all, what Azuma-san said seems important."
"The truth is...the day when it will be possible to have an English conversation partner on par with a normal human being is really close! !

Kolya, yes! ü§ó"
I'm happy to have a friend who will never betray me üòÇ
I wonder if AI will even allow us to talk to people who have passed away.
It's so amazing that I don't understand what it means
"There are only a few videos about the vaccines that were being promoted, right? You've covered all kinds of current events up until now...üí¶You're stubbornly not covering vaccine topics, are you?"
"The AI ‚Äã‚Äãis amazing, but if you look carefully you can tell it's real. It would be scary if I couldn't tell at all."
I was surprised to see that Horie's blinks looked exactly like hers (lol). I wonder if that slow and slow Marisa will change.
"A year ago, I was studying by focusing on the prompts, but the model was evolving too quickly and I thought it was no longer meaningful, so I stopped early. I'm not smart enough to be an AI top runner, and I don't have the horsepower. So a year ago, I switched to a job that requires physicality."
Will the SNS era end?
This is a changing era
Is it the second half AI?
It looks better than the real thing though
Idiots who couldn't study this or elderly people would never be able to tell the difference.
Even the dead will come back to life
2:30
I think it would be profitable to change Horiemon into Gakki and sell it as ``My personal Gakki''.
ÊäïË≥áË©êÊ¨∫„Åå„Åï„Çâ„Å´Ê®™Ë°å„Åó„Åù„ÅÜ„Å†„Å™
Is it really that amazing?
AI is terrible. . . It's too complete
It's scary similar to the real thing.
I was curious!
Can you also make videos? That's awesome.
"It's Horiemon AI, I blew it with"
I guess my laugh lines are unnatural (lol)
The second half was so bad lol...
"I understand because it says it's AI.
I can easily be fooled by this"
"Good evening Horiemon ‚ú®
This AI has scary specs üëç
Honmabi Building isü•µ
Kowarü§©"
"If you let AI learn interjections and occasional mistakes, it would be at a level where it wouldn't really understand..."
"The era of remote work
Dark clouds gather"
"As someone who has lived my life without transmitting my face or voice, I tend to view it in a negative way, so at first I was relieved. In the future, there is a possibility that the world will become one where those who have been exposed are more likely to benefit. For now, I'll wait and see. The change from today is incredible."
"I felt a little uncomfortable, but the quality was no different from the person himself (Ôø£‚ñ°Ôø£‚Ö¢) It was amazing."
"On the one hand, it's amazing, but on the other hand, I can only imagine a terrifying future."
How do you make AI videos like this?
It seems that highly intelligent AI is imitating humans.
Response time (overtime) is a shame.
The intonation of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis a bit off.
There's no point in editing videos.
I'm afraid that the number of fraudulent videos will increase. I want to know how to tell the difference üò¢
"I don't really like this person, but what he says is reasonable, and above all, he speaks clearly and politely. Other so-called influencers are self-centered people who only care about their friends, but Horiemon has a high level of quality."
I don't really know what is real and what is AI. Is AI even used for video and audio? üòÆ
"Emotionless Horiemon AI ""It is now possible to express emotions""
Although I said that I was able to understand the tone of the voice, I laughed at the fact that it was so easy to read and the intonation was strange, but I'm sure it would be natural in English instead of Japanese.
If your Japanese is already at this level, the time when you can interact with AI will not be far away."
"Too amazing!! Ô∏è
About that word"
Real thing?
"It's such a shame AI!
If you added ‚ÄúSo, welcome!‚Äù at the end, it would have been 100 points!"
I'm worried that it will become like the Terminator world üòÇ
"Please say, ``To surprise everyone, I pretended to be an AI and spoke.''"
It was so amazing that I laughed
"It's a bit of a rough read, but you won't notice unless you listen carefully üòÖ"
I can only see a future where fraudulent advertisements increase üòÇ
"Actually, the first half is AI and the second half is real..."
The time has truly come when we can no longer tell the difference.
I want to know how Horiemon made the AI ‚Äã‚Äãvideo!
The quality of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãimages created by Horiemon using Note is low. I want you to use Midjourney instead of ChatGPT.
I want a wagyu T-shirt lol
"If it's my first time meeting you, you won't notice at all."
"If something like this were implemented, most of the content in the world would disappear!"
It is likely to be used for investment fraud again.
Will there be more fake ads for Horiemon?
Seriously amazing
I would also like an explanation of Rakuten's financial results üòÇ
"amazing.
But I guess there's no pressure like the real thing."
"You can tell the true value by the response, ‚ÄúYou should eat vegetables too.‚Äù"
"I feel uncomfortable with the way I move and speak because I understand, but if I didn't understand, I think 90% of people would believe me."
scared
"no longer fake
Clone Horiemon"
This Horiemon AI... it can't keep up with the times anymore.
This is really bad! !
"In the second half, only the mouth and voice are AI."
"‚ÄúPlease use the same enthusiasm when talking about Rakuten Mobile.‚Äù
I wouldn't be surprised if this was expressed."
"Just a few years ago, people used to say that CG humans were creepy because of the ``uncanny valley,'' but over the past few years they have become truly natural-looking."
It's more useful than Horie's emotional theory on SNS.
This is dangerous.
„Éâ„É©„Åà„ÇÇ„Çì„Åå„Åß„Åç„Çã„Åæ„Åß„ÅÇ„Å®ÂçäÂπ¥„ÄÇ
I also had enough time to use it for work.
"In the second half, the way he talks is a bit like reading, but without the captions, you can't tell it's AI at all."
"It's true that I won't understand unless you tell me. If you ask me, I feel a certain sense of discomfort, but we are living in a frightening time. Will humans be able to properly control this technology?"
"The ending of GPT4o is said to be suspicious.
Unexpected punch line lol
I can hear ""Geepee Tea Forest""
There are several places."
"Rather, the first one is AI."
"This was really AI...
I saw it in a short story, and I thought the person himself wrote it to the AI..."
"If I said something like this, it would be considered an occult story, but I can kind of understand when someone is talking to an AI. I don't have any emotions, or rather, I'm not emitting anything at the brain wave level. It's called kotodama. Also, in martial arts, people talk about killing intent, and I think people understand words through things other than sound vibrations."
"Summarize the main points using AI and let AI speak

"Well, it has nothing to do with my life as a dispatch worker (lol)"
"amazing. It's so amazing that I get scared.

I want it to be used for good, but
It is likely to be used for propaganda or to trigger a war."
4:36 There is something strange about the face. The way you use your fingers is realistic.
The blinking of the eyes closely imitates the real thing lol
"what is this, it's amazing"
I'm already scared...
"teeth? what's this
Seriously, how can this happen?"
I don't need him anymore
"Enjoy your life you guys
Human roles disappear"
It seems like all humans can do is eat and have sexual activity.
AI is fine now.
"The way the AI ‚Äã‚Äãspeaks in the second half is like a student's PowerPoint presentation.







The quality is higher than mine"
4:40 Worldline Horiemon who can only read scripts
This is really amazing and the speed of evolution is beyond imagination üòÖ
Horiemon is just a professional surprise-monger after all. I guess that's what happens when you have a low educational background like Horiemon.
AI won't tell you to come.
OpenAI is amazing because it's like sora in a year.
"The audio and lip sync systems are different technologies from GPT-4o, so many people think they are all GPT-4o functions because they were combined."
Scammers will definitely use it
"No, when things are this real, only evil thoughts come to mind."
"Well, it's a double-edged sword.
If misused, remittance fraud is likely to increase."
Panee
I'm using it now and it's amazing
"I still feel strange about AI. It has become a lot more natural since a while ago,
Maybe it's because my eyes have gotten used to it, but the level of discomfort hasn't changed."
"Human beings are completely defeated because we don't understand unless we are told, and even if we are told it is difficult to understand üò≠"
Amazing lol
"By the way, this is the real Horiemon, right?"
"Awesome
It feels a little strange at key points, but you won't understand unless they tell you it's AI.
Seriously amazing..."
"In the second half of the AI, if you eliminate the small discomfort of the images, you can really only tell whether there are emotions or not.
Egg"
This is not Horiemon AIü§£
"Horiemon, an AI that doesn't seem to have a dark heart."
"It's still unnatural because there's no emotional intonation.
This is enough to deceive people"
Scammer: ‚ÄúMorotade! Horie!‚Äù
"I think the code generation has become better now as it is less likely to make mistakes.
I'm an amateur so I'd like to hear a professional opinion."
I see.
Horiemon's AI was so good at acting that I almost got fooled...Ahaha...seriously?
"AI that can endlessly answer children's curiosity. If you were exposed to GPT when you were a child, you would absorb a tremendous amount of knowledge, and your ability to concentrate would improve as well as your curiosity. My eyesight deteriorates though."
too much
"I knew the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwasn't real because it didn't say ""...so, welcome!"" at the end lol"
"Wow, this is amazing!
I was having a headache from too much analog work at work today, but watching this video made me feel betterüòÜ"
"too amazing. Of course, it's possible to create a scam, so that's dangerous. Real information will always be true, so reality becomes more important."
"Well, it's fast, but I've gotten used to kotomo."
"I was surprised, this is"
"If you were listening to it at 2x speed, you wouldn't notice itüòÆ"
There are certainly no errors to the point where I think it's the real thing. Sometimes I wonder if I'm blinking abnormally often...
"I don't really understand it, but you should at least improve your reading comprehension! üòÇ"
Horie is better than Horiemon
Yaba
It doesn't bite at all. Is it obvious lol?
"Eye movements, body language, timing of speaking and movement
It still feels weird, but if I think of him as that kind of person, I guess it doesn't feel weird..."
4:32 You suddenly stick your face out lol
"In the old Ghost in the Shell (2nd GIG?), there is a story like ``video has lost its evidence,'' but this is happening in the real world.
And with great accuracy..."
"If AI started saying ""Eh..."", we might not be able to tell the differenceüí¶"
Have we come this far yet?
Regulation is necessary because it is the first to be misused.
"amazing!
The intonation of the conversation is on par with the real thing."
teeth! ? ! ? This is AI! ? The level has risen too much.
"There will be a lot of fraudulent advertising again.
There are countless people who can be fooled even by images, but most people wouldn't notice if the sound was added as well."
"Everything from his mouth movements to his body language is amazing. If you don't pay attention to the pronunciation, you can easily miss it. If you include breathing and pauses, you won't be able to tell even if you pay attention. I wonder what will happen in two years. . ."
"People who are fooled by AI's fake advertisements are borderline intelligent...ü§™

"There's also the sound of breathing, so once you adjust the facial expressions, it's seriously hard to tell from the real thing... Wow."
I can't tell the difference.
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãhas a breathing sound so I can't really tell.
AI is more polite...scary...
GPT4 seems to be talking while watching the contest.
It would be perfect if love was added to AI...
"Wow, isn't that amazing, Horiemon AI?
You won't notice that it's AI unless you look very carefully. .
Is this the Horiemon Singularity?"
"When I hear the word AI, I feel young and uncomfortable!"
It's completely indistinguishable
I tend to lose focus
"Amazing!
A future where you can work from home and have AI attend online meetings!"
Is this video a fake advertisement?
"I've already finished using the translator Pocket Talk, and I was thinking of buying the stock since it looks like it's going to be listed next year, but I decided against it.
Many jobs are likely to disappear with the advent of GPT-4o lol"
"In the future, the job of interpreter may disappear."
Chat gpt will give you more accurate answers than listening to Horiemon's nonsenseüòÇ
Fraud is likely to increase
"Horiemon, who is a real person, is excellent because he explains things in an easy-to-understand way. AI Horiemon still doesn't know how to use actions."
"This is amazing!
All kinds of jobs may be taken away! We may need to rethink the fundamentals of society, which means that people don't have to work in the first place!"
It's finally time to put the Night 2000 into practical use.
Is it a combination of HeyGen and got-4o?

Fraud is on the rise
"Horiemon, what do you think about the relationship between chat GPT and basic income?"
It's getting closer to HAL.
What's really going on that's scary?
"I'm sure the next version will be so advanced that it won't be distinguishable from the real thing.
Let's leave all the work to AI and let humans enjoy their vacation."
Looks like Miki from Parasite
I want Tsunku‚ôÇ to do the AI ‚Äã‚Äãversion.
"You were in Fukuoka for this matter!
It looks like he was on the Jetstar that arrived at Chubu Airport around 12:00 on the 13th!
A customer passed by in front of me, but my customer service was...

I forgot to say it! Damn it! !"
"Even if all radio stations were replaced with AI voices, no one would notice..."
"Hello YouTube‚ù§
Take care!"
"Although there is some discomfort in his body language and gaze, his conversation is amazing."
Even the breathing is recreated üòÇ
Amazing word
"Yoichi Takahashi ``If Horiemon had acquired Fuji TV, it might have become something like Amazon Prime by now'' What is the reason why global IT companies are not growing in Japan?"
"I watched a demo video of GPT-4o, and it felt like it was on par with HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of real-time interaction capabilities. It's about 25 years later than the movie, but even Arthur C. Clarke couldn't have predicted the concept of the Internet. Well, it's going to accelerate from now on."
"The poison has been removed from Horiemon and he is now acting as a perfect human. In a sense, it's even better than the real thing lol"
How is the AI ‚Äã‚Äãin the second half realized?
How can I find out how to download the app? What kind of mark is it?
"I'm coming to Bayside, please eat something (^^)"
The end of compassion üòÖ
What will happen from now on? I even feel fear
I have the courage to travel abroad
"Her lips are moving with the words, amazing..."
"This is amazing, but I think it's also an invention that is contributing to people becoming more and more insane."
"Meta is overjoyed
You can make money with advertising again üòÖ"
That's amazing...this is deceiving.
"I can't tell the difference...
If we don't seriously think about how to use AI, we will truly be left behind."
This guy got it
Too amazing!
The day when AI will be able to apologize to Otani is coming soon. I don't think I'll apologize until then though! Ô∏è
"What that. Glutamyl transpeptidase, a drug often found in liver tests

Horie Chiyan, I'm stupid so I don't understand, Horie Chiyan. I'm your senior at the University of Tokyo, after all."

"Too bad, I can't tell the difference between AI and the real thing."
"My life, my life, I'm writhing in agony"
It's a fake if you don't get mad about vegetables
"Eh! ! !

This is too amazing"
"What will it be like in 10 years at this level in this day and age, including Sora?"
"Really?
Indistinguishable from the real thing at all!"
"I wonder if this is enough for phone support etc.
If you can reply within 0.3 seconds, this is fine."
"This is AI. No, that's a lie"
"Horiemon in the first half feels strange, so maybe it was AI?"
It's even more blurryü§™ü§™
"The theory that teachers are unnecessary is progressing.
Until now, there has been an argument that it would be better for popular teachers to teach via video.
From now on, even popular teachers are no longer necessary.
AI Horiemon should teach the class."
"Even though this is AI, it doesn't look like AI at all.
When I watched the demo, I noticed that they had the same facial expressions, eyes, and movements, which made me feel uncomfortable."
"00:00 Genuine Horiemon

Is that so
"""Eh"" doesn't come out at all, so it's not him."
This T-shirt that parodies The Godfather is so coolüòä
"*In the second half of the video, the technology announced by Open AI today is only used to summarize the content of the talk."
"AI is rapidly evolving.
General people's awareness is slow.
I feel that this technique is perfect for elderly people as well.
It will be helpful to receive your frank opinions."
"GPT4o is seriously too harsh
Many Japanese people who cannot tell when a lie is a lie will continue to be deceived in the future."
"At this point, it seems like it won't be possible unless the law is put in place. Even in the case of crimes, it seems possible to use AI to disperse crimes."

"If you fix the behavior of the eyes and the speech that doesn't have human tension, it'll be hard to tell."
He speaks more fluently than Horiemon.
The ship arrived in good shape lol
We are now in an era where it is up to people to decide how to use technology.
This is manual subtitles for AI videos. I wonder how you feel about adding subtitles lol
Too dangerous
"If the unnaturalness of eye movements disappears, wouldn't it be difficult to tell that it's an AI?"
"No, it's weird, I thought it was funny in some places so I blew it üòÇ"

"I didn't know anything about AI because I was just watching it in the car, just glancing at it. I thought it was like I was watching a competition, and the way he talked about it was like a projectüòÇ"
"I think it's often useful in business situations, but in the entertainment field, the more human-like you become, the more exciting it becomes. Even if you watch this AI video, it's boring if you think of it as a machine after all. I think the entertainment field will eventually go back to being real people."
The world of science fiction
"When it comes to AI, I can‚Äôt get into the content‚Ä¶ it makes me sleepy üò™"
It's so harsh. More and more people will be fooled on Facebook lol
"amazing...! If you don't have the ability to see through it, you're likely to be deceived."
Become immortal
"ChatGPT is amazing, but Horie is even betterüíï"
"amazing. I seriously don't understand
You can do something like the ""Ore Ore Horiemon"" scam. Are laws and regulations to protect AI morals being cracked down on?

I'm really looking forward to the future"
"There is a slight discomfort in the way you move your face, your line of sight, and your expressions, but this discomfort will disappear within a few years."
This is too bad
AI Horiemon in the first half is amazing
"Mr. Horie! ! I don't feel any discomfort with this ""AI Horiemon"""
It's too amazing... I need to master it quickly.
"It's been over a quarter of a century since I first learned about AI and started making it myself. As expected, you can immediately tell that this is an AI..."
This would be fine for counter operations at city halls and hospitals. It's good to be able to receive the same service nationwide. It's troubling that the people working at city halls in the countryside aren't updated.
Has His Excellency been possessed by a demon since the second half?
"AI feels weird, so if you know about it, you'll know."
I like the AI ‚Äã‚Äãexplanations because they are softer.
Wow...I thought it was Horiemon being made to read the manuscript until I noticed...!
amazing
I can tell it's still barely an AI.
"AI, maybe Sharon Apple from Macross Plus will no longer be a lie...
But the intonation is a little weirdüòÖ"
"In the future, people will think that someone who speaks without hesitation is an AI.
If AI were to make mistakes or speak, it would be difficult to distinguish it from humans."
"The sudden, stupid old man, Warota"
AI gentle tone
Thanks dear
I don't need Horiemon anymore.
"Isn't the current generation AI too specialized in art? It seems like if you make them solve math, it's no good at all. Even though it's a computer...I don't think artificial intelligence will ever surpass humans unless this area is cleared up."

"For now, I'll try making one starting from Akira Asada."
AI is amazing! Even the breathing is real
"This is seriously amazing. I use it every day, and I thought it was the biggest upgrade since MyGPT."
YouTubers' apology videos and daily posts could also be completed using AI.
"3:17 Horiemon is getting closer to Doraemon, which is the origin of his name lol"
"It just feels like an investment scam (lol)
Rather, I felt like I was being shown a wall that humans cannot overcome."
Hori AImon is enough.
Horiemon talking helplessly after being taken hostage lol
"The audio is a bit unnatural, but the video that captures the habits is amazing."
"Actually, both of these are AI..."
It seems like we can talk forever between GPT-4o and GPT-4o.
"The AI ‚Äã‚Äãvideo is amazing, but it doesn't seem to be able to express Horie-san's inner feelings.
Well, it seems that we are now in an era where photos, videos, and audio are all difficult to use as evidence in trials.
Rather than finding reasons not to use it, it would be more in the public interest to repeatedly use it and cause non-fatal injuries."
"Beautiful Horiemon...
Unless you're an edgy person, you won't be able to tell it apart from AI..."
It's a very scary time üò±
"AI Horiemon is so realistic that it feels like he's desperately saying the words he's memorized, so it's funny"
The best time has come
This is crazy! I can't tell the difference! w
"In the future, if you think, ``This Horiemon is a bit choppy and blinks a lot,'' will it turn out to be an AI?"
"This slight discomfort will be corrected little by little, right? It would be awesome if this materialized"
"The emotion of anger is necessary to be a human being, but can you raise your child to be a person with a rich spirituality that is separate from emotion and can handle the wasted time of anger on their own? seems to be a future issue."
"If you just listen to the voice without watching the video, it will sound like a boring, uninflected reading. Is there room for improvement in the details?"
Is the hormone theory that AI pretends to be a good idea?
"Hmm, I guess Horiemon seems to be interested, and there's no talk about API, and I don't have any talk from the perspective of a paid member, so I can tell it's not Horiemon."
Too amazing! I don't understand this
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãversion is very calm Horiemon lol
"If you listen to it at 1.5x, you can't tell the difference anymore."
Letting AI earn YouTube playback time lol
I thought I would definitely handle it.
That's outrageous
Are the human parts of Horiemon in the second half also AI? Lip sing is perfect
"It would sound more serious if there was an ""eh"" or ""well"" between conversations."
Theory that Horiemon is not needed
"It's been quite competitive with Claude3 ops. From what I've been feeling since the morning, it looks like gpt-4o won by a narrow margin."
How do I make this?
"than that
replicon vaccine
I want you to talk about it."
I think it would sell well if I sold it using Horiemon's finger puppets.
"Finally, is it really AI? I feel angry at myself for thinking that üòÖ"
Is this AI image also created by AI?
"Assuming that the audio is ChatGPT-4o, I wonder what kind of generation AI was used to create the images that move along with the audio."
"This isn't because the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis amazing.
The person who made this video is amazing"
Even reproducing the breathing... it's amazing
"It's amazing, but... it's full of bad feelings! Rarely, if you don't make it meta, it will fly..."
This is dangerous
It's true that eating vegetables is delicious.
Oh my god lol
"There's a huge difference from Horiemon himself speaking, and he can't even say ""welcome"" at the end of the comment.
AI cannot bring out the charm of the person himself."
Really awesome! ! It's scary amazing! !
It looks like announcer and call center jobs that only involve reading manuscripts are going to disappear!
AI Horiemon is definitely amazing. But you can still tell the difference.
Rakuten's financial results have been announced. Please explain!
How we were manipulated by the speaker. Did you understand lol
"Wow, the video is so amazing I can't believe it..."
‚ù§
"It's really amazing!
If you use it in the correct way, it can be very useful.
On the other hand, it seems like there will be people who abuse it, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to tell them apart."
"It may be the latest AI for us ordinary people, but it seems to be a technology that has been used at the core of the military in the United States and Russia for about 30 years...We ordinary people are always provided with hand-me-downs. So üòÖ
...So it seems that today's military is using even more amazing technology. .

The other day, a salesman at a large company told me that, instead of using tablets, they have developed a device that displays an image that stands out in space and changes the image by brushing it away with your hand. I'm doing itüòÆ
It feels exactly like something out of the movie Iron Man.

Now, if we calmly think about the fate of humanity that relies on AI, it seems that eventually humans will stop thinking and what AI says will become the basis of their actions, and the ego will disappear. .

Eventually, Elon Musk's technology will separate the consciousness from the body.As Musk's technology progresses, the body will no longer be necessary...I can imagine that if we don't turn off the power, we'll be trapped in a never-ending world. . ü§î
META, virtual, etc. Is that really the ideal world?"
"A truly indistinguishable level. By the end of this year, we'll probably be flooded with videos of AI talking like this. ."
"Looking at the announcement of the number of new insurance applicants in the US the other day, the majority of applicants are concentrated in New York and CA, and the occupations of the unemployed are concentrated in brain workers such as programmers, and the number of job openings has decreased significantly. I am. In other words, in the United States, there are actually no AI jobs for brain workers such as programmers. On the other hand, looking at the number of job openings in Japan, it is not decreasing and it can be said that the transition to AI is not progressing at all. I would like to hear a detailed explanation of the current state of the transition to AI in the United States and the delay in the use of AI in Japan."
Better than you
üò± Too amazing
"You can only judge whether it is an AI by not picking it or biting it! !
So in the second half, this is AI."
"It's amazing, but scammers will use all sorts of tricks to deceive you, so you have to be more careful about feeling uncomfortable than ever before."
Scammers are thriving!
Is it advertising?
"If you look closely at Horiemon, you'll see that he has an aggressive hairstyle."
Is it a characteristic of AI that there is no inflection in the way they speak? .
"When I read the second half of the sentence, I thought so lol I wonder if they are investing in Openai?"
"Hakata has such beautiful places.
It's like Korea."
Horie-san is just reading the competitionüòÖ
What service or AI can I use to create the video of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãtalking in the second half?
Will you continue to live even if your lover dies? ? Isn't it great?
Theme ‚Äúhuman‚Äù can be created by checking the rating
It's so amazing that we should pass a digital regulation bill and go back to paper insurance cards.
Horie's Wi-Fi is starting to look like an AI video.
AI seems smarter. It's a robot after all.
"The only movement of his eyes is that he isn't looking at the camera, but other than that, there's nothing suspicious about him. . ."
picture? Is this fake? ? ?
So cuteüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ
"picture! picture! ! Too amazing!
This video is no longer evidence."
‚Ä¶I do not understand.
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãlooks grumpy.
"This is amazing.
There are still some strange movements, but
If it doesn't say that it's an AI on the screen, I'll just assume it's the real person."
"Previously, the video was ``Basically unnatural, but sometimes it looked like reality,'' but this time it felt ``Basically real, but sometimes it felt strange.'' Too dangerous lol"
"Hakata city is in Fukuoka prefecture. Mr. Horie, have you ever been to the Old Inunaki Tunnel, a famous haunted spot in Fukuoka Prefecture that was made into a movie? Is there one?üòÆ"
Is this why they have strengthened their crackdown on fake news? Consent.
"Wow, if you lower the image quality to the lowest level you can see it's real. ."
"Yeah? Is this really AI? ? Is it possible to do something like this in terms of voice quality, speaking style, movements, and facial expressions? !
I never expected the world to change so quickly...I wonder what will happen to the world from here."
Have you thought about the text? yeah? I can't catch up
"It was my first time watching Horiemon's video, but in the second half there were ads like a phone book, which made me laugh."
People who know Horiemon through casual reading will find the conversation strange.
"This is also AI, right?"
Fraudulent advertising is progressing
highest & highest
"It can also learn and output the person's eye blinks, mouth movements, word endings, hand and neck gestures, etc. Even if there are still some unnatural parts left, I'm sure that will be resolved soon, so I wonder how a third party can judge whether an image is AI or reality.
It's an amazing technology, and I don't think it can be stopped, but I'm concerned about how laws will be put in place in case it's misused. Fake advertising, incitement, fraud, pornography, anything is possible."
"AI Horiemon is crazy, I seriously can't tell the difference...I feel a bit strange in the intonation of the voice, but if I change the sound quality or change the pitch a little, I won't be able to tell."
"Wow, that's crazy‚ùó I wonder how they made this Al video!? Ô∏è It's obvious how great GPT4o is when a normal person can compare it!! Ô∏è As expected Horie-san!! Ô∏è Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"There is almost no change in the breathing rate during voice production or the speaking speed. I don't bite anymore. It feels strange, but you won't understand unless it's called AI.
It's not just a matter of portrait rights, but rather individuals themselves will likely be turned into data.
I wonder if there is a digital watermark in the data created by AI so that it can be identified as AI."
Horiemon looks like he's being blackmailed into reading it. too amazing.
I've never seen Horiemon talk so politely. (‚Üê second half)
That's amazing...I don't need a school teacher...
"It's amazing. I think people who aren't interested in AI don't even know that things like this are becoming possible more and more, and they don't question what they're saying even if it's fake."
"Horiemon is the one who talks about Rakuten with a grin, and AI is the one who talks calmly."
scary. This technique is dangerous
"Interesting comparison with AI Horiemon
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãno longer feels strange, and the information is concrete and persuasive, to the point where it's safe to talk about it at a general meeting of shareholders.
However, the content of Raw Horiemon is easier to understand, and I'm sure he speaks in a way that even an idiot can understand."
"What's scary is not that Horie is the one who can make this, but that anyone can make it.
Of course, I can dictate the content of the talk, and conversely, if I can just think of what Horie might talk about and make it into a video, I can do that as well.
Many argue that it's obvious that we don't need YouTubers anymore, so the value of ""characters"" remains, but it's only a matter of time, after all, characters can still be created.
If you tell them to create a character that will be popular, they will even create that for you.
This is what smart people say when they say that humans have no value and that it's less likely that humans aren't AI."
"It will be safe if you don't give it personality or authority. On the other hand, if you give it the other way, the human position suddenly becomes questionable."
"Apple seems to be introducing GPT to iOS, so it looks like the era will come when Apple will dominate smartphones.
Android ^^"
"This is crazy
I felt a little strange along the way, but I'm mostly human.
I don't need humans lol"
"In the second half, it would be more convincing if they told me that it wasn't actually AI...lol
Is it possible to do lip syncing and gestures so naturally... no, it's definitely used for fraud... lol"
Real Jarvis is almost here.
We don't need an announcer anymore.
"After all, the generalization of this technology is terrifying, and the ability and ethics of those who receive it will be tested."
"Please don't let me say ""Come on!"" üòÖ It's scary in many ways. After all, a real person is better."
It would be convenient if I could have an AI like this do my work presentations.
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãvideo was 10 times more amazing than I imagined.
"Do androids dream of electric sheep? Human or AI? The AI's eye movements are a little weird. No, maybe it's because of preconceived notions."
I want a boxing battle with Hiroyuki.
"That's really bad, are there really going to be a lot of unemployed people?"
"If you say AI, it sounds like AI, but unless you say it, you won't notice."
Indistinguishable from the real thing. It's really amazing.
"Hey hey, this is really amazing..."
"Human Horiemon has a habit of saying ""Eh..."" at the beginning of each word, so people who are familiar with it can tell it apart."
Let AI Horiemon manage Livedoor management.
"I usually do freelance web design using chatGPT.

Until now, there were many unclear points about chatGPT when creating content, and to be honest, it was unusable.

I've only used it for one day, but here are my impressions:
""Maybe what I'm doing will be completely taken over by chatGPT next year.""
That's what it feels like...

I was surprised to see that the output speed increased by about 10 times, but what really surprised me was the accuracy of the Japanese.

I can't quantify it, but I think my Japanese has become about 100 times more natural than before.

It was a day that made me keenly realize that I too need to start another business."
3:17 Hello you look so disgusting
All I can say is that it's amazing. I can't tell this from the real thing üòÆ
I wonder if I can also do translation work?
That‚Äôs scaryüò≥
What a time!
"You can't do business without actually meeting people and having a conversation with them looking at each other.
This is scary. I can't even trust the phone."
I see. Now I know how to make it. thank you.
"I don't think it would feel out of place at all if you let your child learn to look at the camera during greetings and closings, such as ``Hello everyone'' or ``What is...?''"
"I was surprised that the AI's tone was just like Horie.
Maybe if it was on the radio, I wouldn't be able to understand it anymore.
It seems that radio can be replaced by AI as soon as possible."
Welcome üåÄüòÜüåÄ
"Analog work is still a long way off, but with digital work, people no longer need to work under stress.
The digital masterpiece AI completely incorporates human interfaces (visual and auditory).
In terms of processing power, it not only exceeds that of humans, but also (language, knowledge, grammar, voice, body language, images).
They make decisions on their own and communicate using expressions appropriate to the other person."
"It's all a dream, what I see in my dreams
Even this life"
I still laugh at the extremely shallow information
"I'm the type of person who is okay with it as long as I'm good, but I'm glad that Horiemon-san seems to be doing well."
The last AI Horiemon is so scaryüòÆ‚ù§
3:43 response time lol
A dull old man's partnerü§£ü§£
"Eh, isn't it really amazing lol?
Once the second half is shown, it's over"
"It's amazing to the point where it turns you upside down.
We no longer need average to low-quality teachers, instructors, and instructors."
That's excellent
It's almost perfect with breathing space.
The importance of face-to-face meetings has increased.
o is for vegetable.
More and more idiots are being used as tools that have given up on thinking.
"Indeed, unless someone told me it was AI, it would look like the real thing and the way it spoke would be difficult to understand.
If it becomes possible to express intonation, facial expressions, body language, and even quirks in the way we speak, will we leave free streaming to AI?"
"Gradually, humans will no longer be needed."
"Things like this are left up to each person's own ethics, but humans are weak against desire."
I was surprised that it even included breathing.
"Isn't audio supported yet?
Is the API supported?"
"I thought it was amazing, but it might be nice if there were irregularities like the one where the AI ‚Äã‚Äãgets sleepy and the waves of conversation that break up from time to time in the real thing."
"Wasn't Horiemon a real person...üòÆ

I didn't know what AI was...üòÖ"
"As I was listening, I felt like Mr. Horie was reading too much, so when I looked at the screen, I was surprised to see that it said ""*This is an AI""!"
"It must be a lie! If that's the case, I'd like the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto decide to say ""So, welcome back!"" at the end lol"
"The ending doesn't sound like Horiemon at all, just the tone of voice is similar."
"You can tell it's an AI because it stands still and speaks.
I have to fidget. (lol)"
I blink too much and the image looks strange. There wasn't much difference in the sound except for the slightly less smooth tongue. üòä
Almost the same as AI...
Fraud is accelerating
"yeah? This isn't the last video deepfake, right?
Maybe it's just that the text was written very close to Horie's? And other than that, it's just him, right?
With the currently released AI technology, there is no deep fake that can move hands so well, and although the voice is weak, you can tell it's different because it contains noise. realize the misunderstanding"
"Horiemon is more emotional.
AI is quiet"
"If this was played, I'd think Horiemon was talking."
"If you look closely, the movements of his facial expressions seem unnatural, but the muscles around his mouth have become much more natural than before.
it's scary."
Yay! ! amazing!
Awesome üéâ
It didn't change much
"Seriously, this is terrible üòÖ"
"Rather, Mr. Horie on the AI ‚Äã‚Äãside does not stagnate."
It seems like the internet world will be full of scammers.
It feels strange ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm glad I'm Japanese üéâ
too amazing
This is deceiving üòÖ I hope it doesn't get abused!
"Oh, amazing. . ."
I recently signed up for GPT for the first time. I guess I'll try playing with it later.
Politics can now be done with AI. Thank you to the Liberal Democratic Party for everything üòâüëçüé∂
ChatGPT4o has not released audio yet.
It's a person from the past.
"If I could reproduce the strength and weakness of words in important parts, I wouldn't know anymore."
"As a security measure, it seems like there will be a standard feature for humans to tell AI to identify whether it is AI or not, and the singularity will come when it no longer can do that.However, it seems like the better the performance, the better the recognition will be."
"I would give it around 80 points because the intonation of the voice is strange. But if you fix that, it'll be perfect."
"When I asked GPT4 himself, he said Optimize."
"I haven't tried any AI-based products that have been able to understand Japanese or English properly at normal conversation speed.
You must speak slowly and simply so that it is easy to hear.
YouTube's automatic subtitles are too much."
I have a keen sense of smell when it comes to topics like this.
"Seriously...
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãin the second half is terrible...
I've been listening to it at 1.75x recently, and I can't really tell the difference..."
"Is this AI video also glt4o?
It's definitely different, isn't it?"
5:20 I only say general things.
singularity
"I lost to Yutabon in a wrestling match and my very existence was taken over by the AI...
I'm sad"
I think scammers would enjoy this the most.
too cool.
"A.I. You can copy the voice, but you can't copy the facial expressions... huh‚òÜ"
That's amazing.
"I can't tell the AI ‚Äã‚Äãfake monster apart, it's too amazing!!"
terrible
"The faint uncanny valley that remains, with the feeling of humans being taken over by computers, feels like watching a classic science fiction movie, which is really cool! I would like to see Boston Dynamics' robots equipped with this AI."
"I thought that such real-time response would be available in 2028, when 2nm and 1.8nm semiconductors would be released, but I never expected it to be available in the first half of 2024..."
"2063 Novita: ‚ÄúWow, Horiemon is dead!‚Äù
Japanet Takata: ""Don't worry. Our Horiemon AI uses special deep learning technology to perfectly reproduce Horiemon. Now available at a bargain price of XX million yen during the Horiemon memorial campaign. Customization that doesn't say bad things about (ry)"
Even Horie's WiFi commercial was created using AI. That's too amazing
I wonder about the development speed. I wonder if something even more amazing will come out soon?
It's a good time
An incredible technology has been born. Humanity has reached the next stage
We don't need people stealing wages.
"I was born in 1950, but I can't believe this isn't him..."
"From now on, there will be a greater need for the ability to see through people. I have a feeling that if you don't trust yourself, instead of depending on others, you won't know who to trust and you'll be forced to do whatever you want. Conspiracy theories have also become more active, which is a big deal."
This is a level you wouldn't notice if you were drunk lol
"There are so many people who can't tell the difference, it's shocking.
There are so many blind people in this worldüò®:;"
It's starting to be fun
"I'm sure it's amazing, but...
Focus on more useful things
I want you to include it!
When will you make an AI traffic light?
how long until you die
Do I have to wait for unnecessary traffic lights?"
"Is the video also AI? If so, that's too amazing. Japan is also said to have domestically produced AI, but will they be able to catch up?"
"The AI ‚Äã‚Äãvideo in the second half is definitely amazing!
However, I felt like I couldn't understand what he was saying because he was speaking in a flat and matter-of-fact manner.
I guess that will continue to evolve!"
"I might not know if I didn't say it's a late AI. However, the AI's movements are still very responsive. I don't have any control and I feel bad.
It's definitely better raw ^^"
The announcer is finished
I thought we were going to talk about Rakuten financial results today lol
I sincerely hope that this technology is not misused.
Yay! Yay! We're now in an age where it's okay to let AI summarize and speak for itself.
"I always watch it at double speed, but at double speed, I can't tell it's AI at all. ."
"After all, it feels strange when images are rendered using AI. The audio doesn't feel strange at all."
This is seriously dangerous. I think there will be a huge increase in fraudulent advertisements lol
"The second half also looked fine even at double speed.
How can we make this distinction?"
"People, let's quickly realize that Poutine, Biden, and Kissy are all AI."
The end of the system SI and consulting industry is in sight.
It would be great if it could be used for NPCs in MMORPGs...
yes
It feels like Horiemon is just reciting a comp. The level is much higher than I expected.
This is AI because there is no swearing
"Even if Horiemon doesn't have anything to do with it, this YouTube video won't go around."
I'm looking forward to the future.
Horiemon YouTube should be all AI.
Amazing
"I didn't understand the AI ‚Äã‚Äãat all at first.
I understand that the pronunciation of ""handling"" is strange, but I understand."
People with slightly poor eyesight and slightly impaired hearing will be fooled in the second half.
Isn't it too dangerous? ? It's so amazing it's scary lol
Atsushi Tamura was also surprised.
"In the OpenAI video, there was a scene where real-time translation was being done, and I thought it was amazing how they clearly took emotions into consideration and expressed them through voice! HAL9000 and Samantha!"
"Amazing evolution. It feels strange if you're used to seeing it, but it's hardly noticeable."
Streamed from 3:17 on my smartphone üòÖ I don't think anyone who watched it would notice.
Wow lol
I think there will be a lot more people getting scammed.
I'm really looking forward to what's next. Excited.
"Amazing! !
The world of Perman copy robots is coming."
"It's a bit repetitive, but we don't really need an announcer or a weather forecaster."
I miss the Colonel bug from Metal Gear 2.
Seriously amazing
"Amazing!
From now on, you won't be able to watch the news unless all videos have an NFT tag attached to them to ensure their authenticity.
You can still make money from TI. ."
It's tiring to talk without taking a breather. It seems like it's being read as ``Tired Horiemon'' or ``Possessed Horiemon.'' The real thing is more energetic.
"Awesome.
I still feel a little nervous, but it's become much more natural."
"The real thing has quite a lot of filler words like ""um"" and ""uh"", but the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdoesn't have any of that."
Is this serious?
Is the camera moving a little even though it's AI? It no longer looks like the real thing.
"I want Horiemon to teach everyone how to make money with AI. I don't even have to go to school, it's such a waste."
AI has deep nasolabial folds
That's amazing
"It's dangerous, it's dangerous"
"It's amazing, but if you look closely, it still feels strange."
The AI ‚Äã‚ÄãHoriemon speaks in a boring way so I can tell the difference üòÇ
"That's awesome! Speaking of spoilers, this video is also AI, but most viewers probably don't realize it lol"
What if the first half is AI and the second half is real?
"Did he use AI to make him say it? In that case, I wonder if it's what the person himself said."
Awesome! ! ! ! !
The explanation of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis accurate lol lol
"Sometimes it's funny how they do weird facial tricks, but I'm sure they'll soon get rid of that and become more sophisticated."
The second half is just Horiemon!
"If it's a video with no emotional ups and downs, this is fine."
This will definitely be exploited
This is amazing
"No, no, no, no

It just looks real.
finally
AI has also crossed the line."
Isn't the first half already AI?
"As AI progresses, we will no longer need anyone but the best talent."
Is it made by Omni?
AI is amazing lol
"I knew this would happen eventually, but it's already science fiction...
Programming schools were popular a while ago, but now it's a no-code world lol"
His mouth is moving properly as if he's talking!
"Wow, when I take my smartphone away and look at it, the audio and video don't seem out of place at all."
Can Gpt-4o also generate videos? Can I use my own voice as well? Can you do that?
This is dangerous
I really can't tell the difference
Fraud damage caused by Horiemon fake advertisements is increasing üòÇ
This is it for now. . . No one will understand
"Seriously! ! It's me! It's me! !
Please stop calling me grandma."
"The excessive evolution of robots means the decline of humans.
Is AI really necessary?"
It's GPTo4 (Omni)
"Also, it would be perfect if they started saying bad things about Rakuten."
I wonder if AI can solve the problem of the declining birthrate.
The time has come when it will be really dangerous if the whole nation does not realize that AI performance has advanced to this extent.
"The content of the explanation, the gestures, the movement of the eyes, it just looks real."
All I can say is that it's amazing. I want to meet my grandpa who passed away when I was young.
They won't let me go. .
Software is the reorganization of work. Thank you AI.
This is seriously dangerous if you don't think about your future job.
It's so amazing I'm laughing
I might not understand if it gets between ``er'' and so on. Facial expressions in response to conversations have become the only distinguishable factor.
Is this real? It's so amazing that I have to question it.
The AI ‚Äã‚Äãversion is a perfect copy of Horie-san's way of blinking.
"It‚Äôs crazy that this happened a year and a half after ChatGPT came out.
Evolution is too fast"
3:16 That's a lie...
What should I believe?
English conversation school has started uploading app development.
"Horiemon is really excited in the first half.
In the second half, Horiemon is uninterested in reading the competition due to the promotion."
"Oh no lol
You won't notice this unless you tell me."
"AI is amazing, but it seems like there will be more scam videos lol"
"This is definitely amazing.
You can definitely tell the difference, but if it becomes more sophisticated, it will probably become much harder to tell."
Amazing
"Is it the AI ‚Äã‚Äãin the second half?
I was surprised"
"It's an amazing technology, but human cognition can't tell the difference anymoreüòÇ"
Stop suddenly rolling your eyes lol
Your Excellency Demon Horie?
You can create an AI human with a good face and a good voice and have them interview you online.
I was scared when I opened my eyes
Horie's timing of blinking is terrible.
"It behaves a little suspiciously, but it looks like the real thing!"
"The real thing has a lot of ""eh""s.
AI doesn't have ""eh"""
"people are no longer needed
It's too early"
"Hey, there's almost no difference..."
Hmm
"Oh no, I have to use it."
I don't know what's true in this world anymore
I want to make this using myself as a model.
seriously
"The AI ‚Äã‚ÄãHoriemon in the second half is too scary lol I felt a little uncomfortable with the explanations that sometimes included hand movements, but when I looked at it at a glance, I didn't think there was much of a difference. I guess it's unnatural that he speaks words smoothly and without making any mistakes when explaining things, which is different from a real person..."
It's more polite than Horiemon.
It would be interesting if Horiemon was a material for AI to imitate ü§°üíõ
Don't say anything inappropriate
3:17 This is terribleüôÑ
