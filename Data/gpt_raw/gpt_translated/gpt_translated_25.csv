"Aren't you pushing it too hard? Take care of your health! Of course, videos always take priority over health."
"Jm, I think you like that gray sweatshirt haha^^"
Aren't you posting this because you have absolutely nothing to do? I love you‚ù§
Please solve my electrician problem~~~~~~
"I don't stop talking, I think it's really groundbreaking haha."
"Oh, I was really amazed by the world after watching the news in the morning, but JM watched the video‚ùóÔ∏è"
"As someone else has already said, voice chat is not yet GPT4O. It is a pre-existing feature."
"Ah, Gyu-rae!"
It's Tokyo!! I'm looking forward to the unboxing
It's too slow;;
"4o is scheduled to open sequentially. In the video, it goes back to 4."
"It's slow even without GPT-4o, but it's good. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next 10 years. I think it will be easy to use at this point."
"I also watched this live, and I was impressed by the on-site demonstration. The stock market, including the education sector, was shaken for a moment in real time. It's amazing."
Why are you saying you‚Äôre not going to Japan lol?
"How do I upgrade gpt4o? No matter how much I search, I don't know."
The speed of development is really crazy..
How is ‚ÄúGyeolaeyo‚Äù translated?
"2:25 This is really going to be fatal(?) in our country. Not only does the person receiving the teaching need patience, but the person giving the teaching also needs a lot of patience... Once you start teaching math with GPT-4o, you can now become a math tutor and academy. Etc., the space to stand becomes narrow..."
Why is this person so gaunt..?
"I think you should upload a video to see if this is 4o. Haha, will you continue to leave comments?"
Can I not study English anymore?
You are using an old voice function. The voice conversation function has not been released yet.
Cheer up Jm!
does it speak korean well? can i use it to learn korean pronunciation?
I also have to keep up with the times.
You've found a new companion
I think it's because of the internet speed. I use it in Korea and it is as fast as the speed in the video.
Chat GPT will be introduced to RealDoll.
"Wow, thank you for always JM‚Äôs delightful videos. Please upload often ^^;"
This kind of information video is fundamental!!
It looks like someone talented will upload the Jarvis voice pack on GitHub soon haha.
There will be no need for awkward language learning apps at all.
"Is it possible to use it on older iPhone devices? For example, iPhone 12 or 13 series."
But why. you. You and your wife are together? What's going on?
When will you give me the conch!!!
It's scary „Ö†„Ö†
Do you have a part-time comment job?
@6:40 What is a ‚ÄòMac client‚Äô?
hi? J.M.
He said he wasn't going to Japan. Cheer up.
"I saw this and bought it, but the voice hasn't been upgraded yet „Öú„Öú„Öú Hehe, that's possible."
The GPT-4o audio mode is amazing. I really want to try it when it actually comes out.
"Bro, why did you go to Tokyo again~~üò¢"
"If only I could react faster when speaking Korean, I could now have a girlfriend. .....ü§£ü§£"
20 seconds ago is precious.
"Bro, just upload videos like you do now. It feels just like the old days. It's so much fun these days."
It's very slow
"The moment that smart and efficient artificial intelligence is combined with the defense network, will it become Skynet? ? We need to protect John Corner quickly."
"Haha, it feels like the world is going crazy towards the next level... haha"
This has already been covered in the news
5:20 Why does it look like it‚Äôs slightly scratched? Haha. GPT seems to be trying to say it with a smileüòÇ
"I am someone who uses GPT for several hours almost every day. After using 4o, there are many cases where incorrect answers are given more often than 4. I don't know what the problem is, but if it is correct to say that 4o added a modal, I think there should be no performance problem, but it feels like the level of the answer is lower. They say I'm better at understanding context, but I wonder if I'm the only one who feels it's worse than 4. I don't know how others feel. I‚Äôm curious haha"
Wow...I can hear the phone call agents requiring emotional labor disappearing...How far will AI evolve...
It reminds me of Amanda in the movie. The advancement of technology...
"I've been using Copilot a lot these days, and I can feel the speed of AI development every day. Sometimes it's scary haha."
"Are you using the paid version? On smartphones, the paid version costs 29,000 won, and on computers, it costs $22 including VAT. Does anyone know?"
The reaction speed will improve.
"I'm asking because I don't know much. I heard you use GPT-4o on your cell phone.
It does not appear in the GPT app.
How can I experience GPT-4o? For reference, I have an iPhone."
"What‚Äôs special about this openAI spring update?
1. Even free users can use GPT-4o for 5 times less than the Euro plan. If the usage limit is exceeded, it automatically reverts to GPT 3.5.
2. Korean language recognition ability is improved compared to the existing GPT-4T version.
3. The Korean tokenizer has been improved and the API can be used 1.7 times cheaper."
"Brother, I think the response speed is slow because Korean has slightly more complex letters than English."
JM???
*Just apply chat gpt to the humanoid robot and you‚Äôre done.*
This is free??
Are you getting kicked out and living alone in a hotel room? „Ö†
"It's not that it's not true, but in 10 years, we'll be carrying something other than Siri or Bixby with fast-reacting AI."
"If this happens, what will happen to Galaxy?"
"As the science teacher said, should we fight AI?"
Cheer up üòäüòä
It feels like the future world of the movie HER.
Osmo pocket 3?!
"The translator is crazy.. I hope there is an error
I'm not ready to accept it yet"
And o means omni. It reminds me of the Omnia phone.
"I wondered why it didn't work, but voice recognition doesn't work with version 4o yet. I was also confused because it was made as if it were open AI."
"Since it is AI, the speed of development is definitely at an insane level.. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãthat makes that Sora video is also at an insane level.
All technologies are likely to develop very quickly thanks to AI."
"I'm afraid it's not American, but the way it speaks sounds like an overseas Korean haha.
I wish someone would send Altman some Korean dramas as training data."
Isn‚Äôt this similar to the movie ‚ÄúHer‚Äù?
The code packaging seems to be 10 times faster than version 4.
"I think it would be better to take this video down. Currently, only image input and text input and output are supported, and audio input and image output are not supported."
Have you seen the movie Her? It's coming soon. Now possible with AI
It would be good if you also introduce Chinese AI. Chinese AI can turn even a photo into a dancing video.
"The way I speak is still unnatural,,"
"Voice chat does not yet work with gpt4o. I think what you showed in the video was back to gpt3.5 or 4. Right now, only text and image input and output are supported for paid users and APIs, and the proper release is said to be in a few weeks."
It's surprising that your English is so smooth!
"My heart is filled with joy because my gesture seems to have found my original intention, brother.
I always support you."
What is the app?
"The voice function hasn't been updated, so what are you doing? Haha, it's so cute."
"I think Korean is still too slow. It will be resolved soon, right?"
Please translate Sibelnom into French.
"Currently, the engine can be selected as 4o, but the interactive type, which records voice immediately and plays it immediately, has not been released yet. Nowadays, if you record your voice, you convert it to text and then type it in.
I heard that using it like the demo above will soon be included in the $22 paid version of Chatgpt Plus. Please update the chatgpt app quickly~ It‚Äôs going to be a crazy world."
"Terminator will become a reality soon.....
John Connor is urgently needed."
You're so skinny...
Let‚Äôs watch the video carefully.
It seems like the update hasn't been completed yet. This is a mystery. Why did they not release all the updated features but only some of them?
I think they are wearing headsets somewhere on the planet and answering questions pretending to be AI lol.
"If the speed is slightly improved, it would be like having an interpreter and translator who can speak almost any language on my phone. In about 10 years, language majors will no longer have a place."
The video is so fun haha ‚Äã‚ÄãI like it
Can't you change the title? It's annoying because it's being dragged around.
"I don't think it's wise.
Jm is a strong wallet"
It‚Äôs okay if you make a mistake~
"As expected, it's JM~~ The speed of development is really fast~~"
This guy is so funny that I always see him lol.
I hope it gets resolved quickly. So you went to Japan to pick up the iPad? I‚Äôm looking forward to the review haha.
"Brother, the voice function is the same. It is true that the speed has increased. There was an announcement that an update would be made within a few weeks.

Are the text and images updated?"
J Ae-mu-hyung especially likes the word 'starter'...
"Does this person upload a video without properly checking the information? Once incorrect information spreads, it becomes uncontrollable. Is there a lack of responsibility or something? If you don't have the ability to properly research data, you can just post pictures of daily life in Japan."
"I tried installing the desktop version of Mac OS, but it was blocked."
Where do you stay when you go to Tokyo? I'm planning to go on a trip to Tokyo...how much does it cost to stay and how much does the hotel on the screen cost? It's my first time traveling to Japan...
"The most directly contacted people through ChatGP are translators, interpreters, English teachers, and Japanese teachers."
The world is scary
I feel like I have 10 years left until I no longer need to learn a foreign language.
"The media said it would open partially at the end of this month and sequentially thereafter, so I'm looking forward to it."
Studying foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãis over
"0:15 Puuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
It‚Äôs been a while üòÆ"
"I think it's still a little below the level of conversation that can be made verbally, but it feels good for Koreans because they can see the answer without having to wait when talking through text."
"The actual speed is so slow that it can't be compared to the demo, and the speed is the same as before, so what's changed?;;"
Currently only iPhones are available. Android phones will have to wait a little longer.
gptKorean is the Korean speaking style
"After hearing her dramatic voice, I immediately thought that the movie ‚ÄúHer‚Äù would be possible."
I'm really looking forward to Chat GPT in a year... It's both exciting and scary...
"JM, can GPT-4o be used only on iPhone?"
Was 4o applied to Mac first? It works on iPhone
I just saw that I went to get an iPad.
I think the conversation functions shown today are the original 4 functions and o has not been updated yet.
"Now, when traveling abroad, the GPS app will be essential instead of Papago haha."
I‚Äôm so glad that videos come up often
"By understanding and analyzing the language spoken by the user,
It extracts an appropriate response, converts it into a voice, and outputs it.
If it takes less than 5 seconds, it's really crazy speed."
It's so amazing
How do I download it?
"I was impressed while watching the video explaining the situation through the lens. I thought it could be used in this way as well.
The current performance is also impressive, but Sam Ultman assures that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopment stage is still at the very early stage.
I can't help but pay attention to things other than electronic devices."
I feel anxious every time I stop talking.. Will a human... bug... etc.... stop talking to me? I guess I'll build a stack like this
"You're smiling as if nothing's wrong... but I know how hurt it must be on the inside, bro."
"Fact:!:!: I also saw this on the news, but it is generally useless and of no interest!!!!!"
"It's surprising that GPT speaks with emotion. By the way, he speaks 4 languages ‚Äã‚Äãwellüëèüëè"
Hahahahaha front teeth come out because they can't control their pranks 5:23
It's so slow hahahahaha
"You're working hard, bro."
Now with AI and dating content...
Did she appear?
"Where can I use ChatGPT 4o? First of all, I haven't subscribed, but I only get 3.5. You said you can use 4o for free. Where can I do this?"
Strange....scary
"These days, if you look at Chinese products, the glasses come with cameras or speakers. If GPT integration is added, they will have many uses."
I thought it was a razor when I saw the thumbnail..
Girlfriend is being born‚ù§
It's awesome... „Ö†„Ö†
Wow Jirin‚Äôs
"Wow, it‚Äôs a newspaper article."
"I'm going back to school these days.
Work, etc. If you have this, it will be great for school applications and classes. Is it better than Cheg? It's better than Khan Academy."
"Because of this, Microsoft's stock price, which rose 1% in the pre-market, ended up falling on the news that this feature would be provided for free..."
It's not this version lol
go. Meow... wow...
Technology is crazy
"I love you so much üíö üíó üòò Always cheer up and please make another fun and amazing video like today~
I will always support you"
"Wow, I miss ChatjiPity."
"Just by looking at it, it's only 1, but it's still far away haha. I'm going to go to Ganggi with peace of mind."
"1 year later: Hehe...Ai-chan, what do you think of my expression?"
Still too slow
"Wow... it's so crazy „Ö†„Ö† Honestly, it's amazing, but scary... „Öú„Öú I'm an ordinary person who doesn't belong to the 1%, but I'm scared of what I'll do in the future and that there won't be anything I can do. „Ö†„Ö†"
Why is my face so old... .
I have a professional spirit jm
"What about all the interpreters and counselors? Now, the call center staff too haha."
"Brother, your face is so damaged.
I think I'll be in big trouble if I don't control my medication."
"Ah, it's a poor gesture. The content is good, but please just say it. I'm out of my mind and I can't watch it."
GPT‚Äôs speaking style is eloquent.
It reminds me of the movie Her lol.
5:38 Today‚Äôs view~ Are you careful?!
I feel like the speed of AI development is really fast... I think I'll be carrying around an AI assistant one by one in the future.
"I watch reviews, but I actually watch the video to see JM lol Z~"
"When using an iPhone purchased in Japan in Korea
Can I use the function provided in Japan?
JM, is this possible since you are currently in Japan?"
Unbuilverbull~~
"Jaye Musang, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been uploading a lot of videos these days."
"Wow, I was left alone at work playing with GPT4o and a video popped up right away. Nice to meet you haha."
It looks like a motel.
"If I search on the Play Store, there are a lot of apps. Can you tell me which one I should use to find the real chat gpt?"
Investment AI Chat GPT
How do I download and use it?
Why is it recognized as a foreign language when I swear? I'm disappointed. üò¢
"As a user who enjoys ChatGP, this is good news ^^"
I burst out laughing at the Korean pronunciation.
"Correction) I thought that since GPT-4o was activated for text-based, the audio mode would naturally operate based on 4o, but I guess that wasn't the case.
They say that GPT-4o audio mode is not yet available.
For some reason, text is incredibly fast, but conversation is so slow to respond. What is it? I did...^^;;;
I'm sorry that I couldn't check it thoroughly because I was making it in a hurry. I'll check it more carefully in the future."
"Just a little longer, and a world like the movie SHE... may come."
The Korean voice is not very good... It's too monotonous.
Thank you for good information. You went to Tokyo to pick up the new iPad.. I‚Äôm looking forward to a review of the new iPad as well~~
"You can select gpt 4o, but the voice function is an existing feature... If you have used the voice function of the gpt app before, you will know. The feature patch hasn't been released yet.
The voice function of the newly patched gpt 4o, which appears to have been released in the demo, has not yet been updated. The gpt4o function is only activated to provide a faster response when you ask a question through text."
"I know it was originally on YouTube like this,, thank you"
"The voice conversation shown in the video is a model that was also available in the previous version. There were many people who didn't know, but with this update, many people learned about it."
Wow that's crazy
Nice to meet youüòÅ
The video frequency is also very good. five stars
üòÑüëèüëçüíñ
Hahahaha Cashiki hahaha
"It's strange. I think I got criticized in today's video, but I guess it's just how I feel. Haha"
"I'm trying to try it now, but it says it can't be done because of server overload. It looks like there's definitely a lot of people there.
By the way, I live in Japan and it hasn't changed to GPT-4o. Is it possible that only paid users can use 4o?"
google i/o won
It's not free.
"Due to the 5:50 time difference, it is very late in the evening when it is daytime in the U.S.... It is evening in the U.S., so the speed may be a bit better."
Thank you for the practical experience~! I guess I should try it out hahaü§ì
Is this even possible to predict stock charts?
"When I update my iPhone and go into the app, it says 'Get Plus+' in the top middle. I don't think Korean voice support is available. Do I have to sign up for a paid subscription to be able to speak Korean?"
"After studying a foreign language hard, I came home and saw this video??? üòÇ
Have a nice trip to Japan~"
The problem has been solved. Let me be your girlfriend.
"Hyung, is the auxiliary battery finished?"
"If that can be done in 320 milliseconds, does that mean I don‚Äôt have to study a foreign language? I'm trying to study Japanese, but looking at translators these days, I wonder if there's a difference between studying for months and years and using a translator."
Did you go to Japan again?
You're crazy
What kind of jobs will quietly disappear...„Ö†„Ö†
"Now that I look at it, it's an app...lol."
It feels like something has come to the future in an instant...
"Nice to meet you, Jay Aemusang haha"
The speed of AI development is really incredible... AI isn't going to rule the world like this.
"The biggest regret is that it's hard to use this for a long time because the limit is set too quickly. If it's supposed to be fun, it's limited and they tell you to come back in a few hours."
It seems like an era has begun where human relationships are no longer necessary.
"I'm scared, excited, and looking forward to it."
Your English is definitely fast.
Let's go wild in JM Tokyo with the reins loose^^
I like this kind of JM content. (Feels like the early days)
This is my first time seeing a video of it actually being used. It looks very useful.
Conversing in Korean feels like talking to a Korean-American.
The interpretation performance is crazy...I guess I won't need to learn the language anymore? I guess I don't have to speak English when I travel.
"Hahaha, I watched the whole video and all I remember is Cassidy."
You're back!!! Jay‚Äôs petting type is so sweet!!
"I heard that Google will also make an announcement soon, so I wonder if they are going to talk about Gemini~"
So what is chatgpt5? It‚Äôs really surprising.
"???: Hey, gpt, please tell me your strategy for winning a divorce case. gpt: You recently started the divorce process, right?"
"I was very disappointed with gpt4, but I wonder if it will be any different this time..."
0:15 It seems like you also secretly fart together? „Ö°„Ö°
I think we've reached a point where we don't need a teacher.
Honest test...
"The way he stopped talking was really impressive. It was only last year that ChatGPT became known, and I am really looking forward to the next five years as it is developing so quickly."
"I tried using the Mac client, but it doesn't support viewing the screen yet and often gives me error messages saying it can't respond."
"Ah, I‚Äôm so happy ~~~~~"
"10 years after the movie ‚ÄòHer‚Äô, an AI capable of conversation has finally appeared."
"If that goes over to glasses, real-time interpretation and translation is possible!!!"
"It's still slow. They are a fraud. After actually using it, I was hooked again... Open AI is a scam. You only have to try it for an hour to know."
"I was curious about Gpt-4o, but after hearing jm's explanation, I want to use it more. Thank you for the tech review I always trust. ^^"
I guess you went there to get an iPad haha.
It won't be long before I meet her
"The day will come when useless call centers will be replaced.
It won't be long hahaha even if I ask politely
The other 99% of customers say they were bullied by the 1%.
I hope all the simple service businesses that used to vent their anger will be replaced."
I finally have a girlfriend.....
I think it would be great for language study purposes.
JM‚Äôs voice is really likable haha.
The world is developing rapidly...
"2 months later: After realizing that it was nothing more than a real-time translator, I was completely satisfied with the response."
What day will it be in 5 or 10 years?!
4:00 But does it really have to be a Korean speaking style?
Wow... the translation function seems crazy haha.
The singularity is coming
Galaxy AI is over...
"The new voice mode has not been applied yet
‚ÄúVoice mode will be provided in alpha mode on ChatGP Plus within a few weeks.‚Äù It is said that"
"This is something you introduced in class today, but I remembered it after watching this video, so I will look it up before I go to bed today. Thank you."
I'll listen üòä
John Corner. It's today. It has to come today.
00:15 Farting
"Chat gpt Pressing the headphones to talk is really good for practicing English conversation. It's a shame that it can't include non-verbal expressions, unlike in real conversations, but it's good."
Jarvis is becoming more and more realistic...
"Chet GPT, tell me about your dick"
AI has developed rapidly in just one year...
"Oh, JM, I've been watching your videos for a long time :) However, if you look at the voice talk video demonstrated today, it seems that you set up the GPT-4o model in the app first and then pressed the headphone icon to run it... (I'm also a paid subscriber)... But now. In Open AI, when you run the voice mode, there is a button at the bottom left that allows you to immediately run the camera, but in ours, it seems that it is still paused, so it seems that the new version is not running properly in the voice talk mode yet."
How can I use it for free??
I'm trying it out and there is almost no delay.
"Shiparama, Kesiki haha
I can't believe you show such sense in the middle."
"I'm lonely because I'm living alone in a foreign country, but now AI will be my friend for me haha. If you tell me to speak with a certain tone and act with a certain personality, this is really the best, isn't it?"
It looks like Tass from Interstellar.
