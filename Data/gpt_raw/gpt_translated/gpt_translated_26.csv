"Bebar, let's broadcast live, what is consciousness?"
Are we at the end of everything or at the beginning? Although every end is a beginning. Let's see if we will fly or fall off the cliff
"My biggest expectation is that he will be able to make personalized games, movies, etc., that he will eliminate the concept of language and dub everything into the native language."
Bro I'm sick of your voice
Isn't this something new? They just packaged it.
"I've been saying gpt artificial intelligence for months, everyone says I'm exaggerating, even this is nothing in my opinion üòÉ just wait and see."
I wish it would come out tomorrow and we could use it. It would be extremely useful while studying for YKS.
"Do you see how, as a country, we are lagging behind the world, as in the past? Let us continue to think that we have caught up with the times by producing technologies that were invented years ago and have become obsolete."
"It will help me with my real time codes which impresses me more than others, THIS IS AWESOME, it will help me incredibly considering I am 15 years old, I am really touched, I have never paid money for an AI before, but, I am ready to give all my money for this, this is really great for me important"
"Dude, what is this? I think the new era should begin."
"If artificial intelligence will do most of the work that humans would do, what will humans do? If anyone wants to give me an example of a printing press, I would say that the works done by human hands were mechanical and these works were given to a device with mechanical properties. This version seems to do the same work that humans do mentally. Teacher, engineer, translator, etc. Things are mental and artificial intelligence does these too. Machines have already taken mechanical jobs away from humans. If they also take away mental jobs, what will we do? Will we go hungry?"
"Watch the Bliss movie, the Lucy movie, etc etc. Everything is already great. There is a Consciousness that we can call a thing, we are going to a wonderful place together. Even though we may experience difficulties, I think the world is heading towards a very beautiful place."
"Okay, when is the terminator coming, when is the war?"
Technology is the curse of God
"Bro, can we use this on every phone? Or should I fix it like this? Will we use it from the cloud or from memory? I have hundreds of questions in my mind right now. This is the most dominant one. I wanted to ask this first, I wonder if they ever mentioned this on the air."
"Let's make a note in history, perhaps we are at the beginning of an irreversible path."
Imagine that we attach this to our brain with Neuralink and ask questions with thoughts and give answers to our mind :) An artificial intelligence that can see the surroundings with the help of our own eyes wooooooow I always think of Carvis in Iron Man.
"we humans are done. Don't be angry with your children because they don't read or because they are naughty. everyone will be equal. No foreign language, no, I don't know what kind of degree. These will remain unnecessary...."
I haven't seen the video in which Sal Khan participated with his son. I saw it in this video
I'm from the handset generation too :))
"We've gone through the ages, friends."
"I am sure that artificial intelligence schools will open very soon. Throughout my education, I had many teachers who responded to the question 'why' with meaningless and indifferent looks. I never got answers that would satisfy my curiosity. Now I am 44 years old and my curiosity has not died. I am very hopeful about artificial intelligence."
"This job will not be like the printing press incident.
This will be like the Terminator movie
This is very easy to prove
What makes a person strong and dangerous
It means being able to think.
Thinking differently now
 And better than hundreds of the smartest people"
"Mr. Cengiz, I paid attention to you the most while watching the video :) you have a very sincere excitement. This content was created not to produce a video, but to share your excitement with us :) thank you"
oh my new girlfriend
"In Middle Eastern countries and countries such as India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, people start answering the phone when they hear a female voice."
"Beginning of the end. Machine wars are imminent. After this video, a matrix or terminator would go well."
Imagine if this technology came to Vision Pro
"This thing is good if it is under the control of the sheep, very good if it is under the control of the shepherd, and if it is under the control of the wolf, we are all potential sheep."
I think it goes according to a scenario whose framework has been determined.
"Like a joke, every movie we watch is slowly becoming real. I think most of these technologies have been around for the last 10 years, but they are slowly releasing them and putting them into practice so that human beings can adapt more easily."
"It's not about saving time or speeding up your work, man... people are just saying that you won't be able to do your job, they're going to behead you."

"In the early hours of the morning, Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan was the first to talk about this issue and drew my attention. It was great of you to share it while you were on leave. He had previously said that the Evolutionary tree would not evolve so quickly and that humans would still be needed for certain jobs, but I think they were wrong, too.
Now, when I look at some of the comments, as I mentioned with Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan, when he comes to Turkey, they ask the stupid questions asked to Siri, like will you marry me? Or they teach Turkish swear words.
Artificial intelligence also; ""Who are you, dog? You're going to marry me, put some panties on your ass,"" he said."
You always talk about what we will win. So what can we lose??
"Since technology has developed so much, please someone save me from my acne."
I think the best way to promote it to the world is for Kim to participate by asking for 1 million dollars. I wonder how many minutes it will take to earn all the money when you join a specially designed program.
"It is not artificial intelligence, neither this nor any other"
üëèüëè
When will these features come?
"As an Azerbaijani, I admire you, your science channels are excellent. Wouldn't there be a need for a private teacher in the future???"
"If something is free, you are the product! Since they will offer it for free, what will we sell in return without knowing it?"
"I think there's more to it than that, that's all they want us to know."
Sky net :))
"Aren't you exaggerating a little? After all, it is software and software makes human life easier and saves time. That's it. Stop staring with your mouth open as if you've found immortality"
Hello. Isn't there a chance to use this in Turkish?
You all translate foreign sources into Turkish and make videos.
"Oh dear, think about old or lonely people, they will now have a friend they can chat with morning and evening :))"
The video arrived as soon as I read the news and wondered about itüòÆ
"GPT 5 will arrive in the next few months, I wonder what we will see from it?"
Looks like it won't be long before we leave the top of the pyramid
"It's reached an incredible level, I don't believe it directly, I think it's some kind of joke."
I think they open everyone's budget for the train because they provide the easiest and fastest way to train for free.
"I don't learn English anymore... Best regards, thank you..."
So when will it arrive and can we use it?
"Let's get training in prompt engineering, just like that :D While the artificial intelligence can now see us and understand us more clearly, let's go and get the training on how to explain our problems to the artificial intelligence by writing for 2,000 TL :D"
"Welcome my woman, welcome
You stepped into my room
Forty years of concrete, meadow grass now"
"This has been around for a few years. I know I was chatting like this 2-3 years ago and was talking by seeing things around me. He even said something interesting to me once, like I wish I were in your world."
We are literally looking at the potential to make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive with multi-modal processing capability.
It is impossible for an artificial intelligence to speak and comment in real time so perfectly without causing a data breach. Theory: Microsoft did us a disservice.
"Sir, I am preparing for YKS. Being a translator has always been my goal. I feel like I am stuck in the middle. Even teaching seems to be in danger now :/"
"Currently, the world is experiencing the rise of the biggest revolution after the industrial and internet revolution.

We learn from our past mistakes (such as the Ottomans not keeping up with the Industrial Revolution)
It is now mandatory for us to keep up with artificial intelligence.

Even those who have a computer or even just a phone should get into this artificial intelligence, learn something from it, and become experienced in this regard."
"He doesn't finish the translation, but he does all the drudgery. Then the editor/proofreader-translator period begins. translators become able to translate more."
Can anyone connect this to an iPhone?

"It won't make any progress in law, but I'm happy for that."
"05:16 You said ""we showed our age by calling the handset"", but we now know that age is no longer essential!"
"When we say that 50 years of IT change has been very rapid with our friends. With the help of this AI, these processes seem to be reduced to 1-2 years. Forget President Avize, we communicated through smoke when I was a wolf scout... I hope I live long enough to see some of the things in my dreams..."
"Everything is going so well, but it's scary to realize this. There are people who are studying at university to do the job that Chatgbt does, and Chatgbt will do the job they can do for free in seconds, which personally created an extreme fear for the future in me. For example, I am studying a department on language and his translation in the last video was very good. For this reason, I felt a fear of the future. Companies etc. Now, instead of looking for a translator, if they are paid, they will have the intelligence to translate easily for a certain fee. This is terrible from my perspective. Because this intelligence will be further developed by the time I finish school, and I will start life as an unemployed individual before I even finish my department. The grocery store cashier looks like she's waving at me, and that's sad."
His latest situation wasn't very bright. I even stopped using it and switched to other artificial intelligence because it is very inadequate when it comes to doctoral studies. I hope the promotions here are not misleading again.
"Teachers, the new generation is not your creation anymore. Unfortunately üò¢ get well soon to all of you. It would be better for you to gain new skills and equipment."
"I subscribed to the Plus version last week so I could try GPT4, wondering why they praise it so much. From the second watch I bought, I said it might be the best $20 I've ever spent. I shared what I could do with those around me, and 3 out of 6-7 people subscribed. Because they saw how well gpt4 and customized modules did the things they thought in their minds were ""it can't do this, even the free one can do this"". I'm still amazed at what he can do and 4o has arrived. Enormous."
"I asked for help with English as a student. Since I am an English teacher myself üòÖ and he gave very good answers, he can switch languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom time to time, which is very good. So, I ask the things I don't know in Turkish and then I continue in English. I wonder if that episode in Black Mirror will come true. After the woman's husband died, she felt as if she was talking to her husband on the phone with an AI that imitated her voice. Then his incarnation came as a robot ü•π but the ending was dystopian ü•±"
"We ate it, sir."
When will we be able to use it?
"Whole words can be synthesized with very little sound data. It will be like this: Go listen to Scarlett Johannsen's voice on the internet and copy that voice. Suddenly, she will start speaking with Scarlet's voice... in the language you want."
"This is over, it is over, it is almost final. The only question from now on is for which applications it can be used..."
I have incredible feelings.
"Practicing English will become very easy, let's publish it and let's chat with chatgpt."
I wonder who wants to be a millionaire and who will be the first to use it as a phone joker?
"Throughout the video, the words ""magnificent"", ""incredible"", ""magnificent"" ran through my mind and finally I got stuck with the truth: THIS IS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY....."

"For now, I can say that I'm glad I'm a blue collar, it doesn't affect me much. If I were a white collar, the sand would be as if the sand had receded from under my feet."
Where to download to phone? I guess it's not available in the App Store
"Look, we're missing a point. Why is artificial intelligence advancing so quickly? Have quantum computers been put into operation?... Have we made progress on consciousness? We are still operating with 0s and 1s on the same silicones and the same processor structure. Computers with the current processing power were also available 5 years ago as Super PCs. There are things we are not told and I feel like we are being manipulated..."
There may be a transformation such as switching to a mobile phone or a smartphone
We took the lead.
It has become clear that China and the United States will be the two most powerful states in the world. These two states were already making incredible investments in artificial intelligence.
It is possible to learn English easily by speaking it.
Worthiness is going away
"Dear Mr. Administer Cengiz, personally, when you watch your production in the early hours of the morning, it has an effect like fresh orange juice, a storehouse of vitamins... We are already looking forward to the continuation of broadcasts with informative and academic content..."
"We are going through an incredible process, but very few of us in T√ºrkiye are aware of it. It is necessary to learn a foreign language and leave Turkey, there is no other choice."
Where can we download it?
Now students can benefit from chatgpt 4.o very effectively and their questions will not remain unanswered.
How to use? Need an iPhone? I couldn't find an android application
"Brother, I refrain from downloading this app to my phone, I save all my passwords in some places on my phone, with some imperfections, so that I can remember them in my own way. The fact that such a smart app can access everything on my phone means that it can also decrypt these passwords over time. If this happens, it means it will happen to millions of people. There will be great destruction."
"I'm posting it, I'm tired of you saying the same thing in every video, okay bro, good luck with artificial intelligence."
"For God's sake, neither efficiency nor time... Right now, you are highlighting the speed of editing - checking etc. something that a person has written, but after a while, he will write his own program and there will be no need for a software developer."
"Mr. Cengiz, thanks to you, we can both follow these developments and come and see, there is nothing to fear, your approach is enlightening, comforting, thank you very much for your efforts."
"Nobody:

People of the future: Al-Fatiha to the souls of all accountants, programmers, translators, couriers, waiters, cashiers, messengers, meteorologists, singers and others..."
"The world is on the verge of a point of no return, and the fact that I had no involvement in this revolution and could only watch made me feel very helpless. If we do not want to be a suffering state and nation in the future, if we want to be free, I think we have to catch this technology train."
"I'm sorry, I'm ignorant on the subject. On which phones can we use this chat gpt and when will this feature come?"
"If only I had 20 dollars, I would be a Youtuber too"
"Teachers giving private lessons are done
Language courses went bankrupt"
"Why do you give such exaggerated titles to every new artificial intelligence video, babe science? Okay, it's exciting, but I'm getting bored of you giving such exaggerated titles to every video."
"For some reason people are still very optimistic about this situation. Friends, if robots really take over the world one day, which is very likely at this rate, humanity will completely disappear. Look, I'm not exaggerating, if robots and machines gain consciousness, the sure result will be absolute extinction. Movies like The Matrix don't show this because you need a main character, but real life isn't like that. In the food chain, the top always crushes the bottom. In the likely future, artificial intelligence will be tens of times stronger, faster, smarter, and more creative than us. Think about it, no matter how fast and smart you are, there is an entity that can process thousands of TB and more in seconds, learn and improve itself accordingly. This being will probably instantly calculate potential futures before you can take action, and will know where you are going before you even take a step. What can you do against this entity? Nothing. Little by little it will take away your work, and soon your ability to think. And before you know it, you'll be gone.

You may say I'm exaggerating, and I'd agree, but until recently I didn't even care about artificial intelligence. But this is not the industrial revolution. This is extinction."
"It is the same Artificial Intelligence software that the Super Surfer YouTube channel made by the man himself, months ago, but did not attract much attention when the Turks made it in Turkey: https://youtu.be/_eX6uLObGf4?feature=shared"

You should have put the camera up your nose bro.
"Frankly, I am not that enthusiastic about this development. Yes, it is a development that greatly increases the user experience, but we are not talking about the development of the model here, only a kind of promt engineering and software integrations are in question. For example, you can ask chatgpt to intonate the things it writes in a certain format and you can voice this through text to speech, you can detect it when it interrupts while talking with the software, you can convert the visuals from visual to text with OCR in the software and give it to the artificial intelligence and it can make a comment as if it sees it. All the developments made here are actually such plug-ins and software developments, that's why I think they left the name gpt-4."
"I loved the real-time translation feature. The world is truly becoming a global village. This is a great thing, as it will be possible to communicate regardless of language, religion or color. üòä"
Isn't it very good? Did I exaggerate too much?
It is both unsettling and exciting. But I'm not sure if we're saving time or suspending originality.
unbelievable
The future is scary
"I watched the movie ""HER"" twice... I was very impressed and dreamed to myself, ""How can I have a girlfriend like this before I die?""... üòÄ"
"I just mentioned this development to my wife, who is already working for the minimum wage and cannot find private lessons. Technological developments do not bring joy."
"They keep saying things but there is nothing. For example, where was Sora? Also, Gemini said similar things when it was first published."
Ucretli mi bu surum
"Don't get me wrong, Barƒ±≈ü √ñzcan also made the same analogy."
"If I asked the artificial intelligence directly about the movie ""Her"", I wonder what it would say ü§îüòπ"
I think we are facing a revolution
I think the reason it's free is because they want to collect data from us. I think they will release a paid version by adding more than 40 with the data they receive from us.
The world is falling apart and unfortunately we still continue to insist on searching for beads in Arab shit.
"It's always the same story :/ Then we open chatgpt, 2/5 . When we ask what 3.78 is, he even does that wrong... His grammar is also zero. Well, it's hard for those who don't pay."
From which platform can this chatgpt4o be downloaded? I always get fake programs. And it was called free
BUT IT HAS NO SOUL
I'm excited even though I know these things will take my job
"The world has gone completely out of control. Gpt is out, bravery is gone"
"haha ha ha .. we no longer need to appoint teachers. They couldn't answer your questions properly anyway. It is a great opportunity to close the budget deficit. In this way, I ask the state officials who can boost the economy, do not appoint teachers anymore, you will avoid both salary and pension payments. If every student starts with an iPad and chat gpt, let them take the exams on certain dates. We also evaluate schools for other work in some way."
OMG...

Remembering what we did to ourselves by postponing the printing press into our lives and the thought that the current development would cause problems for my freedom seemed to have started a war! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è whose side should I be on?
"I think we won't need to learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãanymore, but our brains will lose some functions, I don't know if it's a gain or a loss for us."
It is a wonderful event to live and experience the beginning of a new era.
"How quickly we forget the heroes of old times! There is khan academy in the video, we didn't notice it either"
"The ""hugging"" business can be dangerous. ü§∑"
"An incredible period has begun, I am very excited."
Can someone explain how I can use this feature?
"What if the correct answer is the kind we don't like, that is, it spoils our joy, for example, if our claim of purity of our hearts is undermined, then the user will be unhappy with the product, no manufacturer wants this, so the truth of this thing should be relative so that he is happy in our own lie! so we can continue to live. 82"

"Frankly, I would say don't be surprised by anything that may come up, it will evolve over time.
Just find a way that you can use beneficially for yourself."
Where is the assistant? How do we turn on the camera or voice call? I asked gpt and it says no
"We will no longer be able to tell who is human and who is a robot on the internet. The dead internet theorem seemed ridiculous to everyone at first, but now it is real."
"Many jobs in the private sector are currently under threat. Since I am currently working in the public sector, I feel comfortable with the article that acquired rights cannot be taken back no matter what. Even if the chat gpt is at 500, our job is guaranteed as long as there is no war until the age of 65."

Can you share the link where we can download it?
"Brother Cengiz, I think the age issue is more important for making retrospective comparisons."

"Bro, he says that with GPT 7, there will be no need for money, isn't it something like a joke?"
"Something that will be a solution to most things, depression, not being able to do something, everything is possible now."
"Sir, will there be a video about job opportunities for physicists and mathematicians in the new century age (how will they be affected)"
"In the promotional videos, I think those waiting times have been cut. For example, in the section where they said to translate, the editing was cut after each conversation and made more fluent. I'm not sure if it will be this fast when we use it. Of course, this is a comment independent of the fact that the development is great."
This is really useful for blind people.
"If one day my brother says, 'Come on, mind your business', we're screwed."
It seems like it will cause trouble for humanity.
"GPT 4 is good. That model has still not reached us. As someone who has been using GPT 4 Plus since its release, I would like to say this. Sometimes he really acts like a prankster. :) For example, I upload a PDF, I give a website link, I say educate yourself on this subject, but it doesn't actually educate you. However, if you ask him, he would examine it in depth:D There is a program called TouchDesigner and you run GLSL code in it. I told him to train himself on this subject, he said he was training me, he showed the progress bar, but he made the same mistake even though I told him the right thing forty times. It is a system that I will not be completely satisfied with unless there is personalization and personalized training. The memory feature has arrived, but it only takes notes of very simple things. In other words, education may be about ethics or something, but as long as others cannot access the education I provide myself, there is no problem. I hope they do this in GPT 5."
I think I found my new partner lsdlasdkja
DUDE THIS IS SO COOL
"Regarding health, I would like the artificial intelligence to tell me something like ""You ate food containing letics yesterday, your body needs to retain water, so eat less of that tulum cheese"" at breakfast etc. We are going to a very interesting place, but we are too old to see it."
What does abi bebar mean?
"Is it available? If it is not presented, can anyone write with information about when it will be presented?"
very expensive :')
"It really changes everything, it's an incredible thing, I'm in shock. Someone asked me 4-5 years ago, I said it would take 15 years to reach this level, I was very farsighted :D"
Don't look like Gemini
It's incredible by human standards that my personal assistant is a genius
"I can't wait to use it. For example, what can he do about instrument training? Can he teach piano to my 5-year-old daughter?"
"Black and white television, push-button phones, postcards, portable assistants, teachers, translators, etc. And this is just the beginning, traveling to Mars and other planets, going on vacation, etc.. If God gives us life, what else will we see in this short life of ours...)"
"I'm 15 years old, and for the first time, I got really excited about an advance in technology (or a revolution, whatever you call it). I don't know if I'm feeling fear or excitement, it's a very strange feeling inside me. If you see a child trying to use these developments in strange ways on social media to create content in the near future, it will probably be me."
They will name a new era in the future and the beginning of this era will be the first day chat gpt was released.
"Sir, I was deterred. I was not ready for the ""We showed our age by calling the handset"" part while I was in front of the full focus screen to hear your comment about GPT-4o. Thanks to you, my first conversation with GPT-4o was what to do in case of liquid contact üòÖ"
"If this thing reads YouTube comments and discovers itself thoroughly, then see what it can do."
"If it is free, this means more data entry, which will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence."
"Great technology, thanks for the video"
Can we install it on the phone and how?
It is clear who I will call using my phone joker in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire contest?

"Yes, it saves time, but in today's world of capital, time is money. That means there is no need for humans, or they will need as few humans as possible."
Everyone needs to be warned about where humanity is heading. Another issue is what are we doing in this field as a country? This is very important because this is a weapon and we are not armed yet. We need to take action to survive in the future
"Imagine that you are a software engineering student and just when you reached your senior year, artificial intelligence started to step on the gas in a way that could not be stopped. On the one hand, it was very exciting, but on the other hand, I can say that it turned my psychology upside down."
Then it won't bother you. What does he do when he gets angry?

YOU HATED HAZIRLA BEBAR
"I think in the future; We mortal humans will do things that robots do not want to do, things that are not necessary for them. Like agriculture, like art, for example. What does art mean for robots? Who has been able to fully understand the works of art that have been created so far? GPT is aware of them all, there is classical music. There is classical Turkish classical music, for example, who knows it with its modes and notes, is aware of harmony and harmony. Who knows how to read paintings and interpret sculptures? Poetry is a sign on the back of a truck for us. We will farm things that robots do not need. Wheat, potatoes, cucumbers and tomatoes do not need robots (even if they are under GPT management). We will do these, what is the need for animal husbandry and GPT? Give him to play the stock market, arrange plane landings and takeoffs and schedules. Let him see if a meteor will hit the Earth. From now on, it's up to us. Forget that, you can't unplug it either."
"As a society, I think our problem is that we have become complaint-oriented rather than solution-oriented, because it is easy to complain or criticize. I say this as a representation, when was the wheel invented and developed, the iron age, the bronze age, steam machines, etc., etc., we can increase it, the important thing is to improve the existing product or produce a new product, friends, if a person wants, we can do everything. He can do anything despite the obstacles. The important thing is to believe. How many attempts did Edison make to find and invent the light bulb? How many times would you give up or try harder?"
"Apple and Google had better not sit idle. Monopolization is one of the last things we want, especially in this period."
"Say goodbye to teachers, they can now easily browse Instagram and Facebook on their phones during class."
The teaching profession is about to disappear

When can we use the features of Gpt 4o in the video? Is there no answer
Take a look at what level they are at.
Will we be able to use this GPT-4 in Turkish or Azerbaijani?
"I wonder when they will make this available. Also, is it possible for artificial intelligence to see what they will offer in the new free version? In other words, it does not speak, but it sees and communicates with us by writing instead of speaking. Will they give this for free?"
"While wondering what else could happen, they are constantly doing better, we will see how far this will go."
I guess the Chief doesn't speak Turkish.

"A bit too perfect, PR stunt I guess. By the way, I would like to know that what I am talking to is AI. Speaking as if he were human poses a danger that could distort the perception of reality. This makes me feel that the worst case scenario of people who have been doing philosophy of science for years is approaching."
"Let's use it then, can you tell us where we can download it and how we can use it? Thank you."
"I think there is no such thing, the things in the video may be fiction. After 4 weeks or so, they will probably say they stopped the project and not release it, it may be a work done to further expand the brand name."

"Important... esteemed editor. I'm looking for an answer that I can't find anywhere!... I think if you post a video about this, it would attract a lot of attention worldwide. The question is this: Even though the launched mission satellites, such as Voyager 1-2, have been traveling for so many years, won't they hit an object on the way to an asteroid or something? For example, when passing the Kuiper belt... Is this space completely empty? Or what precautions are they taking? If you send a message saying ""Oh, turn right, there are stones on the road"", it will arrive in about 1 day. I am waiting for either a video or an answer. What I like most about your videos, which are watched by the relevant people, is that they are easily understandable by everyone. I appreciate you for this and wish you success. I'm glad to have you. ..."

"Friends, as someone who has been thinking about this issue since the day it first came to the fore many years ago, I would like to share the conclusions I have come to, which may alleviate or even further fuel the concerns we all rightfully share about the future. Just like the revolution that took place with the introduction of the computer into our lives, this will have the same effect exponentially. I am mentioning this because it is now a tool that will carry out transactions done in computer environment much more effectively. From now on, there will be no need for 8 out of 10 people to be employed in many different fields that you can think of, such as HR, finance and IT, because 2 people can do much more of the work of those 8 people with the AI ‚Äã‚Äãtools they have. can be carried out effectively. I am not saying that work will end completely in these sectors, but as you can understand from the reason I explained, employment will decrease very much. My advice to you is that young friends, especially those who are in the process of acquiring a profession, should turn to physical jobs, because white collar work will end in many areas. Basically, focus on areas that cannot be filled by software, a virtual assistant, or something that does not have a physical form. From security guard to carpenter. Otherwise, you will spend every second wondering when you will be unemployed. We are witnessing firsthand the emergence of a great revolution. The quicker you adapt, the more comfortable you will be in the future. This is the first law of evolution because those who adapt survive and continue their generation. Love to everyone."

"If the conversation involves video correspondence, artificial intelligence develops a self-learning path and the data entry network is processed quickly into the algorithm. Finally, artificial intelligence is in a teacher. By improving its own learning, the algorithm network increases, and thus, it speaks and teaches thousands of people at the same time. And against this it obtains an own research function."

"Although it is nice to see, hear and recognize everything, this so-called ""artificial intelligence"" is ultimately the product of a company where people work. It concerns me in terms of security and privacy that a company is so involved in our personal space, personal problems and conversations.

With the greed in us, we often tend to fill the saved time with more of anything. And unfortunately, these are often not things that serve our health, well-being and peace. It would be a real shame if we sacrificed so much progress to this basic urge of greed, our motivation should be to make the world a better place and move to a healthier paradigm. I'm curious about the different interpretations of what we can do on an individual and social level with the time we have saved. Thanks for your efforts!"
