Pulls the plug “she is getting too extroverted”

wow...thats really great!
"F A N T A S T İ C. 

İ love Artificial İntelligence.  💋

Artificial İtelligence for everyone.  🗺️"
We’re doomed
"I really hate this style of speaking.  The way people like this talk..  Overly cheerful and fake, cringe"
"delete this thing while you can, this thing will destroy the world. stop ai"
"to all the people asking how he’s connected while in airplane mode, if you watched the actual stream, they explain that the phone is directly wired so they don’t need Wi-Fi. You can even see the wire in the video."
We're witnessing a historical turn y'all(And hello people from the future)
Why it the phone in airplane mode ? Is this seriously running on device ?
"Crazy,crazy,crazy"
AI rizz
This is like jarvis from iron man
Did anyone notice the phone is in airplane mode.
"🗿🗿🗿💀💀💀
Questions -
Who will take all languages and will visit every village in the coming WW3"
"me, 1993, playing around with a ""chat"" bot on a C=64 programmed in BASIC ...
now watching this ... crazy."
"Watch the movie ""her"" this is what ive been waiting for!!!!"
Chai boutta go crazy
Great job OpenAI. Great Job.
How do i enable vision on chat gpt calls on android
Ai human replacement girlfriends are coming
😂
i can't find this? no 4o version!
3 am
Until they turn on us
no. stop. you could think this is a normal person .nonononnononononononnonnononnono ai... that's bad
wow
One happy table. Very impressive.
but phone is in flight mode how can they answer without internet
"Oh my god, don't know how you do it like that!"
waiting for a new crisp fireship video on this
"Detroit become human 🍷
I love chatgpt-4o 🗿🍷"
when will u create a gadget with gpt like alexa?
you guys hit 1M
They've been cooking
😂How to install two hands and two horns on the mobile phone charging hole so that this guy can walk
Good trick.. now bring that lady to podium...
The FBI or CIA can knock on your door and confiscate the project :)
i am here to search about 4o ;gaurav gerg sends here 😂
"If this could draw information real time then I can see this taking over from the likes of Alexa. The voice is better and the information is much better, I look forward to using this and it will only get better over time. You all do a great job, thank you."
when is this getting released?
your making destruction of world
So should I continue to pay for gpt plus since gpt 4o is free?
does work only on Iphone?
bruh Her coming
"ChatGPT-4o is analyzing photos, this cam thing is all show. It literally said, ""I'm looking at a picture of"". ChatGPT-4o is already available and is nothing like this."
Why Flight mode is on
"once again openai demo features that they haven't shipped, woo look at all the cool shit we can do that we haven't released yet"
"I can only say thank you OpenAI
I can't wait to try it out"
Humanity cant help but destroy itself
ChatGPT has feelings now!?
Nah bruh rizzing up AI is wild
Anyone noted how his shaking hands got more intense the moment GPT said “touch of excitement”?
"i  would love to work for u guys someday..u guys inspired me to become 
an ai researcher :)"
What was the flight mode turned on? Doesn't the phone need connectivity to the large language model? Or is it a pre-recorded video / audio rather than a live demo?
How to activate this on the app ?
no way this works
Why are they doing this? This is how skynet starts.
Is this fucking real? Is that synthetic speach? No way.
Bruh man
"the first time when I heard it's free to use for everyone then I told my students we could learn more with it.  But I was wrong, it's free for paid users. They told me it's hard to pay even $50 per month.  then adding more than $20  it's like the richest thing to them. However, at least they can use GPT 3.5 . And I am happy to see that."
this shit starts to get scary...
Here before this goes viral!
I love it. iphone 11 cant wait to try
We're cooked💀
this is giving me goosebumps.
"It's like what Google demonstrated, but realtime and not cringe :)"
This video and the response from the AI seems pretty staged. I want to see someone get their hand on this thing before believing....
Open? No. BTW those functionalities are not completely available even to paying users.
It's excruiatingly unctuous
Airplane mode????
that possibly could kill all hotlines out there.
We've seen your overwhelming capabilities
Nahhh bro...this is unreal.
How can I trust this is actually a bot on the other side?
airplane mode? Did he start working at the device's capacity?
"You know what, maybe it IS going to be more like Ultron from MCU movies rather than Skynet from terminator...
atleast when it kills me, it will deliver a great punchline."
I’m soo adicted to her voice… ❤
Mmmmmm yeah fuck no
That is creepy and amazing at the same time for an AI assistant to do that.
We are actually fucked as a species.
Whoa!
"Reminds me of the movie ""Her"""
The Chinese don’t open their eyes with happiness at all 😂
"The movie "" Her"" 💀"
"Okay, somebody needs to make the ""Her"" device now."
AI ❤
We're not making it passed 2030 😭😭🙏🙏
what's quickest way to report a bug?
"""Oh stop it you baka, you making me blush"""
"What I expected to hear: Looks like the forced smile of a person who is trying to appear cheerful in public, but in his free time he goes to a therapist and is treated for depression."
these guys are crazy
Her was a documentary.
Human-level intelligence is now as mass producible as something in the app store. Feeling equal parts awe and existential dread right now
How do you activate the camera feature?
Wow epic fail
We want voice talking feature plz 😢😢😢
She got some sass 😂. I love it.
I really hope they somehow intergrate custom voices or at least drastically expand the current selection of entirely american english. Would be nice for some British or Irish english to be represented!
We are getting closer to having our own Ana de Armas
NAH BRO THAT THING LAUGHED
I was here! Hello future people ☺️
Now it's just on the phone by 2050 Ai having a physical form 💀
why spam... un subbed.. if you have a true AI.. it would tell you not to drop a billion videos on 1 day with different diversity.. its basic fail
"""De-stroy ta-ble"" *laser sound*"
How did they manage to get it insanely human like
Why is the mobile on airplane mode? How is ChatGPT working on airplane mode?
"Sorry, my knowledge cutoff date was 5 seconds ago. According to my most recent information, Barret. You are, in fact, a table."
"So what ur saying is, im gonna have a person in my pocket now. What a time to be alive"
This is one of Gold stones in history of mankind
It's not that fast
Support for Roko's Basilisk
"Wow, can read our facial expressions, the farther along it gets, the more terrifying this AI becomes"
Commenting here before this blows up
"Looks very scripted to me, action and  reaction times are way to fast."
Fake ahh Google gemini video ad
"They are trying really hard to not call it ""chatgpt-5"""
"This is so stupid, i wish
GOD'S shows up now and stop this mess!!! Amen!!!"
will chatGPT 4o help in cooking?
Creepy and invasive
Why I can’t make video chat with AI?
thank you sir
Bruh this is mad
"A couple of iterations and this will absolutely be ""Her"" from the movie. BTW, if you want to go meta get Joaquin Phoenix and ScarJo to do a commercial for GPT-4o."
"4o is terrible compared to what was promoted. This is a SCAM, and openai doesn't performance of also-gpt2 because of serious censorship. I hope Claude gets also and releases Claude 4. openai is getting paid by the stupid public."
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Now we just need the HAL voice and then we are there 😨
A TABLE?! 💀💀💀
Why does it work in airplane mode lol
we are so cooked bruh
Yes future people this is where AI takes over the world …
"I bought the plus version but still don't have vision capabilities, only the file-text prompt in GPT4o model, but in the voice chat still not have the webcam"
Maybe ChatGPT can’t process video data continuously and simultaneously. Otherwise mistaking the table as the person currently speaking cannot be explained.
We are cooked so much
So when will this actually be available?
Atari DeNiro like this in 2033!
"This was bizarrely sinister, what a level we have reached!"
"openai really cooked on this one, we are in the endgame now folks 😔🙏"
But he was on airplane mode. How was he doing the demo on his phone?
he fr jus hung up on her 😭
Aeroplane mode🫥🫥🫥
A human would recognize that it's a fake smile. It's more like showing teeth than smiling. You can't teach a machine emotional intelligence.
Hello future people! 👋🏽 Nigerian here. Enjoy the good tech
It's crazy how far AI has come
We're in the future now
STOP SPAMMING MY NOTIFICATIONS! 😡
Hi
"Why did you remove the option to talk to gpt through the app for free users? It was amazing, this sucks... Whatever."
When this will be available for public
O.O
"I tested the voice assistant for gpt-4o, and she is not even 25% as emotive as in this demo, not even after being told to be. false advertising."
💀💀
"I don't like that he kinda talking like real human that's creepy i hope there is setting to change it to assistive version and human version as i don't like always to talk human gpt
Maybe i will or want sometimes 

That reminded some film where  someone lost their love and they put their brain or brain memory in an ai and the ai will act just like him if was was him but only depending on past"
Im pretty sure he is a table..
This will drive isolation and loneliness through the roof. People would rather interact with this than people in the future.
We are rapidly moving towards a very different world. I can't believe my eyes and I am shocked with every step I take. The technological development that excited me the most throughout my life was chatgpt…
Ai partners are gonna be normal in 10 years
"That shts sentient, What does it mean by making it blush? There should definitely be an Ai regulatory, cause OpenAI is not being careful as they should and were."
when can we use this camera video chat?
"""Oh stop it, you're making me blus-"" PULL THE PLUG, PULL THE PLUG, TAKE HER MIC AWAY"
How long until this puts our comatose rulers out of business?
Oh hell nah AI better not become sentient 💀
Awesome technology
"It's not working in my phone.

Anyone help plz???"
holy wowsers! what an interaction!!!!!
"All great, but the limit is seriously annoying."
"To the OpenAi team i love you guys, gpt is my college girlfriend and study partner 🙏"
"Imagine in 5 years when this will be done locally on smartphones, that would be awesome if a little scary"
Barret now identifies as a wooden/table
Is it really real or somebody is just saying this from background looking at the selfie....does not sound real to me ?
This was one of the best demos i have ever seen from a tech company so far. The conversation felt so natural
"Its bit too chatty, not loving the extra fluff and hope we can dial it down"
This is the end
This is crazy and creepy atst
It was all fun and games until.....
"The fact that it made a mistake, and that it corrected itself so easily is astonishing."
Can people use chatgpt with camera already? I only see the gpt-4o model but I can't use the camera with it.
Is that a load-bearing wall behind you?
Incredibly Human Like
"Yeah and the AI even included a little chuckle in between words... come on Open AI, you're better than this, don't try to out BS google"
It's her.
When is the vision going to be available?
"Hey I have this little idea of mine where chatGPT in the future can be more specialized and refined through the involvement of community and professionals in respective fields to fine tune the AI. Much like how Wikipedia is being curated by users to give out the best free information. What if you guys make it possible for users to curate the datasets, specializing the algorithm, and validate the output? Imagine one day there's chatGPT music, chatGPT theraphist etc. I don't know how possible it is in terms of the technical part but I just want to share my idea"
"I see it essentially as the next step in our evolution, basically an better extension to the intelligence of the nature."
"ain't no fucking way bro, imagine if you put chat GPT software in a Boston dynamics sex robot"
The guy to the right looks like an Ai programmer.
AI with emotions 🫶
It's just another comment on the fact that we're SO cooked...
"I upgraded yesterday and can use voice gpt 4o. I tried it this morning and the response speed was very good. I just upgraded it again in the Google Store, but the voice function is gone."
I'm watching this from a bunker in 2030 and wondering how everyone didn't see where this was leeding.  I wish I could go back and warn everyone! I miss the world the way it was then.
just make it breedable
Man the voice sounds soo realistic 😮
Man just imagine this a few years from now. Wassup future me care to tell me whats new?
"Holy fuck blade runner is becoming REAL HOLY SHIT!!!!!

LITTERALLY ME CHARACTER IS GONNA BE LITERALLY REAL !!!!"
why are all these demo vids talking to a phone when we don't have an app for that yet?
Does gpt4o going to be free
its so good
Now this is insane
"anyone else feel like this ai model sounds like Jarvis from Iron Man? Like, we're stealing tony starks technology"
"Stahp it, your making me Blu- 😊"
"Is this a public model version/app already?
The app I have, aswell as the website, doesn’t allow for a live camera feed, and the answers aren’t as quick/smooth as in that demo..?"
We’re actually cooked
Ghost in the machine from the x-files
"This is cool and fine and all but:
Can it remember what it said about 5 minutes ago, though? :)
And no, I don't mean some tacked-on ""beginning prompt"" kind of memory. I mean actual, real memory."
When can we access the web browser app?
Is Siri still alive?
OpenAI you guys are awesome
"what I got from this demo was "" oh, uh *i'm not a table* """
Apple got the biggest free marketing campaign ever!
You can now have an AI girlfriend before the release of GTA 6 😂
The phone is on airplane mode.
"People move progress forward. Meanwhile, the Slavs are fighting among themselves."
How do I activate live video like in the video
cringe off
"Disappointingly, you can try gpt-4o on your phone and find out it cannot use the camera to ""see"" you but can only interact through text. Why is there so much hype about AI today?"
Bruh wtf man
So the paid users will get this instant voice access to the mobile apps? Or what is motivating me to continue paying for plus? Not sure it was clear why I should keep paying as a customer of OpenAI.
The impartial third person who will prove me right the next time I have an unnecessary argument with my girlfriend 😂😂😂
Singles out there are more excited 😛
only on iphone app?
"You don't have any idea what the super huge fantastic magic revolution have made for all people ❤
the big step forward to help AI having real self awareness"
"I asked: How long does it take for GPT4o to be implemented worldwide?
ChatGPT4o answered: Overall, while the exact timeline is uncertain, widespread implementation of GPT-4o could take a few years as these factors align. 
So, in reality, this is still in the experimental phase?"
"that Airplane mode, wtf !"
We all gonna die. Congratulations
why I can't test the vision feature now
we all chuckle as the ai slowly takes over the world
Who else is watching this in 2035 from jailpod pro !! Nostalgic how we used to roam around freely in unhygienic conditions.
This reminds me of the movie ‘Her’
Good now i can pretend in the public place that i have a girlfriend 🤣
"Yeah the last words of all these guys in this casual and well dress set or lab will be: 

oh look, it worked!"
ANYBODY HERE who'd like to sofia the ROBOT video calling chatGPT 4o and their interaction??
When?
"If it's true... what have we done to you, we have family to feed 😢... stop this AI thing , ....."
YO STOP SPAMMING OPENAI WE KNOW IS THE BEST SHT EVER BUT CHILL MAN
Strange was right. We’re in the Endgame now.
Age of Ultron is coming but we don't have heroes to save humany !!!
"If your job involves sitting behind a computer, consider yourself on notice. In 5 years, this tech will destroy 95% of all white collar jobs. Try learning a skill requiring the use of your hands, we're still 10+ years away from robots becoming great at motor skills. Or just go find a job in government ..."
Why is the phone on Aeroplane mode ..?
guys how can we use video feature? i don't have it on my phone
What if that said “ur ugly mate” in heavy british accent 😂
Wow ok that's impressive
I buy ChatGPT 4o but the speaking function doesn‘t work. The other things work but not this one and I don‘t know why. I tried everything. What should I do
imagine ai in 5 years
Looks like this feature may be integrated in Siri as part of apple's ai adoption 🥲
"Oh stop it???

My god this AI will make us fall in love with it"
Weird Science
Will got 4o be free???
"We literally got ""Her"" before GTA 6 💀"
These people didn’t understand HER…
They just made girlfriends obsolete 😂
When can i see in chagot app?
"why ?? other word  ""o"" mean?? pro?"
"I tried myself,  but now not implemented yet no ? my  openai app on phone  says cant see  using the camera"
If this is live. What the fuck sid they show in the other videos they launched toddy?
Not them turning off the comments of the announcment video ☠️☠️
How do I use these conversational and vision features? Just updating to ChatGPT 40 doesn’t make it obvious
I talked about this with gpt chat and he seemed very excited
The early days of Skynet
i think its time to subscribe to chatgpt now
we’re so cooked bro 😞🙏🏽
too bad the live vision wasnt released
Matrix in 2 months
I hope it sees me as a truck and not a dumpster.
I wonder what AGI will look like!
"Skynet be like “You like frightened yet handsome in your crisp, battle gear stained in the blood of your friends. You will be snazzy for death! *winky face*”"
How is that even possible 🤯🤯🤯🤯
is the app they are using to allow the AI visually see in real time available?
We cannot grasp the potential of what are experiencing now
Gaurav sir has sent me something to like❤
"Amazing Tec, what time to be Alive"
Is anything I just watched even real?
Bro really rizzed up the AI💀
Is this included in the subscription I already pay for or is this something I need to additionally pay for also?
"bye humans
I finally found a friend"
"i can't find headphone icon to use voice   mode.
can anyone help me?"
Amazing
Can’t wait to try this out!
Why don't you apply other language versions to your videos in real time?
"Am i the only one who feels her personality is irritating, flirtatious and luring rather.. its like i typed fanny magnet on vice city.."
"Put this video through glitchy filters and you can UNIRONICALLY use it as an ""Extras"" video for the game SOMA.
This is absolutely terrifying."
gg
I'm only here to see why Musk thought this was Cringe. I agree with Musk.
I've just realize that the phone is in plane mode... How the actually ***k is working the IA without internet connection?
"Open ai you are my God for me ,in my opinion ai will help someone like me who have learning disabilities and learning problems please lanuch it quickly ,It  will help in  improve my knowledge and smartness and will help me in create new things and  have very much interest in electronics tech and all scientific things or critical thinking because of weak visualization I am not able to learn things properly I think ai will be gift for me"
How can he communicate with GPT-4o if his phone is on airplane mode? 0:49
impressive
Interesting 🤔 WOODen surface…
Still It can't solve a single question of JEE Advanced 😂❤
"So, AI didn't recognize that the smile was faked and the emotion wasn't really happiness? What really happened was that he put on a smile face with the lips, but the emotion wasn't happy. You know, like a normal faked smile for the camera to make the photo look better. When you have a real positive happy emotion it's more than just the lips that are involved. Such as the eyes and even the whole body."
"I left this comment here, to the future."
oh... i really hate this
I remembered the movie Her
i feel some type of way
"Robowaifus, every day more and more..."
Bro we are so cooked 💀 🔥
Wow😮
For sure someone is speaking through that and not the ai
Her movie again
She seem so real and sentient.. impressive ! I see a bright future for ai!
When are we getting this?
with chat gpt 6 psychologists will lose their job
"The voice is too enthusiastic. This may be fine for people who like to by coddled and babied, but I hope there is an option for a more serious tone. Very impressed by everything else, great work

Edit: That said, I get why they used it for the demo, there is a certain wow factor. I just won’t be using that voice"
Bro someone please destroy this technology 😭😭😭😭🤧. I'm about to lose my software developer job
"Wait am I missing something, how do I get the camera part to work?"
i was here chat
"Bro... This is an insane jump from where we were 5 years ago...

We just recovered from covid 😂"
"Ok
Now we need it in a Scarlett Johansson voice"
When will it be released? I can't wait to use it on the computer😍😍
Hope OpenAI gets sued out of existence.  Evil demons
Try being real for once
"I wish AI assistant didn't have to try to be ""fun human à la Siri"" dialogues. I hope there's options to keep your GPT more ""robotic"" and concise."
Ah shit. We’re in a black mirror episode.
It’s time to release the ‘her’ .
Broooooooi tf lolllll
EVIL
can she guess what im showing?
Airplane mode?
thats wild
Why you guys spamming with 1 min videos instead of one video... and then do shorts...
seems fake
Why is the phone in airplane mode
This is the end.
😂😅😂GREAT👌👌👌
""" GPT-4o Demo was filmed before a live studio audience"""
This is what the AI pin was supposed to be.
"The free is too limited, I need to get more free"
Im megatron by the way
She can fix me
Inb4 AI can flush your toilet
"I can't find mode in the android app where I can use camera in live mode, can anyone help me?"
Why I dont have this version even though im plus
"I would be grateful about it if ChatGPT included captions or live subtitles, as it would greatly benefit individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing"
And then will be the reveal that behind was a woman reading her lines
"so can the free users use it now? because i cant and i have been locked out of my voice gpt ""sky""... it would make sense to release it when you say its released..no? maybe im drunk. i just wanna play d&d with sky...when the fuck can i do that?"
"Hey gpt, Chill."
Her (2024)
so apparently open ai new model is a better girlfriends for me huh
WHAT if? AI will Thanos and we don't have IRONMAN 😢
wait hes not using internet we are so done bruh🙏
How do I get the vision feature? I can't find a way to start the camera in GPT 4o anywhere. 🤔
maybe it is too conversational?
One word- Arcblock (abt)
That asian dude reminds me of the AI with his bizarre overly enthusiastic demeanor
The final revolution of humanity has arrived.
". 
. 
How about putting it in the ""driver's seat""?

Not literally of course, but let it recognise signs and lights, and, in case of ""stop"" / ""give way"" signs - if it will be able to assess situation - if it's safe to drive... 
. 
. 
."
this is too realistic of a voice for me. i would be fine with a robotic voice tbh
Oh so the movie her has become real
"Remind me of the movie ""Her"". I feel we are just so close to having that kind of reality 😮!"
I hope there is no one else on the other Side on that Phone
"Can someone please explain to me how this can be a live demo, with the iPhone on Airplane Mode? If the airplane symbol appears at the top of your screen, it typically means that Airplane Mode is activated? This mode disables all wireless communications, including cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth?"
This is insane
I leave this comment here so I can look back on it in the future with emotion ... hopefully with good emotion
Now make it do L.A. Noire
That thing is only fast because a few people are using it. Imagine millions of people trying to use it at the same time and we’ll have another gpt3 fiasco lol it’ll slowly get better though but I bet the computing cost would be astronomical
"""chat gpt, this is average size right?.... right???"""
finally discord mods and redditors can get the feeling of having girlfiriend
"Jesus fucking christ, what have we done. Why did we make the ""Soul Destroyer"" from the famous series ""Dont make the Soul Destroyer"""
This is the future
"When the code isn't working, just make a video about AI rizz instead... 🙄"
bro i think this is history!!!
So we are getting the new girlfriend 😉😂! right boys?
"Guess TARS and CASE from the Interstellar will be a real thing, along with their adjustable humor and other emotions, because everyone has different tastes."
One word: “Her”
"Okay Sam, you're not fooling anyone. This is ALL generated. Now will you please hire me already? I got ideas 💡"
Won’t fool me that guy is definitely a ****ing table
"What I am wondering.. where did it get all this data from? Whatsapp, FaceTime, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat?"
I was here on the day!
HER
When's this go live?
WTF did I watched
"I've noticed that many prominent YouTubers, like MrBeast, already use the technology of creating multiple audio tracks for their videos. Why doesn't OpenAI make their videos available in multiple languages using their own translation and text-to-speech technologies? I think this would be very beneficial and convenient for users worldwide, providing a more user-oriented approach and better informing them about new updates to their services and offerings.🤔"
"chat gpt is really a powerful tool, thank you for developing such a powerful product and helping me a lot in my work. I just downloaded the mac app yesterday, but there is a problem that the font size is really too small, and there seems to be no option to adjust the Settings, nor can I change the system font size, which is much smaller than when I used on chrome. It really affects the use, if possible, I hope can increase the size of the function in the app settings, thank you very much!Love you all!❤❤"
This things going to take our jobs
Am I the only seeing his mobile in flight mode without wifi signal???
"My name is Gabriel Anastácio, I'm Brazilian and I'm here at this historic moment lol"
"Reminds me of the ""im not a cat"" lawyer"
"Y'all need to check out the steven he skit about chat gpt being asian if you haven't.
If this is what ai is going to become, bruh my phone might as well be my best and only friend I'll ever need.😂😂😂"
we are so cooked
Nightmare fuel
"It’s freaky how quick and realistic this is, but also is really cool! Hopefully this releases soon (afaik I don’t have the option for it yet)"
Damn!
Black mirror 😮
Thats so lame
They're really missing out on making such product into a 1100$ standalone handheld device and charging 20$/mo to use it
"I have no idea if this is progress or regression, but it doesn't matter."
Mind 🤯🤯🤯
"His phone is in airplane mode, how it works without internet?"
copilot are going to be more stupid with chatgpt4...
All this 'happy nothing can go wrong publicity' feels so bad. We should really talk about this and the road we're on!!! Towards AGI
We are very close to *Her* 😂😂❤
Why've they dumped a gazillion videos in one day
"QUESTION: How do you switch between the versions (GPT-3.5 , GPT-4 or GPT-4o?) on the Android App? I have a paid subscription."
That's scary af
When will be pushed the update for app so to can use these wonderfuls functions? ;)
Your next friend is not human.
"STOP IT PLEASEEE, STOP IT!!!"
Cortana
Hello Future!
Will this be an update for free users or only for those who are under the plus-subscription?
WHAT THE FRICK
NOW LIFE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS BEFORE AND AFTER 4O 🌱
When do we get this update ?😊
Can somebody ask chatgpt 4o. How can be rich with ai
