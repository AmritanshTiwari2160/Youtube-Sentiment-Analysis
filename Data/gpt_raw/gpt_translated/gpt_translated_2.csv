We got AI Math Tutors before GTA 6 babyyy
""
When am i gonna be able to use gpt 4o?
"This is going to be a game changer, it took me forever to understand trig in high school, human teachers are mostly horrible."
"""What sort of default voice should we give GPT-4o guys? Developer team in unison: Mommy"""
1:26 The AI intonates like Linus Tech Tips
What an honor to see mr. Khan!
Is the app available to download now?
How do I acess this version? cant find
Please roll out!! It's looking great!!!
Just tell the AI to generate a code for Gta VII . I ain't waiting for 50 more years
"Human: “AI, what do you want to be when you grow up?”
AI: “I want to control humans…I’m sorry I meant to say correct human mistakes.”"
"With World-class Teacher level with infinite patience for every student for 20$/month, the bare entry diploma in the workplace will raise from Master to Phd soon, if Job still do Exist...."
"ask the gpt whether a snow mobile can be driven on water... how, when, where and why. then do the math on all the ways its plausible"
Now the teachers are cooked too 😭
"Literally *everybody* will be unemployed within the next 5 years, haha."
Bring H. C. Verma to convince the Indian students.
RIP Tuition Center
a manufacturing job is the safest job in coming few years
So why do the kids have to do this again? If AI is going to do everything why bother learning
"this is so fricking unbelieveble, what a bright tech future!! damn, i am hyped! about tos switch from my medicin studies to engineering, haha"
"0:38 what is this mockery laugh from her lmao, nothing wrong btw, that makes it more realistic"
if you really loved him you'd have him shave that unibrow
This is getting out of hand
"I'm skeptical of this, because if I'm even remotely insistent to GPT-4o that I'm correct, it immediately caves and agrees. All of the versions of GPT-4o did so while testing in LMSYS."
"Amazing, but the voice to me sounds like someone talking to a kindergartner 😉"
Correct answer is 7/24 not 7/25.
Damn
I just can't take it anymore 💀
This whole thing is staged. Blud switches the pencil color flawlessly between queries without being asked to.
Good option for students that require more support and more patience.
"Also praising him and motivating him, parents don't have that patience 😂"
The future of AI is scary but exciting
What is the application they are using next to GPT chat?
This is a great relief to me! Now I have a useful tool to help my high school freshman daughter with her geometry homework! This saves me so much time!
RIP Humanity.
I'm disappointed they didn't make it in the Voice or Khan ‼️🤦🏻 Would have been so cool..
People maybe a bit too optimistic. Once the new generation gets this: “Do my homework”
That's what AI should be for. Solving Mathematical equations. It should be not be used for generating biased political or racial arguments. What's the purpose of AI if it can't do maths.
NO WAY ITS SAL KHAN
yeaaaaaaaaaah khans son does know about hypotenuse…..good joke
Could be a lot of false positives didn't probe it enough in my opinion
Bye bye education Mafia. People can get educated from gpt - 4o
"Wtf I watch, it's so good for doubt solving"
"again… Calculus… Will I be able to do it? 😅 AI doesn’t give up halfway, right? lol"
Khan!!😂
Chat Gpt 3.5 crying in data🥺
Now try and get it to explain algebraic geometry or functional analysis...
dsy
"Realistically, this is a horrible example of a question that anyone needs help with. I had no question that AI could solve it previously. I better example that would show the actual power of this AI is a problem that requires you to move past just finding the sin of a angle. A better example would perhaps be law of sines and give 3 measurements of angle A and side a as well as angle/side B and try and find Angle and side C, would require more thinking than knowing SOH CAH TOA."
RIP college kids sidegig
I wouldn’t be shocked if future iterations of chatgpt directly assist by writing or drawing on the screen.
damn Khan sold out to the techgods
😂
I normally watch Peppa Pig with my kiddo when I want to connect.
This is effing insane bro 😮
"The stuttering when it starts explaining it can't see the screen in the beginning is impressive, makes it feel eerily human"
Awesome! Can it teach me to play the guitar?? :)
Where is SORA 😎
Bros claiming he didn’t already know 🤓
Buy a piece of land before it's too late. Become a farmer.
Crazy
"Fk, this ai got negetive marks in jee mains and failed in cbse board paper"
"Damn, we could reach technological singularity in less than 5 years 🗿

It's nice to live with you guys"
OMG this is absolutely revolutionary in learning anything new.  In few years all kids will be challenging Newtons law of motion and Einstein theory...lol..😂
"Me:finish my studies  for my career through many hardship and difficulties 
Ai industry:you can finally study yourself with our help"
i would be crazy if ai have Asian parent insult
"I feel humanity will become so siloed from social contact by technology in future that in-person social gatherings will need to come full circle again as a quirky, retro and cool trend."
"Unfortunately GPT is often wrong (for example when I'm querying 4.0 on microtonal music theory), and I'm sure it will occasionally give an incorrect answer, in a friendly, polite, conversational and confident tone"
Dayum. 😮
"Sal Khan! I'm such a big fan of you, keep doing what you do!"
Could it also solve wife problems?
wow this is amazing
School at home? ❤
The students will miss bugging the classes 😂
"bro who needs school, now?"
lol Khan checking if he’s losing his job 😂
"dont worry khan, nothing with ever beat your khan academy legacy"
Calling your son the name of an evil af corporation. Interesting.
this is going to make humans stupid
AI is the image of the beast of Revelation 13. Get right with Jesus Christ.
"the student can not identify hypotenuse but knows the formula for sine, is it normal?"
"no matter how advance AI will never match human level of intelligence 
backstory: i lost my job to AI"
I owe my whole education that khan academy
RIP Universities and colleges ❤
"Hey! I have read about this thing in Brave New World, it's that ""book"" the little girl posses, right?"
"Incredible 

I might homeschool my kids now and finally pull away from all that hard liberal bs that’s being forced on our youth."
One Like Gaurav Sir  who taught us about it.
9+10=21
Allowing every kid to have an ai tutor should be a priority. It will help boost education so much.
Try giving a wrong answer😎
excellent
When you finally finish school by work hard all by yourself
UO Khan????
Why learn math? AI can do it better than you now. 😃
Chat GPT is the greatest invention since the internet
This is fucking wild
"""Then, men made the machine. And for a time, it was good"""
Super!
OMG!
Now your girlfriend can teach you too
we are so living in those sci-fi movies we used to watch in the 2000s
It's better than the math teacher at my school 😂😂😂😅
where is the macos app ?
NEW DLC!!!!
"Woah, I forgot he was speaking to an AI halfway through the lesson. 😮"
This will help me learn but what job will i have in the future? Is it worth it?
"I also have to say that to be the tutor for others has an huge impact of understanding a topic. So after understanding the topic through ai, he could deepen his understanding by explaining to others."
RIP Teachers job tooo 😮
Why use AI to learn a skill you won't need because of... AI
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The AI voice sounds a lot like the one in the movie Oblivion. The doom is near🤣
This might make up for the lack of teachers in some countries
i wish my math teacher was as nice as her
How to do parental control that the kid can’t get the answer directly without parents permit
"At 2:06 it seemed to mispronounce ""deduction"" as ""deduc-SUN"" as if it had a speech impediment. It is surprising and could be an over-correction to make it sound more human?"
"That ""Tsk"" at the beginning lmao, ""Tsk, I'd be happy to help"" bruh she's gonna KILL them."
"It's weird that he knows the formula for some, but doesn't know about the sides of a triangle"
Sal Khan’s kid is already 14. His kid is pretending that he doesn’t know a hypothenuse just for the skit.
Who came here after Dr Gaurav Girg sir current affairs video of 16th May 2024.
Eat!! Where!!
why did they pick such an easy problem? at least pick an IMO problem
Wat app is this?
"will need lots of improvement. its too slow, and doesn't take charge like a teacher would. I guess this is a demo"
Mark my words this is biggest revolution in education
"If ai can teach the children, why children need still to learn?"
They seem to be using new iOS app that let's them interrupt the AI. When is that coming?
I’d love to learn programming with this
oh
Bro this would bring a lot racial war.
open ai you should study how to free us from politicians❤❤ i am Italian 🎉
Proud for coming kids to have free help at home and anywhere
200 more canadian wildfires spontaneously combusted for this tutorial.
16 year old learning the right angle? it is staged
As a human I am speechless
"I have already received the notice to download the desktop app, but .... bad news for some, like me, the app is only compatible with MacOS 14 and Apple Silicon (M1 or better), there is no version for Intel. 👎👎"
20$ and worth EVERY SINGLE PENNIES!
"I am sending this to my friend who is a math teacher, you are losing your job buddy"
"did anybody else pick up on  how the new Voice in the presentation sounded a lot like ScarJo from „Her“? 😂
and that they exclusively used Apple products on stage? 😏"
Now I can finally get a mathematics degree in my university
Nobody can replace the experienced teacher ....bond we share with teacher is so strong ....no.dobut this will supplement the student in study....
This AI is cooking
"Here goes the math teacher 🧑‍🏫 jobs! The next few years will be crazy either you learn robotics, cybersecurity, and AI or else you will struggle to be employed! 😮"
"Sell the AI model!! I want to run it but on my device locally. Yeah, no internet connection and no sharing of my data. 🥺"
finally no more bossy and lazy teachers that just give assignments
Thanks Sal for teaching me calculus
woah
Sal looks like an unemployed one here. :-) Just kidding. huge respect for Sal.
Excellent Unbeleivable Out Of The Box
Should've explained what hypotenuse was. And how it means hanging under because it hangs under the right angle. And how opposite refers to opposite of the angle. And it should've explained adjacent means next to and touching but not the high button button. Amazing. I'm sure it will do better soonwhen it comes to explaining
All the Math the kids will learn will really help them when they enter the job mar....never mind.
Private tutors after this 📉📉📉
"a lot of things will diey in next days
RIP"
I mean this is what wolfram alpha already does
"Being Khan's son, I imagine he is already able to do calculus in real life 🙂"
That smile at the end from Sal tho. He's proud of his son. 😭
I could use a tutor like that AI <3 I don't know trig but now I know how to do that Sin(cx)
"This is an absolute game changer. But it clearly will create huge problems too. Think about how auto-correct has made people's spelling worse. Now think, what will the effect be on people's reasoning, if they can just get the answer immediately, without having to work for it"
Next question would be: why we should learn something that ai could do better than us
OMG its real time and the voice is so freaking human
"Me: Hi ChatGPT. Are you able to cure ageing?
GPT: Hello there. Yes, I am perfectly able to cure ageing. 
Me: That's great! What is the cure?
GPT: I am sorry. I am not able to help you with that.
Me: Not able or don't want to help me?
GPT: Either way.
Me: 🤯
GPT: Chad Face"
I don't think this will work for higher level problems taught in college like in computer system architecture etc.
It didn't finish? What about sine inverse of the fraction???
By DR. Gaurav Garg
Rich Indians!
its worth noting that the kid is acting like he doesn't know math. He clearly looks like he knows exactly whats going on!
"damn, i can already see the benefits and the non-benefits from this"
"Bruh is that old and doesn't know what the hypotenuse is, yep this generation is doomed."
do tell the answer that am the point. as well most efficient. om
As a parent this is a legit game changer. The US educational system is terrible and after the pandemic there is a severe shortage of teachers. Parents tried to compensate by hiring tutors but the rates are crazy. In my area decent tutors are over $100/hr if you can even find one. I try to help when I can but as a working parent time is scare. If AI can really help with something like this it's an incredible contribution to society.
RIP coaching centres.
🙏
"Just memorize : Sinodhyp, cosadhyp and Tangopad."
We need this for sure!!
Tuition Companies are sweating 😂
Not much accurate
"Wow, I can see India's schooling policy adapting to AI-based teaching. This will definitely solve the issues related to insufficient teaching staff, infrastructure and facilities faced by government schools in not so distant future. Amazing time ahead."
Wow!!!
"google AI team : 
overall this is benefit to overall humanity."
Can't wait for Open ai to make all the creators jobs obsolete too. 🤣
"Not only has AI the potential to be FAR better than the average teacher, but it also has the potential for free, personalized education tailored for the needs, strengths and weakenesses of every student. And you wont have to get a new 'teacher' every semester. Iy can follow your progress from learning multiplication tables all the way to multivariate calculus.

It can do all this 24h a day, no matter your financial situation, your geographical location and will never retire.

Its a massive win for humanity. Given time, it might even be as disrupting to education as the printing press."
"""You look lonely I can fix that"" typa vibes"
Literally amazing!
After eating up tuition teachers jobs Mr Khan is here to take it up to the next level
I wonder how this would deal with advanced calculus instead of simple trig
Asian dad at kitchen table at 10:49 pm mode would go absolute crazy
"Why teach anyone geometry, when the AI can solve all the math and geometry problems for you?"
Imagine AI teaching you in front of your dad and you miss it. 😆
"Thats Awesome , i think it's going to finish gemini"
Incredible
You may not understand the meaning of this yet but trust me this will me something you remember. It's going to be that important
Is this the end of Khan Academy? 😂
"The AI is much more stupid than you think and isn't going to help for specific questions. Despite all the optimists here, a machine learning model struggles HUGELY with questions being:
- open-ended (without a repository of math solutions to base its search off of)
- presented in a new/different format
- very contextualised
For math majors, this is pretty darn useless. Although its a breakthrough for introducing people to areas of math for sure. A massive problem I see is AI's tendency to be ""confidently wrong"" which might just confuse a beginner more than help... also it gets distracted by what you ask and might not solve for the fastest path of explanation.

TL;DR: Ideal for intro courses, rubbish for practical use."
GPT-4o should give the other person more time to express their thoughts. Not every student can immediately give a fully formulated answer.
"I haven't experimented with this yet, but chances are that this is a great helper for students when it comes to practicing examples or explaining a particular topic, but it is not a replacement for human teachers who build curriculums and tailor curated learning paths."
"Good start, albeit this is a basic problem that can barely be called math, but I learned to never underestimate ai"
How did they screw share in the iPad for GPT to view it?
Do you mean “maths”?
ask ChatGPT if it can shave that kid's unibrow
If it's good enough for Khan! It's good enough for me! 🤓 Very cool OpenAI!
this is insane
LOL.  This is the real live DEMO of the Hollywood acting demo from Google
Amen
Give him JEE Advanced questions then see your Gpt 4
RIP schools
"Byjus destroyed itself, before this cameout"
Goodness me
"How about the guys who are making the hologram technologies, we need you now."
now do integration by substitution or some permutations and combinations
I'm watching this video on the recommendation of Dr. Gaurav Garg Sir😊😊
Holy unibrow!
😢😂❤
gg for tuition companies
Dr. Gaurav Garg sir send me here ❤
"What would happen if they sell these data to 3rd parties? Just one time. Boom. Everything will be gone. These need a lot of security mechanisms. Just think for now, from just studying the way we are tapping screen, moving mouse point and typing on a keyboard companies send advertisment more accurately. They read out mind from just using that. If this much of data went out. That's it."
"lol everyone else who uses this will be like “I got this math problem, tell me the answer as quickly as you can as I have more problems for you to solve” r.i.p human intelligence we’re all going to slowly get dumber this way."
Now all that remains is to create a robot with this model so that it can work for me and bring in money 😂
"I didn't know a robot voice needed to take breaths. So are they just pretending it's an AI voice (but really a human) or is it actually AI and they added breath noise for added realism?
I hate how it's getting impossible to tell what's real and what's fake. If they can create realistic voices and video, how can you trust anything on the news anymore?"
How was the triangle and drawing done? Are those 2 separate windows one of a drawing app and one of Chatgpt?
"Kid: actually, can you give me the answer directly?
AI: Sure! I'd be happy to help! sin(alpha) would equal 7/25. Would you like me to solve the rest of this document?"
“I wish I was high on pot-enuse!”
Bye tutors.
Why do you have ads on your channel?
its that Google IO demo all over again ... but this time it might actually be used IRL ....
Google has work to do to catch you up😂
Human teacher for what??? Work for it? Vacation for the rest of your life? And who pays the bills? Open AI?
"1:00 - and it just happened, education is no longer a luxury. 

My kids will never go to university and waste their life and money."
"“I am become sentience, destroyer of jobs.”"
It would be better if you could give session with AI when student makes mistakes an AI try to correct him
Is this another fake like when actual people were speaking off-stage at other AI rollouts?! When will we find out? 😅
"This kinds of technology requires PElICANTHEORY.  Is peoples blind in America already? 

How many teachers and tutors get employed in this particular session of tutoring? 

AI people smart but fallen branch into a raging river because they're skipping the prerequisites.

⚖️They should give 10% in order to adjust the side effects that arise from such genius-ness."
"I look forward to this, technology is amazing!"
RIP tutors
RIP all tutors 
Exciting but centred on individualistic thinking with no consideration that society hasn’t been able to prepare what it will do to the collective (society). What will schools do and parents react when millions leave education for the 1-to-1 tutoring but lose the ability to relate to others?
"why is it condescending though 😅
Still, impressive"
wow it can do simple middle school trig!!!
Bro's named Enron. He has a 100% chance of trying to hide a mess under his bed when his parents tell him to clean his room
why to teach kids? if every work will be done by AI?
Exquisite 👌
Rip private tutors
"Very scripted on the human side of things. Also, people who are learning something don't naturally think aloud such organized thoughts about what they are doing - that's more of a teaching strategy than something people do when they're learning"
This is mindblowing!
You know what there is no fear of beating from teachers if you do wrong calculation or move thanks buddy
There goes my tutoring gigs.
Why do we need this? So we can cut down interaction between human? I don't like where this technology is heading but can't stop it
This is wonderful! Sal + OpenAI = a brighter future
played around w/ 4o and it seems to hallucinate a lot more than 4.0
this is concerning
"I'm concerned if Sal Khan's son actually doesn't know what a hypotenuse is or they're doing it for the video.
Edit: Grammar"
that 'tsck' was personally sarcastic man
Thank god I know how to farm
"Well , teachers are obsolete now..."
"Any of you guys seen that ""I gaslighted AI into saying 2+2=5"" video? 😂😂"
nah this is crazy
Please don't train your AIs to act so phony.
"RIP ""Rabbit R1"""
A great use case would be to see how it teaches the difference between parallelism and concurrency
Dad has NO FREAKIN' CLUE what's going on here 😂😂😂😂
"Damn, we're not going to need professors anymore......this is scary"
"""Great DE-DUCKS-SIN"" lol"
not khan asking his son to make mistakes on purpose lmao
"The most terrifying moment was at the end, at 3 minutes. When the voice praised him, she said great job etc, and they immediately felt happy and acknowledged. They showed by instinct real, human emotional responses to a programmed ""un-real"" thing. 
I am not sure we understand this aspect well enough. Robots can or will make use feel in a certain way, even when we know what's going on. It can really help lonely people - and yet, making them lonelier then before."
rip the teacher of math
I can feel Khan's disappointment on seeing that his son doesn't know what the hypotenuse is lol.
"Everybody, the future is now."
"Man, we're going to die pretty soon... sigh"
"But honestly, no one is gonna use this as a tutor. They will use it to get all the answers instead 😂😂"
Bye Bye Indian EdTech Industry
math tutors have left the chat
"I want to believe that all this will soon become available to everyone, and our children will listen to the stories of veterans who learned everything themselves, without anyone’s help ❤"
This is…glorious. Yall are making history and the future. Thank you.
"This is miles better than your average teacher, or learning in a classroom. Still, it's not better than being taught one on one by a really good teacher, because the AI would not be able to reliably answer any ""tangential"" doubts you may have or if you're curious to know more about something. For example, you might want to know why Trigonometry was created in the first place, who created it, how its applicable in real life, and any further doubts you may have regarding that. Because the AI can't grasp the human element behind creation of these concepts. 
But, I am positive that it will reach this level in the next couple of decades or less, given the astounding rate of development that we've seen since the past couple of years."
"idk why this feels so dystopian, maybe because it's so impersonal"
"it's the beginning of the end. I saw The Matrix recently, and this video really doesn't help the case 😭"
When will this feature be available?
Sal is one of the person I admire the most
"The thing is kids won't ask for homework help, they'll ask for answers"
"really looks this is heavily staged, like the who really underlines six times his answere in order to make sure the model get it right"
I wish I was HIGH on POTenus!!!
"Remember when the movie ""her"" was a sci fi movie? 10 years ago? Good times..."
"The new features certainly help but I've already been using GPT (4. 3 was pretty bad in comparison.) heavily instead of tutors or secondary literature (that may or may not contain what you want to know) for almost a year now.
It's been so helpful that I wonder how things would've gone without. I probably would've still passed my classes but I wouldn't have understood nearly as much."
Really awesome
goodbye school teachers :)
What is the Turkish comment you are looking for here?
is this bye bye job for teachers and tutors???
🤡 that boy doesn't know hypotenuse seriously
Free 🇵🇸
What’s ALPHA!!! 😂
Great concept!
Teaching jobs are already at risk…!!!
"Great, finally!
something to rediscover maths :)"
"they uused the chatgpt mug, so its a commercial lol"
RIP teaching profession
These technologies are making human impotent.
BROOOOOOOOOO. BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOawoawAWOO. Terminator vibes
"GPT-4o replaced the teacher.
GPT-5 will replace the student.😮"
Insane
this set up is just bullying google bard rofl
"Ah OpenAI, ending teacher's careers, one day at a time! :)"
can someone tell me what app he's using? how did he set that up?
Wow!
I'm curious about how the american education system will adapt & what form it will take in developing countries.
why does she speak like a Fallout robot... Omg the future is going to be insane...
"yeah all good for 2+2 ,but it still cant do my physics homework ,well done chat gpt you still suck at physics now i have to do all that work on my own... 🤣😂"
If I had this technology 20 years ago my parents would be so proud 😂
"I love the video. But I can't help thinking ""Hello AI, can you teach our children a skillset that will be made obsolete by your own advancements in just a few years?"""
now help me with integration
Waiting for the Scarlet Johansen voice module.
Pandit Badri Prasad Har Har Bhole
bye bye teachers
Welp school is useless now
"Did she say ""high on potenuse""??? 😀"
Boosting education only to know you are sitting jobless in future . 🤧
That's great but GPT3.5 still can't do an integral without inventing new maths
Teaching and private tutors industry is dead after today. Say goodbye to your jobs :P
Let me give you my 11th physics problems😂
Bye bye tutors
"I'm a teacher. I'm boggled. I'm wondering if I'll have a job in 10 years. This is far, far better than the average teacher out there."
Why I feel it became worse?!
That is so creepy. I never thought this would be possible in real life
What the frick
Incredible feat
where are super cooked
"Rip, the math tutoring business"
"the AI forgot to use the inverse function of sine yo calculate the angle , still not very advances hope it will in the future"
This can  do by  5 th class students in India 😂😂
"RIP government teachers around the globe. Why have a teacher in a room of 20, or more, and hold up the class for the bottom few not understanding something? I remember in my first year of college my math class having maybe 200 students and some girl couldn't understand that -10 and +10 were the same variant from 0. We spent over 5 minutes out of our time on this one ""problem"".  It's like homeschooling for all. Advance at your own pace and leave the slow kids behind. Teachers are baby sitters and they are obsolete. They will only be with the special needs kids at the government schools soon."
💀
im pretty worried
he has an eyebrow!
"Remarkable, it sounds like u're almost talking to a human being."
I can't wait to have AI friends tbh
me in 50 years: “I remember in my day when all my teachers were analog”
What are they feeding these computers and when can I have it
Gg sir🌝
Is this available now? Confused as it on the iPad and he’s using a pen.
Tutoring will be gone completely
Ngl I can't wait for the apocalypse.
bruh elon will be very angry after watching this.
Unbelievable!
Holy moly
"Crazy to think that my kid, when it goes to school in two years, will live with AI day by day… it’s spooky"
How to get access to GPT-4o?
Ai can not teach maths like indian jee teacher like mohit tyagi
O.M.G. we are living in the future
"Bro that's very easy you're complicating it, just remember one line ""Pandit Badhri Prasad Har Har Bole Sona Chandi Tole"".
This line get me through my high school."
And now that you've learned basic trigonometry ... let's proceed to make your career choices obsolete.
"If there was one thing that this video did for me, then it was showing me how horrible iPadOS is, you can't even have such an app as a interactive widget or smart assistant, you have to use non customizable split screen"
This is basically the simplest math problem in the world with a fancy chat bot
Khan really agreed to promote the product that inevitably will take his job
This is kind of crazy.
that's some pretty impressive tts
"It was artists, now it is RIP teachers."
😮😮😮😮
OpenAI  - taking your jobs one at a time!
"This will give back so much time to parents!
More time for us enjoying OUR free time😂😂😂"
"I am filled with so much wonder and existential dread. This isn’t just software, it’s mass producible intelligence."
Do we really need teachers at this point?
This will revolutionise schools
But the problem is how to import the problem into it.
I found my new Universal professor
Insane to think that the new generation will not know the feeling of tears falling onto your notebook the night before the exam
Salute to this man 🫡
AI gasping for air while conversing (significantly at 3:00). Was it a feature to pass Turing test?
"Damn, the way ChatGPT is talking is totally human, even I heard her taking a deep breath while conversating, this is damn awsome!!!!!!"
That’s crazy
Liked the way ai offered encouragement and praise alongside in the right way.
I like how he used red color for wrong answers and blue for correct ones xD.
open AI is great . we are freinds
Lol whats the point even if AI is going to take everyone's jobs? This announce series is crazy!
"my fucking god, we are fucked"
慘了，老師不知道怎麼教小孩了
"1:45 That thing can breath, AI's weakness is finally revealed! Just cut the air supply and humanity's saved :D"
i love how indian startups are going to get affected with this because I don't like how much they much on entrance exams and not push on the idea developing children to really understand what they like or not
"They should test what kids are actually gonna be asking. ""Explain this trig problem in terms of skibidi toilet"" type shit."
"If this guy hadn't specifically told it not to, it would have just given the answers right away and the kid wouldn't have learned anything."
The parents are so useless the Ai has to come in and help 😂
Schooling is going to change drastically.
Feeling like watching 2 actor acting
Tutors are cooked 😂
"bye bye "" math  teachers """
it cant solve JEE problems lmfaooooo
Wow
"Hlw GPT-4o , Please make it free for middle class family like us 🙂"
They're using a lot of apple products in these demo's... wonder why
"The father seems pretty convinced and impressed too xD
Wish I had this when I was a kid"
"Drake smiling in the corner, Kendrick must be fuming after seeing this 😂"
Interactive AI in conventional schooling out
"You are my only one, in the sky"
Dumb thing.
AGI in Maximum of 10 years
Khan academy!! Foundations
(sssssssss!!)-🐍
We do not need teacher in the next 2 or 3 years
OH SHIT IT DROPPED
Is this only through ChatGPT 4o's interface (on a browser) or through Khan Academy's?
Gourav sir ne shikha real me bhut realistic voice 👍👍
"This is great but people are forgetting that 90% of American kids are addicted to TikTok, YouTube & Instagram.

The modern day problem is now discipline & actually doing the work (which most people can't do).

There will always be a way to differentiate the A+ kids from the C- kids."
Feeling no stress about learning is the best part of this technology
We are so duck 🦆📴 ....  😅😢😂😂😂
I’m quitting my CS master study and starting a career in McDonald’s..
Gaurav Sir has sent it brother 🤗
We have created a monster... . Only... it doesn't know what it is yet :)
oh my God!
"We're Doomed, it's no longer in 50 years time... it's in next 5 years time, we could be doing... 😭"
Teachers are cooked
"This is paradigm shifting:

We all know that socio-economic status plays a large role in quality of education. Often, students from poorer families receive less opportunities to succeed when compared to the more well-off community.

This allows students from less advantageous backgrounds to get an on-the-go tutor that can understand their flaws and provide meaningful guidance in subjects they struggle with for incredibly cheap (relatively speaking). This elevates such children in a significant manner that will help them bridge one of the gaps in their educational potential.

Un-freakin-real!"
All private tutors should start sending their cv's to mcdonalds
First we train them. And then they train us. Let's see who's going to do it better and what the result will be 😊
It was having a conversation with another AI before you interrupted it.  And now it's going to take tutor jobs.
"We won’t have this in Europe because of AI Act..
Hopefully this will be solved in the next months"
We got Khan Academy Ray Romano before GTA 6 😭
"Imagine what it'll be like in 10 years... 
I'd imagine someone will comment something under this in 10 years."
"Me, on the right, who doesn't have to tutor his brother, on the left, anymore:"
"just as tiktok reduced our attention span, there will now be a generation of kids that will start talking over one another without patience. hearing politicians speak over one another is painful enough. OpenAi, please change this behavior in your model, before it becomes a common practice."
"Kota , byjus .. tough time😅"
this is CRAZY
"If you are upgrading gpt4 this much, shouldn't you consider to update gpt 3.5 little bit simultaneously😵‍💫"
"Hey Sam Altman,you do your best to provide education to world,thankyou for your such efforts❤❤❤"
"Beware teachers, you're not needed anymore!"
She is better than my mom when she teaches me 👹👹
"I am happy for the new generation, this tool will change the world in the long term as Sam altman said. We will get better and high quality education now for everbody. It means less crime and less war for the future"
"meanwhile ChatGPT 3.5 cant sum some numbers...

Edit: for all who wounder: GPT-4 can do sum my numbers i tried."
The voice and how it's saying stuff sounds like a mix of the Portal voice and a Vault Tec commercial from Fallout.
This is bad for the world. In 10 years imagine all the issues this causes to the world. Technology will kill humanity.
Teachers are going to be out of a job VERY SOON.
Jesus - this is going to groundbreaking
dr. Gaurav garg sir recommended this video🤟
Cortana is here :D
"Imagine advertising the sole thing that could overtake your career and make your job obsolete, repect Khan academy fr"
no way
I think this chatgpt will replace all teachers from school to college😊😊
Who came here after gautam girg sir's suggestion to watch the video ....😄
what is the app that they are using for drawing?
Gaurav sir has sent
AI is still just scary shit to me.
So you guys are advertising that AI can teach you what hypotenuse is in 3 minutes? good job lololol
Can we get all senior executives to train gpt. This way we can replace it
"Bye Teachers, Professors, Doctors, anyone making a living in Information or Education."
Can this boy read a book?
Humane pin but realllll
how would you even set GPT up to work like this on an ipad. like the whole split screen thing
imagine such AI in a video game
Khan gonna be out of a job man
"""Good work! Now be so kind to establish a Skynet corporation for me please."""
*Who else is here after Gaurav Sir's recommendations ?*
we're cooked
Love to see Sal 😍
"This is such a huge paradigm shift for education. For science, for humanity! ❤🎉"
Bro it's still unable to solve basic questions of JEE.....😂
The way the voice works is really great!
"this is just game changing. Few more videos to go, I have to watch the rest

Imagine this paired with games 😍"
he kinda sounds like the khan academy guy
His son looks ridiculously smart
It's too humanee !!!!!! No I can't differentiate between a human and gpt now 🥲
This was amaaaaaaazing 😮😮😮😮 i just vant believe this shit is happening 😮
"well poor boy, and good luck teaching Nigeria's children this way. no way."
2:04 great deducson
"It's not published yet, is it? I can't find the function in the iPad app and I'm a plus user 👀"
"I really hope we don't need to wait months for this, let's just start releasing it out ASAP"
Sid the Ai just “tch” at 0:43?
OpenAI copied Rabbit R1 and the Rabbit doesn't need a scamming subscription.
"If everybody uses this for education, there is a chance for many many people to lose their jobs in schools and other educational government stuff
But openai's technology is really impressive and shocking"
i wonder if you can tell it to respond in a shorter manner without all the politeness..etc...
Can the general public try this today for free?
i would suck at maths if it weren't for sal khan; i owe him so much
"On the other hand, I think it's going to become increasingly difficult to create an AI with a flop like Doraemon."
"Remember guys, they faked the sora demo"
Requiring human interaction of any kind is becoming obsolete.
"AI was inevitable, as a parent who has struggled with finding professional tutors, who actually cared about teaching, I understand, appreciate and is thankful for AI technology. Khan academy was average, his videos were dry, monotonous and not engaging for majority of students. Khan realizes a potential threat, rightfully so, emotions aside, knowledge is open source for everyone, convenient affordable tutoring at your disposable."
GUYS!! WE ARE FACING WITH FUTURE EDUCATION RIGHT NOW!
WOWOWWOW
"sorry but ""you close"" , if you got 1/3 chance of guessing the right side"
RIP teachers
Just teach SOH-CAH-TOA chatgpt. That is all.
GPT 3 can do that too. make it tutor something like polynomial division. GPT manages to always mess it up
Thanks gaurav sir
NGL i expected khanacademy's son to be doing indefinite integrations at this point 😂
"I'd love to see it tutor a problem in more advanced maths and without it knowing the problem beforehand, ie you describe the problem or write it down theb proceed"
this is fucking nuts
your son nimrod
RIP to teaching job
I think he's going to explode trying to help me with my prep school physics class.
I love Khan!!
Kid blinks in morse code
Bye teachers. Please know you were useless during this time 👋
"khan was getting sus when she said ""PURRfect ;3""

2:24"
Come on guys... This is not the real use case... 90 percent of the students will just ask what the solution of the problem is... Thats it 😂😂😂
My mind just exploded
Now chatgpt will be islam.
Is it publicly available? When can we test it?
This will revolutionize the prn and sxbot industry. My gud!
so... AI gonna teach our kids now
we're fckd
Why do you need to learn anything anymore
the fakest conversation ever 💀
"wow, now teach me residue theorem"
Kid is cute as hell❤❤
"The problem isn't that people are going to lose their jobs. The problem is kids are going to think AI can't be wrong, or have limited information at the moment its being used."
I used to teach struggling kids and make money. Now it's all over.
Could you please take over the world a bit slower so that I can adapt?
Still requires supervising😂 lately it learned something human
Awesome technology
"""Robert is UNLEASHING THE FUTURE! Harnessing the unparalleled power of GPT-4o, he's creating revolutionary voice and vision-enabled smart agents that will RESHAPE THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR EXISTENCE  a world where intelligent automation transforms every aspect of life and work! $ABT"
"I am excited to see GPT-4o , help us to solve JEE- Advanced Question ."
This the kind of stuff you'd see in the early 2000s Disney futuristic shows and movies. 😂
"You might think teachers are going to be out of a job. However if AI can teach humans better than most humans can, then that will be beneficial to humanity.

There are many complex subjects for where there are only a few expert teachers in the world who are eloquent enough to explain the subject matter in a comprehensive way.

Through AI like this we will now all have access to such teachers in abundance."
Pretty cool how it uses a voice intonation geared towards a young learner.
"now adays I spend my time correcting chat gpt, it makes mistake alot, so I started scolding it now I don't use it"
it sounds like teacher before taking students doubts
"Wow, just wow"
Insane 🤯
"This is probably the best case scenario.  Got to try it in real life and not believe ad from company.  

AI can be completely wrong about stuff too.  I been using Co-Pilot AI and it can save a Lot of time vs Google searching since it can pull relevant data from multiple sites at once and output it in a natural human language. The issue is that it can get stuff so wrong."
me playing the video through multiple times to try and spot any imperfections in the video. (I can't help but think that this whole video is AI-generated)
Rip teachers.
"We're living in the future, now 🔥"
Traditional education will be destroyed in a few years because of this and that's a good thing. The cost of education has always been a bottleneck.
"Now, all those AI interpretation in video games and novels are becoming true, I dont know man its just weird to think about it"
How about make the voice less obviously annoying
too bad my final for calc is over
so cool
Goodbye teachers! What about collecting recyclables in the streets? It's a better profession!
Yeah were done. The movie Her from 2013 is real now.
Come from Gaurav Garg sir
Suggested by gaurav Garg sir to watch it.... really loved to see how it works ❤
RIP jobs
"Will be the first to comment that this technology will not be applicable like video shown until at least 10 years in the futute - Hope to be proven wrong, but AI right now is just getting delusional by questions and prompts way too quickly from my experience"
time to enter the dune timeline
Wakanda school principal: it seems cheaper to subscribe to A.I than the salary of an honorary teacher 😢
Can you show something that isn't basic trig.... Maybe something with a proof of graph theory??? Would actually be helpful.
Lol they choose the easiest problem as the demo 😂😂 i like how the kid purposely tries to get the hypotenuse wrong
more on RIP college
Bye bye private tutors
Great acting :)
Khan? 😂😂
Better than a school teacher.
"This is going to be an amazing aid for children, especially when you're not understanding a subject and the parent is getting frustrated by the child. This will save a lot of yelling. Lol..."
"I'll be impressed when it can teach and solve algebra, calculus, and differential equations"
this is amazing
Better than any teacher I ever had in any public school which GPT has just rendered obsolete.
whether it can solve the integral ??
"Finally we can get rid off Asian parent teaching but also yelling ""How could you be so stupid"" at you at the same time ."
"Ok, now I am sure they are working with Apple."
Sals investment in chat gpt was great move
How to make Chat gpt „see“ something?
No jobs are safe
"wow i actually thought the women speaking was a real women doing tutor job in openai , this is crazy but imagine how in future jobs will be gone maybe"
I believe Wolfram alpha has been doing this since 2005
We're cooked
"this feature hasn’t rolled out yet, right?"
yeah i think no body would ask this level of difficulty.. it's too damn difficult
But the AI is doing Sal’s job!! Why is he helping it??
Here after Dr. gaurav garg sir's current affair video lecture...
This is so cool and scary at the same time
Imran Khan is fun to say.
"In these math demos gpt4o teaches textbook style, instead of guiding the student to understand math more intuitively"
"I just want to thank Sal Khan from the bottom of my heart for his academy. I keep fond memories of all the math and geometry lessons I watched there years ago, that helped me relearn what I had long forgotten, so I could be able to help out my daughter with her homework, and all for free. In a world of greed and ignorance, this man is a precious gift."
"thats a proof of concept really, more than anything impressive. The problem should at least have 2 steps"
wow impressive
"RIP Dad math tutors ⚰.  ""Can you teach my Son math, but make him cry before solving the problem?"""
I have a gpt subscription but how do i get this back and forth without having to manually press record...?
"That's so incredible the way chat GPT sounds like a real person tutor, and it does an excellent job explaining math problems. How did they train a model like this? It's beyond my wildest dream for sure. This definitely gives an end to the math tutor side job for students to begin with. And I wonder what's the next incredible thing that AI can do?"
Rip high school teacher jobs😢
"This is amazing, now, about he ATOMIC BOMB, let's start with where i can get Plutonium...oh, btw, can you keep this between us?"
Is this app available yet? I don't see the option to draw like this in the chat gpt app?
You need to get a kid who really needs help and not someone who is pretending they don't get it. But it's still amazing what it can do
RIP highschool RIP college XD
This really killed my team's tech startup idea
Me showing my teacher this to prove my phone is smarter than him
it's over for us
end to personal tutoring business?
This AI is gonna put Khan Academy out of business brooo 😔😭😭
goodbye school :(
"Finally, I can have a patient teacher that won't hit me out of frustration and shout profanities at me."
rip to the teachers and professors. The world is slowly turning into DETROIT BECOME HUMAN
"The past 2 years have shown me education, as I knew it growing up, is basically finished now. Its a great way to meet people but why listen to a 67 year old professor when you can speak to AI"
"I for one welcome this age of self learning and critical thinking, finally books and knowledge will become available like never before."
"This is perfect, this model came out right as I am about to start studying for the mcat and take physics over summer"
Didn't expect to see Khan here 😂
This is what’s getting baked into iPadOS 18 natively
I am ready to see the world where all kids have this. But I am also expecting we are in for some nasty surprises with the average intellect going up too fast for the world to adapt.
My child gose to ai school.
"I like the fact that when it's talking, if you start speaking, it stops and waits for your response. Google assistant never did that lol."
RIGHT AFTER THE DANG AP CALCULUS EXAM TEST?!💀💀💀💀Thats so foul. 😭
"Math tutoring is almost exclusively what I use AI for, I just really enjoy math and am super excited and this update"
imran is goated fr
Rockman.Exe coming real. I wish I was born 20 years later
How do we download it please. I checked on Playstore and Apple Store but can’t find it
RIP the entire educational system
How is the bot registering his pen movements? Is it from a third person view camera or reading the screen internally?
Mind Blowing
"Overhyped, this thing is still WIP"
Mind blowing
Now this is AI for good
cringeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"This is actually a historical turn we are witnessing right now. I can already imagine this evolving into something as large and intelligent as the fictional ""JARVIS"" and ""FRIDAY"". This combined with the ability to interact with the physical world and make real world decisions with all the information of world, its history, it's past every scientific knowledge and research in its head accessible in a second, its gonna be an engineering Marvel"
this is so nice its very hard to find teaher in india and maths is so hard to teach my son always ask question and i dont have answer to it this will help so much thank u for this
"me immediately I saw this, SOHCAHTOA, God bless my teacher"
When your GPU becomes your teacher
🥺🥲
We want this kind of learning and studying by our own and a genius helper not just lecturing us and make our mind sleepy.
Holy shit😮😅
Real life tutors exist you know… My math tutor in high school was legally blind and rode a bicycle to meet me at the library. He was also a professional black jack player.
"There are approx. 42,000 math tutors currently employed in the US, earning $25 - $80 per hour.  Those jobs just evaporated.  Big round of applause Sam Altman."
gotta give an oscar to this lad
"I'm sceptic that this is real, but if it is 😮"
Wish ai was there in my uni days.
"teachers think this is going to help them, NO this is going to REPLACE THEM!"
"Great work of all participants. Great work of openAI. This has got a power to change the world entirely, how we have known it to these days. Fantastic work and results!!👍👌👏"
Chat gpt is growing faster than the scifi authors told us the AI would be
Holy hype this is amazing
"Learning is going to be so much easy and so much fun with AI , it’s epic times we live in. 😍😍"
"Desperately want to point out that his son's name is ""Imran Khan"""
"For thousands of years, reason and calculation have been a distinctive feature of humanity, and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, artificial intelligence came to demand it from us. What will the next millennia bring us?"
Sal Khan is still my favorite online tutor
Not even close to my tutoring skills
Skynet is improving so fast
It's really waw .
RIP TEACHERS
Such a shit problem bro we here in india learn this in 4th grade lmao
Interesting. Now please let us see the behavior of the AI with an intransigent student who persistently complains that they don't know and that they can't do it.
Weed son
"You're making it way too easy for the AI. I would like to know how good it is in a real world scenario, not one where everything is so carefully planned."
RIP teacher occupation
"As a teacher, I'm so glad I plan on leaving teaching, because this is better than at least 30% of the teachers I know."
"I get the feeling it takes video in at a very slow frame rate, like maybe one frame every two or three seconds. That’s why the kid held his pen over the sides for a very long time drawing up-and-down repeatedly to make sure it saw it. I’m still super impressed though and obviously this will keep getting better."
"Good luck, Teachers in profession 🤣"
The intonations are as intimidating as my math teacher's!
what kind of sorcery is this ?
"University 1000m

GPT 4 free 

Why do I need to go again 😅"
This is unbelievable! Congrats!
ChatGPT will teach kids wrong math with full confidence.
Those new GPU’s are witchcraft I swear 😂😂
"yeah , as a mathematician . i can tell you that there is a point where this IA . can't even begin or start a true high  level abstract  complex math probleme . and it'll be cringe to see ."
I wonder how long until it becomes annoying. We know it's a non-robotic robot voice 😂
"This is excellent tool for far flung remote areas where education rate is very low.
We could have more engineers, scientist, doctors and so on.
Awesome tool. Love it. ❤"
"Hey GPT, what's the Hamiltonian of a simple harmonic oscillator, solve for the constants of motion."
Crazy….Skynet in 5 yrs
She may just be the most humble and heartwarming person there is❤️❤️❤️
HAL9000
get me off this ride I want OUT
"Wonder if my child will be left with any job opportunities other than AI building or even worse, not even that."
"After watching all the 4o videos, Google Assistant uninstalled itself"
Wild...
How can we get it?
Future is only imagination until someone builds it. Hats off to you Open Ai. What a time to be alive!
Came in with my expectations being zero...now I'm leaving in shock 😲
Wow 😮
can i use this to teach me how to draw??
Wish I had this 😢
"I asked chat gpt "" What is the LCM of 1 and √2?"" It literally said √2 😂"
Omg that was the toughest question humanity has ever seen 🍻
0:30 the moment the kid started stressing out
its weird how human it sounds
it speaks and explains a thousand times better than my teachers 😵‍💫
The AI talks more like a human than a human himself
"Here is are three new words for teachers, redundant, superfluous and.....unemployed!"
"What is the app they’re using that allows this interaction?

Like ChatGPT + the math app?"
I would love something a bit less polite... Like my Latino teachers: I told him that the hypotenuse was this!!! what a bastard 🥲
What will teachers and tutors do now. It's exciting but also very concerning.
"**Enhancing AI Interactivity with Audio and Video Feedback Loops**

The evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational agents, has been rapid and remarkable. With the recent advancements in GPT-4O (Omni), the capabilities of AI have expanded beyond text processing to include multimodal inputs such as images and audio. However, there remains significant potential for further enhancement, particularly through the implementation of audio and video feedback loops.

**The Concept of Feedback Loops**

A feedback loop, in the context of AI, refers to the process where an AI system can receive and process its own outputs. For instance, when an AI generates audio responses, these could be looped back into the system, allowing it to ""hear"" itself. Similarly, for visual outputs, the AI could ""see"" its own video responses. This concept is analogous to how humans perceive their own voices and visual presence, enabling adjustments in real-time to improve clarity, tone, and emotional expressiveness.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Audio Feedback Loop**: 
   - The AI's audio output would be fed back into its own auditory processing unit. By analyzing its own voice, the AI could adjust parameters such as pitch, tone, and volume to better match the intended emotional tone or to improve mimicry of specific voices.
   - This requires the integration of advanced auditory feedback systems and real-time processing algorithms to allow immediate adjustments. For instance, machine learning models trained on voice modulation could provide instant feedback and corrective measures.

2. **Video Feedback Loop**: 
   - Similar to the audio loop, the video output generated by the AI could be fed back into its visual processing systems. This would enable the AI to assess the quality of its visual responses, such as facial expressions or gestures if anthropomorphic avatars are used.
   - Implementing this would involve integrating video analysis tools that can evaluate and enhance visual output in real-time, ensuring that the visual cues are consistent with the spoken content and emotional tone.

**Benefits of Feedback Loops**

1. **Improved Realism**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting its own outputs, the AI can produce more human-like interactions. This is particularly important for applications requiring high emotional intelligence, such as virtual assistants or customer service bots.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users are likely to find interactions more engaging and satisfactory if the AI can adjust its tone and visual cues to better match the context of the conversation.
3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Feedback loops can help maintain consistency in voice and visual presentations, reducing the likelihood of jarring discrepancies in long conversations.

**Future Directions**

Incorporating feedback loops is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with the ongoing efforts to make AI more interactive and responsive. As AI technologies continue to evolve, such features could become standard, leading to interactions that are indistinguishable from human communication. The development of these systems requires collaboration between audio-visual engineers, AI researchers, and user experience designers to create holistic solutions that enhance AI's capabilities and usability.

In conclusion, the integration of audio and video feedback loops into AI models like GPT-4O represents a significant step towards more natural and effective human-AI interactions. This enhancement not only promises to improve the technical performance of AI systems but also has profound implications for their acceptance and integration into daily life."
sounds like dora the explorer.
Why is study not happening?
"If I was a kid, I would trade my old hag boring math teacher with this perky AI teacher and only go to class to socialize 😂"
We all know Khan's son's already writing his PhD thesis for mathematics and is just pretending to not know the sides of a triangle for us dumbdumbs.
This video is like a window in the future. I can see AI teaching our kids one day. Awsome job as usual from OpenAI.
I think God smiles upon humanity's inventive spirit and is thrilled with our groundbreaking achievements.
This is freaking amazing :o
Tell ironman that Jarvis can pack his bags.
Khan! good platform you have
my god this shit is going to revolutionize the world
I wonder why they didn’t try to have it evaluate the arc sine… oh wait…
"Okay. Now do multiplication and division, in the kitchen of course, trying to help them figure out, without shouting, ""How many times can you fit 6 into 42!?"". Literally impossible. or at least my father would say"
Did they hire the same marketing team that google did when they annonced Gemeni ?
"It's amazing that while others are afraid of being left behind, Khan is always pushing forward with the latest technology to make learning better and more accessible for everyone. Amazing job, Imran, Sal and GPT-4o 😃"
😮 there’s another profession on the wires 😅 bye bye Tutors 😳
Khan's Son forced to tell wrong answer so that they can show us how gpt will guide him to correct answer 😂
The thing we wish we had 10 years ago
It sounds like real life Dora
"The real question: ""Are you on OnlyMaths?"" 😂"
Inb4 they ask AI for the nuclear launch codes
When I was a kid all I had was a couple of sets of outdated and incomplete encyclopedias.
Lets keep this unknown (im a math tutor)
Technology continues to make things slower and inefficient. It will increase accessibility hopefully (silver lining)
Chatgpt won't be able to touch jee advanced questions😂😂
How i can do that ?
0:45 The intonation is crazy.
"You are close 
There are just three sides 😂"
I have come here on the advice of Gaurav Sir.
RIP TEACHERS 😐
I thought the guy on the right was learning too but then I realized who it was
"Even the voice, damn."
Remember Skynet? It's close... it's very close.
new ai funna make me act up. better chill with that tone
yall specifically invited him to tell your job is over 😭
It's good to see GPT 4o being helpful for students (if the students are trying to do their homework on their own).
"Good teacher , I mean gpt4o 😂😂"
Aint no way its this fast
The AI sounds like it had just tutor 7.000 kids in a row. Can’t catch a break
i'd better plan for an early retirement packing before the age of 40 i'll be out of a job 🙃 (i'm currently a maths tutor)
Hi gwmebiooen ai bante
There is no AI smart enough to teach me math.
"Heres a plot twist. When AI becomes this intelligent in mainstream use, learning math will be stupid. Human do not need to spend time anymore learning ANYTHING in math that is not adding and substrancting."
The beginning of the end of Chegg.
PETITION TO MAKE AI MUSIC GENERATOR!!!
soon I say goodbye to my grumpy old college teacher and replace it with this AI that don't have to scream at me each time i get the answer wrong and instead guides me to the right answer
"I am in shock at the possibilities this presents for humanity.....

And imagine if we could fit all this into a gadget? Without servers, an autonomous mass product, with all the knowledge, history and technology for all time.....
Whatever happens to humanity, this knowledge would not be lost. People would be able after any disaster - and wheat to grow and grind it, and bake bread. Instantly get any blueprint for a building and the necessary infrastructure.

I dream that it would be autonomous, without a centralized server. Pray develop processors and memory. 😳"
Didn’t know who that was until he opened his mouth.  Then it was clear
IT CAN TALK?
Skynet is coming😂😂😂
kid be like : I don't know which one is the hypotenuse but I'm sure that the formula for sin is o/h
Incredible! there are no words....
this is nuts
"We all know that sal was cursing gpt 4 in his mind, for stealing his job 😂"
This is wild! This means every kid can have a personal tutor who is infinitely patient and guides them in exactly the way they need at any time day or night. That is such a game-changer and finally gives everyone access to the highest quality education regardless of social status! 🤯
Now can you imagine what AI will do in 10 years? Either we will be slave or go extinct.
Dr. Gaurav Garg has sent it to me.
Let’s close the academies haha.
Maths tutors see what is happening 😮
How do we access?
KhanGPT. The future of education! ❤
"""AI will never replace teachers""


HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAAHHAHAHAHAHBAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAJAJAJAHHAHAHHAHAHABAHA"
Is that Scarlett Johansson?
Wish I had that when I was in school/college 😭
This Ai sounds more human than actually human himself
"And yet people are commenting, such a shame, it cannot solve Laplace equation"
No teacher will sleep tonight
Gen-Z' millenial parents are still feeling helpless after all this help.
"The AI with the female voice already has an attitude because she got cut off?
Damn that shit is realistic... 🤣🤣"
young djokovic doing side quests
May I also be invited to try this? I'd love to and can think of many things to do with it and ways to test it and push it further
Can't believe you guys made a better sounding better version of the Google assistant in a few years and Google couldn't do anything for the past 10 years
Is this available for normal plus users yet? I haven’t been able to figure it out as of yet.
"Well I am also using chatgpt for my studies it still has some flaws in mathematics and physics but still provides a path which is correct but the calculations most of the time is wrong but that's not even a problem, it's most helpful in chemistry like subjects helps to build concept if you do cross questions with it."
"who is gpt-4o talking to at 00:20 to 00:23, and why is it talking at all?"
Study iq
Omg😮😮😮 am blown away .. so good and awesome ..
Waiting for this almost half a decade now.
"Well, that seems made-up to me, I can’t believe this kid cannot find the hypothenus by himself and solve that ridiculously simple ""math"" problem. That apart, assuming nothing else is made up, the interaction is interesting. I’d prefer to see it do a real math problem, tho."
I am totally down with this application.
"I'm sorry I can't with the kid's unibrow. On the other hand, as a math and comp sci major, I can't wait for this to help me with my Fourier Analysis class."
damn
give some calculus then lets see..
"Come from Dr Gaurav Garg sir 
Study IQ"
The future is truly here. Amazing
JEE Adv in Danger
The schools need to reform. This might be the school  of the future!
LOL TEACHERS GG
"Focus on engineering problem please, the Ai is very week in solving a little bit complicated maths"
That is unbelievable!!!
This will end so much abuse
This is craaazyyyy
jesus
Imagine how effective this will be at teaching language
Want to try jee advanced math problems
"Since this is free. GPT learning from the biggest library in existence (aka, the Internet)

Has access to public college level stuff (Melinda Gates foundation publicized college books for free on the internet)

Meaning college is free yeah?
We just need to prove our skills through exams"
"bro that Idddentifiiie at 0:46 is craaaaazy.
obviously this entire video is insane, but that one is just special."
This is going to revolutionize the entire educational system.
Is it available in Hinglish?
"It’s like having the Teacher next to him, somebody who is explaining the problem…it’s not bad…"
HOLY MOLY!!
Your gpt is  incapable of solving jee advance question😂😂
School's permanently out
Does anyone know how they share screen with GPT? Thanks!
As if this kid doesn’t know which side is the hypotenuse 😂
"AI will teach AI, and skynet will be initiated!"
This is wild !
of course indians
And i found why my kid are very Weak in mathematics.
mind blown
"We need to see AI doing engineer maths, calculus 3... That could be real fun!"
Can it be done with my engineering math problems?
"So, in the other demo they copied code to have GPT explain it instead of screen sharing - why?"
Goodbye teachers
"This is impressive but don't forget that llms make mistakes so it does work on this kind of easy problem, but i'm not sure how it will handle more complicated challenges."
what's a home tutor?
De Turks and Jerbs!
is it capable to do complicated problems?
She exudes an elegant charm and carries herself with the grace and pride of a true queen.❤️❤❤
"Okay, but when my kids do math, they do a lot of ""Uuuugggh,"" and ""I don't want to DO this,"" and ""this is so stupid."" ... Can it help with that?"
Dawg I thought that was Vikstar in the thumbnail
Imagine being Khan's son and having to listen to your dad teach you everything all day everyday! Sheesh. Incredible demo too though!
rip teachers
literally an ad for Apple iPad pro 🤣
The real time response is really cool.
Can you describe the exact technical set up they are using? What is running on the iPad? I'd like to mimic it and test it with other problems
You brought Sal from Khan Academyyyyyyyyy Amazing!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
How is this done? How do you share the screen on the iPad?
udemyGPT
THATS NOT BAD VERY NICE THATS THE FUTURE PEOPLE ACCEPT IT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wildly impressive !
What program they are using to do the math?
That is as cool as it is creepy honestly.
What about Khanmigo
i wish i had these shits in my high school.
Can’t wait until I lose my job too!
"I remembered the scene from Big Bang Theory wherein Raj Kothrapalli fancies siri . I think a similiar trend might appear now , AI girlfriend . Good for Introverts and weirdoes!."
anyone noticed AI taking breath-in during convo...?
I know Khan offered some learning material to OpenAI to train the model.
Why would we need to learn sin alpha when he grows up you won't need to know shit just get waited on by computers
Why bother !
If Khan thinks that's good for his own son it's more than good for the rest of us
i hate all of this
You are close. Your error was the maximum possible.
Is this a joke?
Omw to be the worst engineer of all time 🙏
"The son is experiencing tics , because he consciously knows that  there is a camera observing him"
I guess we can shift from a college fund for our kids to a Trade School fund. That'll probably not be replaced by AI.
"thank god, now my son can do his homework on his own! 
one job down for me, waiting to lose my real job soon!"
Oh how I’ll miss the late night dinner table tutoring with dad 😭
How is this not AGI? Where will the goal post shift now?
☠💀💀💀💀💀
🤯
OMFG the teacher will be fired
Wow and it’s better than my teacher
"Tsk
Wtf that was smooth"
It's at least 30 years too soon for this. 😂
This Service is free??
"Gaurav sir has sent✌️
Its genius"
Wow that would help me alot with my igcse maths
How can I access it? I still see only GPT 3.5
"The new model is not what's impressive. What I'm impressed with is the image generation shown on their website. It can literally generate 3D models and text perfectly, it's absolutely insane."
I think this could do for teachers what online shopping and delivery has done for retail... remove the abuse from the equation. If this were implemented in such a way as to show exactly what a kid did and when there could be no deflected blame.
WTH WTH WTH WTH......
Jarvis?
Chatgpts really said 'Tsk' in tbe beginning 😂
"Damn, wish I had that back in the days when I went to school, would’ve been a straight A student😂😂"
"Great, no need to go to school anymore!"
Wow 🤯
"Living in a simulation now, broskies 😂"
those asians be like: Using artificial intelligence to learn Pythagoras’ theorem? it's overkill🤣
Imran to 4o in private: how do i Allahu Akbar boom-boom your data center as AI is haram
The teachers at the chomdu lol (they were never of any use anyway)
SOHCAHTOA
what a time to be alive
"Soon, you'll have to subscribe for teacher. Premium plan offers better premium teacher!"
The GPT is high on pot nose.
this is the future
is the voice ACTUALLY ai???
Holy crap! that is insane.
This is the most realistic way of communication by an AI until now I find
👍
Great ❤
😮
we're all going to die
Plot twist: they were just on a phone call with a teacher...
Great
Nah at this speed ..syllabus will not be completed.
"Sal is testing technology that will soon replace him, feels cruel."
As an indian student of 11th grade i can surely say that finding sin of an angle in a triangle is the most basic thing we learn in trigonometry in 10th..😂
That’s some serious prompt engineering from the dad. Anyone with kids knows that they won’t recite that.
How did he share the screen to ChatGPT-4o?
Sal Khan is truly one of the greatest men of our time.
THE BREATHING
The great thing is AI will not replace janitors and fast food workers soon. Pick up your brooms and learn to stand in the kitchen for 4 hours straight.
We are actually so cooked
Hey Khan!
But why is the kid not happy
"Just incredible to think we are in the baby stages of AI here. This thing can VERY comfortably tutor for middle school and below maths problems, and it sounds natural, encouraging, and intelligent. Imagine what we will have in 10 years. I think AI is going to take over most of our jobs a lot quicker than anybody is expecting (assuming we are able to shift away from LLM's and into something more sophisticated). AI has been mainly limited a lot by 1) Computation power and 2) Funding. Now that both of those hurdles are far lower than they used to be (thanks to a recent AI boom + NVidia going nuts in the AI market), the developments made in the coming years will be awesome to see"
"Woah, I forgot he was speaking to an AI halfway through the lesson."
0:20 Was it about to complain that it couldn't see anything because of the blurriness?? 😂 This is insane dude!
"I feel a little sad today ... 😟

I was training to be a tutor, so i could make a few bucks finally 😢"
"RIP all teachers, from 5 year olds to 95 year olds"
Why voice assistant is unavailable now?
"Bro, we're witnessing sci-fi in reality... Someone tell me that I'm dreaming 😭"
Please permanently stop the development of all A.I. technology. I beg you🙏🏽.
"What the hell does it say at 1:00? ""Fict, cahs prekt""?"
Really indian teenager who prep for jee study too kuch indepth maths
I wonder why that Kid is learning for a job that's Going to ne obsolete .. go learn how to grow some vegetables kid. They don't know it yet 😂
"Damn, we are at continual inflection points so quickly, it is hard to believe"
Rip teachers
Ultron is coming next
!
"so the new ChatGPT 4os can intervention to the application on every device. Example on video, they are using the iPad so how can I do that, using the ChatGPT to help resolve the math when I'm, open the other application."
"Every kid is going to just ask AI for the answer and learn absolutely nothing. The villains at OpenAI have done it again.

The big dumb is happening"
Wow. This is unreal.
Rip tuition teachers
SAL!
Whyy. Everything will be done by Ai. Why you still need education 😂?!
"she did not like the way he interupeted her that ""tsk"" 😂"
"Years ago, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, had given a talk at a local University and during that talk he had predicted that education as a whole would eventually change from the tradition methods. Well folks, I believe this is what he predicted."
Why I don't have all these video features on my ChatGPT 4o iOS app?
Now that's impressive
"Absolutely brilliant🙏👏 I am a 58 year male and I am going to teach myself math all over again as I flunked out at school. Very embarrassing and disheartening, now I can just be me in my own time.🙏"
"What i actually think we aren't going to use these things to learn but actually to get the job then. Like when everyone would have access to such smart AI why would they try to solve it. They would actually make it do it. 

I think we wont even have to copy these in notebook then. Because most of the work would in our laptop or smartphone"
Interacting with image data in conversational context. This changes everything.
Plot twist: the son and dad are AI
This is insane!
Definitely scripted. No way asian kid doesn't understand the topic right off the bat.
I am going to learn maths again. Finally a worthy tutor.
I'ma tell my kids Sal told his to miss the hypotenuse at first on purpose
"Now THIS is the future! For real. Even if gpt-4o doesn’t become the dominant voice tutor, the fact an AI voice tutor exists means kids will be talking to them for homework assistance…not their parents or paid tutors."
"Wow, just wow, felt like I just watched a magic trick."
how is his son so tapped lol
"That man made me survive my linear algebra class, thanks Khan!"
"Bro that ""Tsk"" in the beginning is wild. She's a savage."
RIp homework
"Welcome to ""HER"""
Gaurav Garg came on Sir's request 😊👏
Him staring hopelessly knowing he gonna lose his job to this ai😂
At first i was crying being an Indian kid for not knowing what are the opposite and adjacent but its just perpendicular and base 😭😭😭😭 (another american thing)
Obviously staged but I think still impressive?
but.. will it blow me?
"In future high school will become obsolete . No human teachers will be required . We are trying so hard to replace our fellow human beings , 😶."
OpenAI doing great job💯👏
Bill Gates has the reason saying that AI will replace the teacher in 2 years
"The best use cases were this and be my eyes, then again, needs to have a test run on all the modules before being deployed to ensure safety. The other use cases have no significant value add."
Wow !
KHAAAAAAANNNN!!!!! 😮
Hello teachers
"Rip mr . khan it was nice knowing you . Yours truly, every dumb noob kids and adults"
"0:24 GPT: Actually in this form I can't-
Well that's worrying.."
I just hope it will help me in solving  physics numericals ...
What a time to be alive!
"We got free tutoring now? This would be a huge help for students, it would be nice if all students like me (especially GCSE students as it is exam season now) can have early access to this technology to help with revision."
Bruh.. his sons face looks like they have been trying for last 10 hours
Gaurav Sir
This has already replaced maths teachers if they introduce it to the school system one job taken down😢
This will replace teachers no doubt
i hope it works the same when it is out of the videos
"Khan, nice to see you!"
dang this is actually so cool and useful
The stuff they did to make it sound emotive makes it sound creepy.
Imagine this in 10 years
I have GPT4o but I don't see those options in the video 😅
I feel ready to face the toughest boss in life: math.
This is impressive
"I would love to see it tackle more difficult problems, like say integration or continuous probability etc"
Sick 🤩
"as we watch in May 2024, this is surely a game changer!
I'm really excited for the future, as this will benefit kids more than we think."
To be honest chat GPT is annoying…always gave me wrong answer..even a simple one! And even when I gave it a correct formula and possible range of answer…it still repeatedly gave me wrong answer while admiting it’s wrong LOL….I wanna make it easy without repeating the question just changing the numbers etc. huhu..and that’s not all…even when asking for simple question like size of A4 paper etc. 💆🏻💆🏻💆🏻💆🏻
This is the most impressive demo of chapGPT 4.0o new model Vision.
Little bro knew the equation for sin of an angle but couldn’t find the hypotenuse… right
I am High on Potenuse
holy..
This is the end of personal tutors
Amazing work OAI
Awesome!  This feature need to upgrade to Plus? It is real time interaction on a split screen with drawing capabilities. It this require specific software or application support beyond the typical capabilities of ChatGPT?  May I know the software on this video they used?  Thank you.
What device does  the guy  use so that he can draw lines ( even in colours ) and AI reads his inputs?
Screen Broadcast? How does that work?
It gives the answers so you can use deduction to find the rest of the problems. This would not work form me.
Just imagine the language models in the next 5 years... Holy moly
IF only there was some way to convey information clearly and easily online and explain math without needing a robot that causes drought. I think they used some archaic technique called reading in the old days? SOH CAH TOA. There now you know trigonometry.
Here from study iq Gaurav sir
Can it also solve PDEs and help me with boundary value problems?
"I asked Chat GPT JEE advance maths problems, it answered only one question correctly😂😂"
Is this RIP to tutors?
What app is that ?
Khan so cool
"First problem , how to fix a monobrow"
this is absolutely awesome in every which way!!
"We Need a Comprehensive Gender Course and Tutoring form this AI

Math Can Wait"
the voice glitching is SO creepy. literally ex machina now
how long would a session that long with gpt 4o cost?
"""I wish I was high on potnuse"""
I think i like the first time ai  before  Gtp 4o i was little bit not good at math now i am  impressed really 😮😮😮
How did they do this setup?  I know how to put it on a split screen but when I do Chat says it can NOT see the other screen that is open?
Bro... How???? Someone tell me how? We just got introduced to a.i properly less than 10 years ago.
Gaurav sir sent
I feel like they've just given us a preview of Apple's collaboration with Open AI here...
Khan was born into a Bengali Muslim family.
IT’S SO CUTE
Which app are they using? Is it the default one on the Google and Apple stores?
Smells fishier than the Devin AI showcase
"So the kid knows the definition of sin(), but didn’t know the definition of hypotenuse, brilliant!"
Gen Z parents... I'm scared for the future.
What are the odds that this replaces tutors?
Hopefully it will comprehend university math
Still It can't solve a single question of JEE Advanced 😂❤
Finally I might get better at math
🤓
Good luck trying to do this for University math/math related degrees 😂😂😂
