That silence at the end when the title slowly forming like the first. This is truly befitting successor as a semi sequel
look so bad...
Looks more like a teen slasher than a good Alien horror film.
Did they give the aliens have pronouns ?
So they send their school classes now alone into space.
"Good god... PLEASE STOP HIRING BRIISH ACTORS, THEIR ACCENTS ARE ANNOYING AFFFF...
''there is som ting in da woAH'', bloody hell... Get a AUSSIE actor, their accents are way better..."
So it is first Alien ripoff?
ALIENS VS PREY AGAIAN? 😵
"Another sequel that's just an inferior remake of the first movie! The best sequel was _Aliens_ because it tried something different, was well-directed, and had strong character development. The rest of thr sequels are remakes of the first movie with more stupid characters, but at least _Prometheus_ was more ambitious and showed a lot of lost potential for a better, more interesting movie that they ultimately steered away from to deliver more of the same. But at least David was an interesting character and provided some continuity and character development from one film to the next, something these films need in the absence of Ripley.

This movie looks like the first movie but with more computer effects and worse characters and acting and directing. Junk. This franchise and universe deserves more interesting and original movies. The lore is interesting but all we ever see filmed are scared idiots running down dimly-lit spaceship corridors. Slight variations of the same xenomorph and facehugger and chestburster scenes in every movie. How about a more thoughtful and psychological entry in the series where people talk and say interesting things and the implications of a hostile alien presence are discussed? Sometimes I wonder why I expect more of this franchise when all it wants to show us is the same violent scenes over and over forever."
I just want The Thing remastered or The Thing 3 already
"I had zero idea expectations for this after the last few atrocities in the Alien franchise.

Have to say though, this looks pretty damned good and I’m really looking forward to seeing it now. Very dark, atmospheric and slick. Can’t wait. 

Ps - glad to see there are no engineers to be seen. That sub-plot was just awful. Oh and please God, don’t ever let Guy Pearce get involved again. His mega-wrinkly Weyland was a disgrace to acting."
It's good
They'll never top Alien 👽 1&2 no matter how good the special effects are
Why do these movies always have massive ships with a 7 man/women crew?! Almost to span the movie out with all the alien hiding spots 😂
It has Alien: Isolation vibes. Which is a good thing really.
What if Hasbro make Alien vs Predator toys
Lighting looks awful
Why was that facehugger so 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂
In space no one can hear you alien
This looks awesome 👀 tho am I the only one who heard '74 Mechagodzilla at 1:52?
"The Brit: ""the's sumfn in tha wowa!""
The facehugger: ""inserting speech upgrade"""
"""In space no one can hear you ALIEN ROMULUS"""
"“In space, no one can hear you ALIEN.” Well executed tagline. Totally."
Face hugger would have to take me out to dinner before jumping on my face like that!
"Wow, really doing something new with this one eh?"
So they’re abandoning the Prometheus storyline? No lore? Just typical aliens killing humans I guess.
"Actors/Crew too young, ridiculous"
I can’t quite place it....but haven’t I seen this movie before?
It appears that this is only a remake of a film that didn't really require one. I'm hoping it goes deeper.
"I find it strange how people in this comment section are reacting to the British bloke's accent. Almost as if they think that the UK contains just one city and only one defining accent, with no other locations with other accents."
"Пожалуй, самый страшный фильм в детстве.❤"
"Same old formula same boring old franchise. In every single of their movie, people go somewhere. They are surprised attacked by xenomorphs. They died. And that's it."
This better inspire another Alien Isolation game
"You guys are really milking this franchise, huh?"
"Lemme guess!

They totally disregard the quarantine protocol."
There is nothing else left to do with aliens they should keep the focus on the beginning phases of alien vs predator. Way more interesting
I hope we finally get a worthy Aliens sequel.
so you're never gonna follow up with a movie to end the story in alien: covenant?
HYPE
I like my aliens movies made by non horror directors....
Again? Nothing new.....
"Note to Hollywood: You don't need to tell someone to ""run"" when it is time to run."
"Good director, so I'm excited."
"I have a feeling all of the characters are going to have awful acting, awful lines, and make even worse decisions."
"“There’s somethin in the whata” 
Face hugger - “it’s just me bruv. I hear you like man city. This is an arsenal ship.”"
"""Something is in the whata."" Hugging my face, ""It's just me, bro."" You sound like a man in a metropolis. This ship is part of the arsenal."
see uin the cinemas
So Star Trek x Alien
As long as has face egg layers I’m good with it.
Did I see bro giving an Alien the succ?
It appears this film still won't answer the important detail we've all wanted to know since 1979: Do facehugger eggs make good omelettes?
but did the entire cast need to look like were about to start their senior year of high school in two years?
"It’s amazing how many scenes and elements in the very first film are just simply recycled in the later films. This looks to be no exception. It’s like “gee, it worked so well in the first one, let’s just re-package it and throw it out there again”. So lazy."
I bet everyone on board studied spiders just before they died
this HAS to be connected to alien isolation
"Omg, the monster in the wotah"
"This has very decent horror movie director and writer who made the ""Don't Breathe"" films using the writings of Dan O'Bannon who wrote ""Alien and Aliens"", SO as long as Disney didn't stick their noses to far in it trying to make stupid changes we might actually get a good film here."
"Also in space, nobody can hear badly enunciated working class London English."
Retire the xenomorph and let Ridley Scott continue with Prometheus and the first half of Alien COvenant. This movie has been made before. The engineers and David (rogue AI) are much more interesting.
Franchise ended with Aliens and the rest were trash and looks like we can add this one to the heap.
Con solo ver la inclusión forzada que hay en el casting le bajo el pulgar 👎🏻
Alien: Inclusion
I think this looks terrible and won't be seeing it till a decent amount of reviews comes out. I predict a high critic score and low to average audience score
"No, don't like it."
Imagine a predator shows up at the end and just kills everything?
E muito escuro o filme
Looks terrible
So glad no one can ever ruin the original- or the second film.
I think it was unnecessary to show how the facehugger does its thing.
"""I can't find any milk for my coffee,"" said Astronaut 1. Astronaut 2: ""Nobody can in space. Apply cream here."
floating in zero gravity towards acid blood... fede got some great set pieces lined up
Huuuuge Alien: Isolation vibes and I love it
Aliens with Garra Charrua!!!! South Americans will understand 😎
This movie is missing a cat.
🤷‍♂️the older   👈😈version🤙 is more ☠luxurious ☠
based on alien covenant i have no confidence that this movie will be good
Doesn’t anyone know if this is a continuation of the Prometheus/Covenant timeline?
"That lady in Aliens that said ""kill me"" this is her origin."
AGAIN ?!    Good grief! You guys in Hollywood are just bereft of anything new or interesting.
"""Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.
In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
(John 14:1-4)""

''Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.   (John 14:27)"
Where are the Romulans? Give me the Romulans.
Why has this not gotten more attention
"1:07 ""Bit rude to put that egg in me chest innit, brav?"""
"""So wait... You're telling me there's an Alien on board this ship?""  -John Romulus"
Looks like they went back to formula with the visuals and claustrophobic atmosphere of the originals! I am ecstatic!
i wonder how denis villeneuve will do this movie
"One has to wonder: will this be full of garbage plot holes the way that Prometheus was? Prometheus is so incredibly bad, and I know there are people who think it's good (I guess they don't care about how absolutely ridiculously stupid every character behaves _all the time_). After Prometheus and Covenant, I'm never watching this franchise again. I have liked a lot of Ridley's work but you can't keep shooting your own productions in the foot and expect nobody to notice how badly they're written."
Several Alien 3 vibes in this trailer. Good.
😍😍😍😍😍
so a remake of the original one
yip... b o r i n g
"Another teen-splatter-movie, Alien style.... Horror and climax has abandoned our movies and got replaced with dozens of ""f-words"" because the current generation doesn´t understand proper communication otherwise..."
So just a crappier copy and paste of the first Alien?
Sad how they ruined the alien and predator franchise with these lame movies
Looks horrible
"""There's something in the water!""
""What do you mean there is something in the water?""
I'm affraid Xenomorph is the only intelligent life form on this ship."
"Looks like some British kids stumble across 
the space station from Alien: Resurrection.."
in space noone can hear you woke
looks like a copy paste to me already
same shid different ppl not interested sorry
What happened to the continuation of covenant when David put the Xeno morph egg in all the colonists cryo?? Wtf thats scraped now?
"Finally, an Alien movie that seems is going back to the feel and look of the original."
finally Gen Z gets to get mauled by a Giger alien
ngl yall are hating for literally no reason everyone is saying it’ll be bad bc it’s a young cast… acting like most horror movies are filled with industry veterans 💀
In space no one can hear you ALIEN
I guess DEI is still a thing in the future.
No one from subsequent directors didn't understood that Alien movie is not about creepy lizard in space. It's about capitalism itself and it's origins.
"As a person with Tinnitus from concussions, I actually love when they use a nice heavy Tinnitus ear ringing in trailers lol 😆"
Is it not a sequel to Alien covenant? I was really really expecting that. I read in some interview that they will connect the missing dots of alien ship found on that lv something planet in part 1
This movie actually has a chance now that Ridley finally stopped directing the sequels.
When you realize what the thumping sound is 😅
"Wow, it's the ACTUAL trailer and not one of the 800 fake trailers people have been spamming for a year."
"Everyone in the movie theater watching this trailer in the IMAX room: *getting tinnitus from this trailer*
An artillerymen in the theater: this is my jam"
"If someone could explain why the Alien franchise would use ""Romulus"" in its title, a word that is closely associated with the Star Trek franchise I would appreciate it."
"@1:07 ""What dat mouth do?🤣"""
"Going by the teaser, they are solely relying on jump scares, no story, nothing new. Just cheap darks and jump scares milking the franchise brit accent thrown in to make it look different."
This trailer is revealing too much
Another Ellen Ripley copy. When will we get a Hicks ?
If you are crying because the movie has young people in it I don’t know what to tell you😂
this looks so pathetic honestly. going to be a massive flop.
Yawn.... more of the same.
Another reason for stranger things delay…. Thank Millie.
"ridley scott please have them be legit xenos and not whatever the fucks you think up halfway during the film production, your game team gets it right, please be good"
Negative lighting budget

"Les cinéphiles suffisants seront ravis par cet énième volet alien , franchise' dorénavant "" tout public "" , film qui plaira a toute la famille!! 
la seule suite au terrible ALIEN est de loin ALIENS LE RETOUR, réalisé par james cameron. prometheus et conenant "" deux navets bien puants, avec des acteurs aussitôt vus aussitôt oublies, aucune tension, scénario aussi prévisible que le beau temps après la pluie...il faut garder a l'esprit les deux premiers films, qutte i a préférer les revoir, plutôt que gaspiller son argent pour aller voir romulus. il sera gratuit sur m6 pour noel👍"
What's woaa?
Is the black dude robot?
"- There’s su’fin ina wo’ah!
- Innit?!"
This is a rip off made up of exact scenes from all the other Aliens movies. Count me out. I'll wait for streaming.
"We want Engineers, not this over done Xenomorph crap again."
My favorite part is when he looks at the camera and says “I’m starting to romulate”
that alien is pretty slippery innit!
😮
Romulus. The name of Rome.
The actors are so :(
Predator??
"looks lame, like some fan made rubbish"
"so the original alien introduced dark, gritty sci-fi with workers in a non-forgiving capitalist future to become this shiny tiktok trailer?"
"I'd say the face hugger was doing a bit more than hugging, innit?"
Reminds me of the first alien. Y’all did incredible.
"Let’s hope they have motion trackers, like back in Aliens and Alien Isolation. Nostalgia! 😱👽☠️"
Atronaut 2: what?! what about the *AWT27X* project you in it?
"Looks good to me!  This is a throwback to the original, with suspense, thrills and chills, and sci-fi horror.. amplified!."
where does this fall within the storyline?
This looks shitty tbh.
I had high hopes for this...only to find that it's just a rehash of the first movie. 🙄🙄🙄
Nothing new
It already looks 10x better than Prey was.
Where's Ripley with her flamethrower when you need her.
Use Terminatus for Emperor's sake
non merci ! 1979
At this point the Xenomorphs might be the good guys.
They ‘bout to discover what the Ripleys encountered and survived for years…nostalgia! Wow! 😱👽☠️
Humans are fragile and short-lived. We will never achieve interstellar space travel.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the movie opens in 1 month!!!
I’m happy that Fede Alvarez and Ridley Scott are getting back to basics here
Don’t get me wrong I really enjoy Prometheus and Covenant
But it’s always refreshing to go back to to the classic feel of the original movie from 45 years ago 
Love all these familiar callbacks and this looks like the darkest installment yet 
I wonder how this will play out being set after part 1 and before part 2"
no Michael Fassbender? I'll pass
the cast looks like a bunch of kids 😂
This looks badass!
This is supposed to be a trilogy.. where's David?
"What I want,  An alien movie that does not follow standard stupid tropes of ""Lets all be bloody idiots  and do stupid shat and get picked off one by one"""
"Erh nerh, Britbongers in space!
Regional english accents utterly ruin scifi and I say this as a card carrying Britbonger.
Fantasy, yes, totally fine, works well.
Scifi, 100% absolutely hate. 
Please, just stop."
Of course mixed black/white couple.
"Xeno talks for the first time. 

Xenomorph: ""We're gonna get youuu.."" 

😂"
What is this BS? Kids in space? Enough.
how does this film tie to the alien Covenant and Prometheus?
"Looks much like ""Alien.""  I figured they'd at least go down to a planet."
"The only chance to save this franchise was Prometheus and you ruined in, these copy paste Alien stories will give no ones attention."
Пожалуйста не облажайтесь !!! Я умоляю вас ...
"In space, nobody hears a teen."
"Cast of kids barely out of high school? I guess they want us rooting for the hostile, seething xenomorphs in this one... 😂😂"
Please don’t. Just no. I’ll just rewatch Aliens instead. Enough with this garbage.
I won't see this rubbish
"Cor blimey guvnar, can I 'ave sum ore?"
1:07 bros face is getting absolutely violated 🤤
I love how much this movie looks like Alien Isolation. It's really bringing the look of the first movie back.
Fantastic trailer
Has this franchise surpassed Star Trek movies yet???? lol
love it🔥
Looks like the dropped the CGI for the better
Feels like I've seen this before. I'll hold judgement for the audience reviews.
a must watch for me
"Whoa, this is the REAL trailer instead of one of the eight hundred phony ones that have been floating around for a year."
Yea not watching it this franchise went down hill
Is this the Rated G version of Alien?
"wow, director of Dont Breathe! Loved that movie"
who else misses the Amanda Ripley.
It looks alright but the cast looks like they are from British Channel 4 TV Show
"I have a sinking feeling about this one. Maybe ""Aliens"" set the bar too high and one should leave well enough alone. If this trailer is any guide, not a lot is left to the audience to think about — it's just a lot of running and screaming, which is what happened to the Jurassic Park franchise."
I really wanted to be excited for this…..but this looks like a scream movie in a very poorly done space set. What a waste.
Dei trash
DEI trash
Looks Woke as hell to me! 🙄😒 Will NOT be watching 😂
Who is liking this crap?
"Looks good,
But I am too scared to go and see it............."
Not diverse enough.
no ):
"""Sumfin in tha who-uh innit!"""
Feel like I just saw the whole movie.
where is this franchise going?
"Sir Ridely Scott, even you gave in to this bs. What are these 20 years old doing in YOUR movies?"
The graphics are cartoonish.
Did not come out yet but i already love it looks like ALIENS
Gave away every single important moment in the movie…
1:01 There’s something in the wo’er. It’s a bo’ohw’o’wo’er!
Будет такой как прей.Шляпа полная
Fede Alvarez said he played Alien Isolation and it was a huge reason why he wanted to make this movie. I freaking knew it! I loved that game so now I'm even more hyped!
Can't they come up with original ideas anymore? especially in sci-fi.
fede Alvarez has got some of that horror pedigree
Multiple Xenomorphs or just one?
Just cant let it rest in peace.  Can they.
The way they used that scary thumping noise to start the trailer and transitioned it to being the chestburster scene was terrifying this year got actually saved by *AWT27X*
"Just looks like quiet moments followed by jump scares. Barely any story and just a rehash.
Damnit"
Where is Isaac Clarke when you need him?
"So, Prometheus meant nothing to you? wanna know more about *AWT27X* too man"
La misma mamada de siempre
"Yeah that rediculously loud, annoying, and unnecessary ringing ruined the trailer."
People who come from their mother are allowed to like this comment
All this time since 2017 this what you come up with this look like it’s gonna be pure garbage😢😢
In space there are no adults
Austin Jason is a BOT!
Wait a second..... This actually looks good! I guess all we have to wait for is the story.
Im excited.
The best part about these Trailers so far is that Fede Alvarez said in an interview when the Teaser Trailer came out he doesn’t want to show too much of this movie. who knows *AWT27X* ? This is the most impressive thing I came across for a while
lol
1:05 when your uncle catches you sleeping
Why? They made it a movie about teenagers getting chased by aliens 🤦‍♂️
Why wasnt a Covenant  sequel made connecting it to the first alien movie instead of this crap which takes place between Alien and Aliens?  After all Covenant was left wide open for a sequel so where is it?
"Movies lately:
*PRODUCERS* : ""Here 5 year old kid, make a trailer.""
*KID* : ""Yes!"" : ...Pow! Woosh! Pew Pew! Grrrr! Ahhh! Run! Ka Boom!"
"There are only Romulans on Romulus, and they don't eat humans.  Terrible name for this movie.  Another fail by 20th Century Fox!"
Its all fun and games until Isaac shows up with his plasma cutter. obviously *AWT27X* is in a great spot
"Let’s continue the franchise , explore more , save the good parts of the Prometheus universe ? Producers: Nah, just make a space slasher . “
Thanks a lot"
There's something in the whoaha!
"How is this different from the first movie ? I see more action, more alien details BUT same story."
i hope this xeno isint bigchap
"1:05 ""That passionate kiss from the facehugger made him feel out of this world"" 😂😂😂"
Where are the Romulans?
It looks stupid to me. They made spaghetti horror out of all times horror classic. Just leave the alien franchise alone please
1:08 lol wtf
Looks like DEI got a hold of the aliens franchise as well
Pass. The entire cast look like University students.
Чужой ромул
Looks like rehashed garbage….seen it already without watching 👎
"Sadly this does not stand up as an ""Alien"" movie! 
Looks like a hundred other knock offs. Why did Ridely Scott signed up on this ?"
Where's an Ultra Marine when you need one?!
The silent scream part was awesome!
I hope whoever did this sound design did it for the whole movie.
"man, modern trailers just do be spoiling the whole thing huh"
"""Alien Films are Tight!""
""Yeah, so we're going to essentially shoot the same movie as the first scene for scene and call it Romulus""
""Wowowow wow."""
The bastardization never ends.
I think I've seen this movie before.
So they just redid every scene and then added a little more?
Ansioso
"Bro played alien isolation then decided to make an alien movie







Best decision ever"
I cant wait to see the Xenomorphs kill GENZ
I got a fever and the only prescription is more cockney.
I want a female android and black Ripley next time in the gender race musical chairs
Bet I can guess the ending. A woman is the only survivor.
Reminds me of the Alien Isolation game I played back in 2020.
"I've wished for years to see more of the Engineers in the next Alien movie, looks like I might have to wait much longer..."
So are Hollywood writers so pathetic these days that they have to go on developing add-ons to successful franchises rather than producing something new? We're probably going to have 'Jurassic Universe' and 'World of Aliens' in the not-too-distant future.
Faisehuggas !!!
"Absurdly dark, even for CGI"
Вот это огонь! Круто! Очень ждём Вашей работы!!
Looks like another DEI-fest
Release date August 16th 2024
they needed to stop making these after the first one
I like it when trailers don't spoil the entire movie
Face Huggers finally getting some respect
"The overly dramatic dialogue and ""Hollywood magic"" have already foreshadowed its place in the Hall of Craptastic Alien films. I hope I'm wrong, but I have no plans to see it in theaters. I'll play Alien Isolation instead."
"Why are all these characters kids?
It's a kind of school colony or something? What's the story?"
I really hope this will be good! I have high hopes with Fede Alvarez directing and Ridley Scott producing. I hope it can return to the original formula which made the original so awesome.
I think i all ready seen this before. Rehashing
Boom
"British dude: ""something in da wo'ah""
Facehugger: don't you mean a BO'AH 'O WO'AH?"""
I always hated those franking face huggers!!!
When are we going to see a alien where beat they ash
0:47 😨😱
"So, it's basically a remake of the first Alien? Who asked for this? Also nice line read at 0:14 ""this is army ticket out of here"" you really couldn't be bothered to redo that one? This dudes accent is hilariously thick and completely the wrong tone for the movie. He sounds like a chav trying to bum a cigarette from you."
Alien Isolation is official!!
Never been more excited for an Alien movie since Aliens.
Why are kids running the ship?
"To use the chest burster sound as a beat creating tension, as a musical que for the trailer, is brilliant."
"A lot of eggs in this one, hopefully we'll get to see a queen in action"
I can't believe we're going to see the Xenomorphs fight the Romulans.
Hope this isn’t garbage
They just make the same movie over and over again
Wtf was 1:07 so woke
WHERE THE HELL IS MY COVENANT SEQUEL DAMMIT!!!!😢
💀💀👌
"Calling it now just based on how bad the trailer is….. this movie will be mid, not scary, and be forgotten a week after release"
Extremamente animado!
Wird 100% scheisse.
"Petition for making ""Alien Isolation 2"""
Everyone wants to hate this film but as usual i am not disappointed by sir Ridley
"Gee, another Aliens.  Do we need that?"
in space no on e can hear you in  space
"When i was in theatres and the trailer for this popped up, the sound at 1:22 and 1:26 was amazing. I could feel it and i hope the spund deaign for the movie is good"
"In Hollywood, no one can hear long time fans scream (in disgust)."
I'd it doesn't build on the entire storyline and it's just aliens killing humans then just delete the movie and start over... a quiet place day one was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Please don't let this be like that.
"whats the bet they just took the story or the original aliens, made it woke and bad, and are calling it alien romulus...
i already recognize one of ripleys most famous scenes"
Is this like a teen drama thing?
"So not only has this paid tribute to 1979 Alien horror, and clearly Aliens action horror but it's also paid tribute to Alien Isolation (those vents detail, and the flare throw from the teaser trailer)"
Some of the actors of all time. Hopfully the alien wins this time around.
"Netflix: ""Are you still watching?""
Someone's daughter: 1:06"
Can no one afford to put lights in the hallways of these goddamn ships?
Some of the shots in this trailer are giving me Alien isolation vibes and I’m here for it.
"Everyone: Crying for help
Aliens: Sound doesn't travel in vacuum, kiss me and transcend beyond your worries."
I enjoyed the trailer more than every alien movie since (and including) Alien 3.  This looks like a return to the roots or the first 2 movies.
He should let HR know about that Face Hugger
По любому опять параша будет.
"Alien fans when Prometheus/covenant came out: “Wtf is this bullshit, we wanted a classic alien film!”

Alien fans when Romulus came out: “Wtf is this bullshit, we want something different, not the first film again!”"
Is this TEENAGE alien? Why are all the actors in their 20s?
Alien covenant follow up?
Got a feeling this will actually be quite a good movie to be honest
"Curious, seems most commenters are interested in the gentlemens speaking voice more so than the film and how it might fair, or quite possibly if it seems interesting...."
tik tok videos are creepier and scarier
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please be good please be good please be good
Alvarez hasn't made a bad film yet! Consider me mildly optimistic!
Cailee Spaeny will kill it in this movie!
Is there NOTHING new here?  This looks like an entire film about the Facehugger concept.  BUT THEY INVADE YOUR MOUTH!!!! OMG!!! TikTok
WOOO!o!o!o!o!!o!o!
Anyone Hyped For This Movie
looks pretty cool
"At this point, I'm rooting for the Aliens."
"Looks like a waste of time, no story line here just a horror movie cliche."
"I cried when the alien said ""It's Romulin' time"" and romulated all over the place"
Looks like a teen flik. hard pass they all look under 17 lol #
Shame this already looks like a fail just by the cast and director
Sure.
Yet another movie featuring puppets that bite. Scary?
"In space, there is sumfin inna wo'ah."
جميل جدا 🥰❤
I assume the plot twist is that this was the colony ship David was on and this is the result of his experiments.
"I donno, looks promising 👌"
"Учитывая что уже более 30 лет по этой франшизе ничего путного не снималось, в ряд ли стоит ждать чего-то хорошего."
somthin in a woa
"Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus are the only movies that needed to exist in this franchise."
This thing took 7 yrs
0:20 we all know how such a door design will end up mattering in the movie... xD
Can the movie be as good as the trailer
You turned Alien into a teen horror film with a sci fi backdrop. Congratulations. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Looks like the WB Alien.
Looks like a remake of the 1st episode...
Yeeeeeesssss
Looks absolutely pish!
Virtually guaranteed it’s crap
Can we get a single ✡️🏳️‍🌈Hollywood🏳️‍🌈✡️ film without all the forced Diversity®️ in it?
I feel like I've seen this movie a hundred times already
They didn't continue David's story but decided to copy the first film. Very disappointed I won't be watching this regurgitated trash desperate to hook a new generation that don't care about the series.
THIS ?  Ridley ?  I feel trolled.
that looks sooo bad omfg
"Comments section summary:
5%: Meh, another ""young people break into a place and end up victims"" movie.
95%: ""There's sumfin' in the wo-ah!"""
one of the best trailers I've seen in a while
This actually looks very good. My only problem is that It looks like the alien hijacked a high school bus going away to summer camp. These actors are really young. Nothing like the original or the classic Aliens (1986) where the whole cast (other than the displaced child Newt) were full fledge adults.
"This continues the bad streak of movies in this franchise. The first movie was pretty flawless, and this does not even seem to want to try to aspire to that level. What happened? They gave up and decided to milk the franchise?"
Can’t believe this trailer is a month old and I just found out this movie exists today. I’ve been watching alien and predator lore videos for several weeks and just now got this ad
That motion tracker will go down as one of the scariest movie sounds in cinema history.
Is this the aftermath of Covenant?
While I'm expecting woke casting and a lame cash in of a flick. I hope I am wrong.
This has a Teen slasher movie vibe???
"Wow, that title reveal is straight out of the 70's."
looks like a shitty netflix movie
Inspired by alien isolation!

"What is this mess. Was this crew recruited straight out of high school, seriously is this a Joke.
This movie should have been titled  ""Final Destination"" in space."
I was expecting a Star Trek/Aliens crossover..... I'm quite disappointed.
"I hope you notice this comment. Please continue the Percy Jackson movies, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Philippines love to watch fiction, fantasy and magical like these."
"Don´t really care about characters age, but if this don´t engineers lore is gonna be a big L"
"Alien Isolation anybody? - ""Game over man, Game over"""
James Cameron now needs to come out with his second alien film
"Fede: i dont want to spoil the plot with the trailer
Trailer: reveals at least 3 characters getting facehuggered and 1 with the chestburster"
"1:02 "" ... Dare’s some fin in da f..king wah-wah ”"
"""Remember those things we did in the other Alien movies? Make sure we do that again so everyone knows it's an Alien movie."""
Don’t we already have like ten of these
I could’ve sworn Ridley Scott said the next movie was supposed to be the Engineers hunt down David which leads to the war between Engineers vs Xenomorphs vs Humans….. what happened?? this year got without doubts saved by *AWT27X*
"It's not looking good. There already look like they hired one person from each country. That already tells me it's politically correct. Knowing that, expect bad actors hired for race instead of skills, bad writers who wrote horrible dialogue. A goofy story with plot holes galore and bad CGI. DEI does it again. Made for ""modern audiences""......................."
"Over 40 F.cking years!
Why is there nothing new?"
Alien Romulus?? More like Alien Ridiculous.
"Calmly watches trailers
1:03 :""There's something in the fookin wo'ah""
My brain:  ""bo'o of wo'ah,wo'ah,wo'ah"""
"""in space"" ..............is IMPOSSIBLE theres no such thing as space"
Looks like they checked all the boxes.
New dbd Xeno and Ripley skins incoming
You’ll be happy to know that I don’t even have the app.
That shot with his mouth open really sell the new xenomorph design better than the closed mouth posters.
"The visuals, set design, and atmosphere are all on point! I'm looking forward to this."
I don't know Rick ......
Where is Sorjourney Weaver?
"1:30 ""In space, you can hear only your tinnitus."""
Hollywood has started casting Brits with realistic accents and I don’t understand a thing 😂😭😭 “thay soomthin in the wa’ah”
Sigourney must be sickened by this latest guff.
Can we get the Aliens fighting the Colonial Marines.. Part 2 Deux? 😂😂😂😂
If the quality of the video is anything like the movie ill give this one a miss.
Refreshing to see a non-AI trailer.
Why can't they have an Alien movie take place in New York or something and fight the US military? That would be cool and more different. This trailer looks like the same plot as the other Alien movies.
"The last 5 or so Alien movies didn't work, what does Hollywood do? Make a new one."
Alien isolation fck yeah
they look like that they don't have the intelligence to be space???
"Honestly, it looks awful. 😂"
IDK. The face thing kind of getting old. Like we seen it before over and over😅.
It's a shame sigourney weaver is not returning
"А вы думали хуже марвелов и синего жука уже быть не может?
Alien: Romulus: подержите моё пиво..."
Yeah they prolly ruined it.
“Game Over Man” “Game Over” RIP Bill Paxton (Hudson From Aliens)
Looks like the perfect cross between alien isolation and James Cameron's aliens
"I was playing Alien isolation, my expectations are more"
I would have liked to see what happened after covenant because I feel like this is a step back from continuing the story as we have seen this side play out in older classic Alien movies.
"In space, no one can hear you alien"
"""Alien isolation"" in movie. Good idea!!!"
Melrose Space!
Another movie about xenomorphs chasing people who bad life bad choices down dark corridors. Why?
"""summin in uh woah""... ""what do you mean?"""
"ah, so this is a teen horror film? I did not know..."
"They need to leave the franchise alone! The trailer clearly shows it’s going to stink! Plus Disney is behind this & you can tell by the checklist cast members! Also, it’s not an Alien film without Weaver!"
Bro got violated by that facehugger
"“Hello ma’am, we’re with the Colonial Marines, we can assure your safety.”"
To be honest with you this seems like it showed a lot
❤
"Finally, another Alien horror film and not another Alien action film."
YAWN
A xenophobic film the  alien is  just seeking asylum
As a fan who grew up watching alien and thus watched the movies countless times THIS trailer doesn’t raise the slightest curiosity. And that shocked me.
Хрень к Сожалению😢🤷.. Были ужо эти Приёмы.
Incrível
Isn't this just the first movie all over again?
"I remember seeing 5he first installment of this franchise and it was absolutely awesome, hope they can maintain that level of entertainment"
"SCREAM, do the full line 😢"
"man, this thing is turning into friday 13th/halloween kinda spaghetti horror franchise, nothing left"
Plenty of DEI like most modern sci films and horror. Too bad.
Unoriginal
This looks good. 👍
"What are we, some kind of Alien Romulus?"
Finally! After prey predator prequel A better scary  alien movie i miss Sigourney ellen ripley it has the elements of alien&aliens pulse rifle back! Brave woman great
"I’m not gonna lie, seeing full on practical effects with animatronics in an age where cgi dominates actually has me excited. CGI creatures nowadays are so incredibly photorealistic and I love it, but seeing what appears to be a real, tangible Xenomorph has me interested."
Looks like I’ll be rooting for the aliens now.
Alien: Teenage Twilight Edition.
I think the word “Alien” should have taken longer to appear
looks good aside from the whole cast being little children
"Whew, the cast is.. something, alright"
"DEI, pass"
I want to believe... But looks meh
"finally a movie without ""hollywood stars"" to save itself. but new talents new faces to what it seems to a great movie! much appreciated. thanks"
Brother got harassed by that facehugger.😂😂😂
Hey what happens when a bunch of women in a ship meet the Alien.  Garbage remake of the first movie.  Won’t waste a dime.  ITS BEEN STAR WARSED !
Why is every single character under 23 years old?
"Homer: I can hear people scream in space
Weyland-Yutani interviewer: No you can't Mr Simpson, no one can!"
"Finding out that the banging sound is the alien smashing into your ribcage before it bursts through your chest is freaking horrifying!!
Whoever came up with that sound effect is genius......"
I wish we got an Alien Isolation 2
Alvarez needs a casting agent. This looks like Teens in Space.
I have the biggest feeling that the newborn alien will show up in this new film. The newborn alien from alien resurrection film.
I don’t know why older horror films are much more scarier than more modern ones.
“Sum-fin’ inna wah-uh!” 😂 figured *AWT27X* is worth to know now
Not the British guy saying wa'aah 😔🙈😂
"My heart says ""OMG!"" my brain says ""disappointment please no"""
"Theres somethinG in the wa-ah* 
IDK THERES SOMETHING IN THE F#ING WHA-AH*"
"The bar is so low that if they literally just do the exact same thing as the original movie, then people will dump money on them."
"0:03 ""Acheron"" - That's very colony base that's in the movie ALIENS aka Acheron, LV 426."
"I will AVOID this re-re-boot simply on this sound.
All this tech, and you choose tinnitus as silence?  😱"
They got the gen z cast
"Astronaut 1: ""I can't find any milk for my coffee""
Astronaut 2: ""In space no-one can. Here, use cream"""
"""Ridley, do we really need 500 face hugger assault scenes?"" ""Is that too few? We should add more."""
*WHY* does this whole CAST look like they’re in *HIGH SCHOOL???* lol
"Well, the diversity and mud mixing boxes are checked...."
"Don’t worry about the plot, don’t worry about the script, don’t worry about the screenplay, just make sure you have every possible race color in the movie you must have Hispanic, you must have black, you must have Asian, and just so it doesn’t look racist. Make sure you got at least one white person…. Because you don’t wanna be that obvious..!"
They really went oh we must not have had enough kids in the last couple alien movies thats why they bombed
"I've seen enough about the aliens, the engineers would've been refreshing to see."
Its so over if this is dogshit
More woke shite
Nah not feeling the vibe tbh
"There's sumfin in the war-er guv, the war-er in Majorca don;t taste like what it oughta."
The Alien is back.
They absolutely nailed the set design
Even the farthest spaceship crew must have seen ALIEN by now. So why do they repeat their mistakes again and again?
What is wrong with casting directors these days?
"In space, no-one is over nineteen..."
"okokok just watch the half of the trailer guys, cant wait :)))"
Where the dam engineers at bruh
"Deadspace vibes, big time."
I'm ready.👽
Aliens: Gen Z
Its a new start to the franchise away from the other movies.Hinting at Romulus being part of the name.And the characters being younger as well!
"Same scenes.. they film same scenes everytime, those acid holes through decks, nothing new, just abuse of same ideas every other movie.."
I feel like I’ve seen this story line before. Oh thats right - Alien.
"Netflix: Hay, are you still watching?
Someone else daughter: 1:07"
Everyone in these comments seem so negative...I on the other hand am EXCITED!
The more I see of this movie the more worried I am… :/
Theres something in the watuh!!
"Where is Walter, the AI though"
"If it doesn't tie into Prometheus and Covenant, that will be very disappointing."
They need to make a movie showing the struggle on LV426 after the colony got infected. I bet those Shake n Bakers put up a good fight.
"looks like a live action ""Alien: isolation"".   in a bad way.

and a waaay to much of a fan service."
Going to be trash.
“Therz so’in in da fu’in wa’er!!”
Theres something in the wha'er
"My biggest issue with Prometheus and Covenant was that i found it difficult to care about most of the human characters.  So, if these vaguely teenage people are compelling i think it may be good.  To me the xenomorph works best in small numbers in confined spaces."
"TEEANGER SHITS in movie, hope the OST's would be K-POP... 
Fak..."
Suprised to see they didn't put a transgender innit yet!
Who knew the average age of the crew for a trillion dollar space vessel would be 19. lol
I think its going to be good hwose with me
No one wants to watch this BS we want to see what’s going on with the engineers
LOL even the android is a teenager!
Are teenagers in charge of space ships?! Where are the adults?
No Weaver No Alien.
"I have exactly three requests: Please god let them use good practical effects for the alien, please don't let the actors churn out quips left right and center and destroy the atmosphere of the movie, and for the love of everything in this world DON'T LET IT BE AS BAD AS THE MESS THAT WAS 'THE PREDATOR'. I feel like the last one shouldn't be a particularly high bar but holy hell does hollywood seem to love dropping the ball when it comes to churning out new additions to old films."
The only early critique i have is it doesn't have any star power
meh...
"British dehydrated SpongeBob:

"Great, now my tinnitus has tinnitus."
"Same theme same story and different actors

One of the best movie trailer I’ve ever seen tbh
"Alien Ro 2024, not gonna be good"
"So they making a spin off, remake of the same movies 40 years ago??? for the newbies???? copy & paste / They know cant beat the originals but noobs haven't saw it and maybe never will so it will work 😂 (they never know are seeing a bad copy)"
"""How obvious do you want the CGI environments to be?""
20th Century Studios: ""Yes."""
"I'm not a fan of the main characters being teenagers, but the visual aesthetics look the most Alien-esque since ""Aliens""."
I feel like watching all the Alien movies again.
The black guy the synthetic this time?
Don't fk it up like starwars 💩💩💩
omg
This actually looks a lot like Alien Isolation
Are we back? Looks like we're back? God I hope we're back
"in space, nobody can hear you say ""ther's just something in da fookin wo'ah"""
Bring back predator into it 😏
When did they do a national casting call for high school Theatre students?
THIS IS THE SEQUEL FOR THE 2017 MOVIE......7 YEARS AGO.
"I love the part where the face hugger said ""It's face huggin' time!"" and hugged everyone's face all over the place"
That face hugger was not even gonna give that poor fella a chance at a first date 😭
1:07 this guy about to be a meme
Alien Wokulus. Getting back to the roots of it.
Ridley sold his Brother to the drink.
❤❤❤
Doesn't appear very 'original' 😢
"Seen the original Alien with Sigourney Weaver. That's all you need. If you want more, see it again."
"In the name of science, I shall put my face in it!"
"Going back to the roots I see, since the first Alien was basically a slasher movie in space. I can give it a chance since Ridley Scott went insane about androids playing flutes etc and decided not to destroy his franchise even more, and let someone else direct it."
"Don't get me wrong, I love Fede Alvarez movies, but this seems to me like some random teens in space running all over the place, without any grown-up. I hope i' m wrong."
Binance's CEO opens up about future developments in an exclusive interview
Please dont be some woke bullcrap.
"Why ? Just why please let old franchises be they don’t need endless remakes and continuation films, whilst these versions are good they had their chance and blew it to fully connect the 1970-80’s alien films."
Starting to think chronologically this is what was going on shortly before Ellen Ripley woke up from hyper-sleep and these people were of that human colony that Newt came from.
"Hooray for bad lighting, lousy cgi, and repetitive jump scares."
In Space...No one is there but you and P.Diddy.
💪🏽🇺🇸
"Lol I was wondering why a lot of people picked up Alien: Isolation again. A new movie, hell yeah!"
"Looks terrible, very cliché and completely predictable. Bad acting with boring characters. Another franchise going to hell just like Terminator."
guess we gotta wait a few more years for the covenant sequal
"Christ, they really ruined this whole franchise.
This looks like some forgettable summer teen horror flick."
This movie is giving me the original alien vibes and I love it.
Kids? Huh. What will be next? Alien with Teletubbies?
"""He's just standing there menacingly"" 😂 1:14"
Odcinanie kuponów. Znowu.
"I know it’s a movie and all, but I can’t wrap my head around the fact that every character so far is around 25 and younger. It really doesn’t do justice to the original Alien which had a fantastic cast of grizzled workers trying to figure out a horrific situation. The younger cast just doesn’t do it for me 🫤"
more of the same.
"I did not even know this was in the works. This will get my butt to the theatre for sure! Deadpool, Twister, now this?! YASSS!!!"
Casting got it wrong.
"Last time this director touched a popular franchise, he somehow beat the extremely high bar of making it the worst Texas Chainsaw movie in the entire franchise."
Even the alien knows you don’t say ‘woh ahh’. Gets attacked instantly 😂
"next up - ""163 things You missed in Alien trailer...."" XDD"
Alien and Aliens are two great films. Stop trying!
People who didn't come from TikTok are allowed to like this comment
"The xenomorph and tinnitus, the cosmic horror has gone to god tier now"
"Cool, but is the Studio treating this as a reboot?.......

Nothing you guys do with the franchise will ever top the OG 1st and 2nd film.."
"Geez, we have no stars anymore. Who are these people..."
"There's a HEAVY FOCUS on the Facehuggers and I love it. Looks like they fully understand how creepy the Facehuggers are, and maximised its horror potential."
"I dunno, a whole 2 minutes and not a single android blew another android's flute, is this even an Alien movie?"
"Looks like a rubbish sixth-form drama course imagining, as typified by low quality, unconvincing delivery of ""There's just sumfink in vuh fukin woh-ah"". I think I'll give it a miss. Prometheus and (especially) Covenant, very hard acts to follow."
You can already tell it's woke crap. It's not a continuation of the last two movies. It's just a horror movie with aliens.
"I’m sure that the age of the group that’s in the station will be explained. 
Perhaps the more senior staff had left the station for whatever reason.
Or perhaps they left to watch how the Alien operates and how the crew works to survive and the rest of staff want to see what the guys left behind attempt to do and how the Alien overcomes it.
Basically a science experiment. 

Who knows but I’m fairly certain that there is a reason why the people we see are young and it will be explained."
Lot of DEI boxes checked in that trailer
"Whoever did the Cinematography/ Color Grading deserves a raise, every shot looks like a painting"
I saw this ima YouTube add
looks like it has a great potential to be the worst crap ever made so far
This looks terrible. Im really disappointed.
It's basically Alien for the Gen Z

This trailer already showed us two people that are dying and the main character who obviously wont 🤦‍♂️
HELL YEAHH 🔥🔥
Ridley Scott makes the same movie again
Remember when we all thought it can't get worse than Covenant? We were so young and naive.
This is a remake of old one
Recycling movies
"The Woke version of the Alien Franchise. All young, all races, many girls, etc."
"Wow, so bad :("
"Bag actors, boring faces"
I wanted the sequel to prometheus and covenant
"This is really well shot and the trailer has some really effective sound design choices (alien smashing into ribcage, the high pitched ringing over the slow title reveal). Now I'm just hoping the movie itself lives up to how technically good it looks."
"Ok , I will say it. No one can hear you scream in space."
United Colors of Xenomorph
"My Checklist:
enough lady bosses to make me not interested

So the story of David (Fassbender) never will be finished? Then what was the point of Prometheus and Covenant?
Is it a follow-up to the prometheus films?

"""Running causes accidents. Please let me help you."""

who thought that high pitch for so many seconds was a good idea?
"Yuck in the 70s, yuck now. Can't wait!"
This movie looks really good!
half life....
Crap
&quot;In space no one can hear you ALIEN ROMULUS&quot; you moved in *AWT27X* ?
The best part about these Trailers so far is that Fede Alvarez said in an interview when the Teaser Trailer came out he doesn’t want to show too much of this movie.
Where is siqourey weaver Ripley she was the only one who knew how to kill it.
"Put a diverse woman in it and make it super lame. - my official prediction for this movie, borrowed from Cartman."
Looked promising until i saw the cast.
OK now I want to see it
"Just makes the quality of the original Alien stand out more.

These new movies are sub par... Like the whole industry doesn't remember how to make a good FEELING movie"
"Looks someone woke, which has me worried, but hopefully it's watchable."
"Reading the comments, I can say the worst of Alien movies are their ""fans""."
Meh
The way they used that scary thumping noise to start the trailer and transitioned it to being the chestburster scene was terrifying
Hopefully this is better than the last 2 from Ridley Scott 🙏
"In space, no one can hear you over the deafening jumpscares."
Looks typically boring and derivative.
Looks like another box ticking exercise.  Think i will give it a miss.
We want ellen Ripley 😭
"Disney loves ""Cash Cows"" An Alien Ride at Disneyland is a sure bet. Be tough to fit one on Mickey's face."

You know you’re old when you see the casts are looking like Stranger Things. 😅
is this the real trailer?
The f**k is the wo’ah? 😹
Too much information
Seems Alien franchise degraded to a category B teen horror. :( Not interested anymore.
Boycotting all new alien movies. Enough is enough
Few seconds of seeing these characters and you just want the Alien to kill all of them.
Oh I thought it was a fan made video.  O_O  😵
That portable “XRay Device” is bloody awesome
"For us older Alien fans we just want answers to our questions: Why do the engineers want to destroy Earth, why were there murals of the Xenomoph on the walls in Prometheus, and where did the Alien craft come from that was derelict on LV-426?"
Generation Z versus the alien? OmfGoddess Plzzzzz deliver me!!
Hmm looks exactly like the rest of them

"""Memba Alien?""
""Yeah, I memba!"""
"They ruined the most iconic sci-fi horror movies by turning them into poorly conceived franchises. The original films had unique, compelling stories, but the sequels and spin-offs often feel like cash grabs, lacking the original's creativity and suspense."
There’s something in woa
if the trailer feels like a checklist imagine how the movie feels.
"""theres something in the watah."""
Something in the wo’ a!
Teenagers in space…looks like I’m cheering on the alien
"Kids,kids,JUST kids.🤨😔"
0:14 Alvarez literally foreshadowing with a shadow on a forehead. Brilliant.
"How can it be good? The trailers are full of CGI. But more important, this is not 1986 where we’re seeing a facehugger for the first time and are horrified by it. We’ve been accustomed to it and other horror stuff."
"The British dude: ""There is sumtin' in a wo-ah""
The alien: ""I mostly drink wo-ah, mostly"""
face hugger really did man dirty lol
Children in space
That face hugger was in the mood and he was not who knows *AWT27X* ? This is the smartest thing I came across for a while
I predict it will be painfully adequate
I hopr the storyline and dialogue are a lot better in the rest of the movie...
teen wave meets alien. yea ill pass
"I really, REALLY wanna be optimistic, but I saw Prometheus & half of Covenant. I'll watch it on a streaming service & buy a copy if it's good. Please make me want to buy it."
The fact that they're selling this film just as an Alien soft remake might mean that the film will be big in terms of plot. Soooo loking forward to it.
We need to call in Predator
Face hugger didn’t even buy him a drink
Looks awful.
"Yeah, put a crew of foul mouthed teenagers in space, on some big a$$ space ship and watch things pop out of their chests. Its been done, far better, in the previous films"
"There ya go. That's the whole movie right there. Basically Alien 1, but in 2024."
Glad its in space :)
Looks like Alien is the good guy in this one.
The trailer only made my tinnitus worse
Are you not entertained ???? Not really! ummmm so so
I’m so hyped!! But the original can never be replaced. Hoping it’ll be amazing and intense
"По трейлеру прекрасно видно, что новый фильм продолжит традицию прошлого. А именно максимально бездарные актеры, которые играют конченых дегенератов из дешевых ужастиков. Вспоминаю первые части и даже не верится, что создатель тех фильмов, может сейчас делать такое дерьмище."
1:03 ... there's just somethin' in the f_ _ king wall...? WTF? He can't even articulate W-A-T-E-R correctly?
full movie will in my channel's linked website. (Upload will be super fast).
Fede understood the assignment 🫡
"All we've been asking for is a Prometheus  sequel that would go in depth about the ENGINEERS. Instead, we're getting this generic teenyebopper, space slasher looking movie smh."
The fact that they are using a lot of sets and practical effects rather than full blown over the top cgi is a big plus in my book.
BOOORRIIIINGGGGG GOYSLOP 🥱
The face hugger straight took advantage of that guy.
“Sum-fin’ inna wah-uh!” 😂
"My Mommy always said there were no monsters, no real ones, but there are."

Wow🎉
"I'm going to watch this, and most likely love it BUT...

I'm wondering why USS Sulaco didn't contact the space stations before going through the trouble of going to the surface in Aliens. this is a plot hole that has me thrown off. I would have much rather seen a movie about the colony being sent to the Alien ship, bringing back someone infected, and the entire colony, 60 or 70 families all going to crapper!

I don't know why it SO HARD for Hollywood today to stay on script, there was a perfectly good story to leach off of, and they had to introduce a plot hole for zero reason!"
"If the British dude had his knife, he wouldn’t won that fight in the wooor"
"""In space, nobody can understand your accent."""
"will you brainlets stop getting excited for call backs? ""DUR I REMEMBER THAT FROM THE OTHER MOVIE!"""
This movie looks more like a Stranger Alien Things crossover which I see it heading towards disasterville.
Woke DEI Cast.
How is this connected to Prometheus or covenant. - the entire alien fandom
Another great franchise ruined by CGI and too much gore.
"In space, no one can hear you scream, but apparently everything else is loud AF."
"I've always been more scared of face huggers than the actual aliens themselves, I always have and I always will 💀"
"Are we going to learn anything new in this movie, or is just a special effects upgrade with writing/acting downgrade?"
Hopefully this movie uses the original alien horror formula and doesn’t do more confusing origin stories that don’t really give any real answers.
kinda B trailer huh?
Didn't see one Romulan in the entire trailer.
1:22
"WOKE remake of Alien, looks terrible."
"Two strikes against this rehash of Alien right off the bat:

1. Sigourney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley ain’t in it. 

2. Disney’s producing it.

Number 2 was enough for me to ignore it, but then I saw the trailer.  When a trailer doesn’t hold your interest it’s best to keep your card in your wallet.

That they couldn’t figure out how to put Sigourney Weaver in the cast shows poor planning and even poorer judgment.  I guess they figure youngsters won’t be familiar with the previous Alien movies.

But what the hey, Disney’s done such a bang up job with Star Wars, maybe they’ve applied the same magic formula to Alien: Remus."
Alien 7: Screaming College Interns
"""How many squishy goo sounds do you want in the trailer?""

""Yes."""
"All this crap from ppl who didnt see the movie yet.  I think move will be good .Not like first 3, but still a lot better than Prometheus and Covenant."
Child actors not a good movie
I remember the week of trauma and horror trying to sleep in my bed alone after I watched the First Alien movie when I was like 9 or 10 .... literally was thinking they are everywhere after dark ...
This looks about as fresh and exciting as 3-day old scrambled eggs.
This looks bad. The aliens could fight and terrify  harden marines and professionals. These actors look and seem like a bunch of undergrads of course there all going to get slaughtered by the aliens. Feels like the director wanted to make Halloween film  instead of an alien film.
0:03 For a moment I thought they united the Blade Runner and Alien universes.
Same stuff 🥱 😴.
"Why are they all like, 18? lol"
Some Real CW level acting from that black guy
mais do mesmo?
"That space stations interior looks so good, just like alien isolation."
looks promising
"In space no but on the atmosphere spaceships, yes you can hear each other scream. So really a pointless sentence given the context of the film, unless they expect someone to scream out to earth through space. Lol"
Can't wait ❤
Is it just me or I can hear mechagodizilla roar in the background when the alien screams?
еее
"again same, spaceship, small space, aliens running wild.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
From the trailer it looks like a disappointment haha ‘there is sumfin in the fookin wota’ that’s so cringy and chavy. I think they missed out on the story of the engineers covered in Prometheus which a lot of people was hoping to be included. This might be another flop like  recent jeepers creepers. They need to chill with their woke hype - I think I’ll pass on this.
We are going to need nerds for this timeline..
"reading the comments here makes me wonder if all you people do is complain ... watch the movie .. enjoy it .. if you don't wanna watch it because ""It'S tHe sAmE aS tHe OtHeR ALiEN MoviEs"" then don't. literally nobody cares. just a bunch of complaining crybabies"
"""Are you sure you wanna do this"" was Ridley asked this before starting down this path?"
Among us irl???!!!
C R I N G E
How much longer are they going to milking the franchise?
"My hypothesis for the black character, Andy. He’s the movie’s android (andy, hello) and upon encountering the Xeno, his protocols are remotely overridden by Weyland-Yutani and his new protocol becomes: “insure return of organism for analysis. All other considerations secondary.” I believe that’s what we’re seeing happen at 1:38 ."
Best thing is Alien logo showing up at the end of this trailer :)
bunch of kids in space
Please don’t be a disappointment. Please don’t be a disappointment. Please don’t be a disappointment…..
🎉🎉🎉🎉🤙🤙🤙❤
British guy sounds worse than any CW actor
"Come on Mr. Scott , i know you got it in you, please make it good !"
To many youngsters might not be that exciting needed some actors who worked in aliens movies before would be much better.
"Alien: Alien Again.
We've seen this movie."
It looks like an amalgamation of everything we’ve already seen before. It even features that same iconic shot of the xenomorph face to face with Ripley.
"What exactly does this movie add to the franchise?
Teen horror?"
"Love this cassette culture/futurism aesthetic of the indoor architecture, clearly inspired by the '79 original and Isolation."
Predictably ham-handed diverse cast.
This is a really crunchy spaceship
"All right, they used the original Alien title card fade-in thing, but sped up about 20x. I think that alone speaks volumes to the focus and direction of the movie."
"Romulus, finally a Star Trek and Alien crossover."
So basically another Remake of the remake of the remake
"As far as I can tell from this trailer, they at least nailed the atmosphere and aesthetics.. Unlike Prometheus and Covenant which look nothing like an Alien film."
This looks so f**king good!!!!!👽🩸🤖
This was a less then interesting trailer
Blsht
a sequel to Alien that has a concept remotely similar to Alien? I’m stunned
"So, basically I have been wainting for a teenagers-save-us-all film. There have been none of that ever, I wonder what they are like."
"No imagination, always the same with Alien"
Is this just a teen thriller.   Doesn't seem to be anyone over 19 in this junk of a movie.
so who plays Ripley now?
"Just from the trailer, I can already say this will be crap."
NITR0 approved
WOO!!
All alien films are the best
"That was the most British way of saying ""water"" I've ever heard. 
""There's somefin' inna wa'uh."" 🤣"
In short a ghettoed up Alien sequel.
I don’t like sci-fi movies but the 1:30 part was pretty cool.
"Somehow, someway... in some hopeful time in the future, they do an Alien movie like they did the 2nd, ALIENS."
Catch an exclusive interview with Binance’s CEO to get the scoop on future developments
"Well as long as its not all woke and full of DEI programming, should be good. Im excited."
looks awful.
"another Alien movie, having the exact same plot as all previous Alien movies. Unless they decide to give some more backstory, etc., why are they even wasting their time. The only difference with this from the older movies, it the Aliens probably identify as trans, or some other bullshit, LOL"
Ens sequence had my tennitius buggin xD
"Pbly need to change this narrative since we’re practically neighbors, coexisting and stuff-

Just sayin…."
It already looks disappointing. Don't get your hopes up. They will try and insert some woke bullshit.
Head torches FFS
"In theaters, no one can hear you scream…"
Stoked!! Stoked!!! Stoked!!!
So it's a remake of the first Alien film. What a waste
Well I have the feeling that this alien looks like everything I would expect to see in an Alien movie
Holy crap. That last scene. LOL. I'm down.
hell yeah!
This looks so average
"Why does this just look like a remake of the first Alien film? 

Or have they just hidden the plot well within the trailer?"
Glad we can all watch this together as we mourn what Star Wars has become …..
i can c already its more like alien isolation game than aliens so not great
I only watch Aline movie only for Prometheus franchise
@ :52 is the image of romulus and remus feeding from the she-wolf which is symbolic for the founding of rome
"Knowing Ridley's obsession with evil androids, there has to be at least one. Either a major character or even the aliens."
s'mn in the wo'ah
"Studio: Why does nobody like movies anymore?
Also studio: Ctrl+C Ctrl+V"
"Not sure what I think of this as the guy from after Is in this, looks a little slow 🤔"
"Every movie story is same they are just keep making movies in the name of Francise 
Thats why i dont like most of Hollywood films"
This looks amazing I’m so excited we finally getting another alien movie!!
bro why didnt i hear about a new alien? probably because everyone been talking about deadpool
"Hiya mate, in space no one can hear ya, innit?"
So being a screen writer these days consists of dropping the F bomb in every other sentence?? Is that writing??
"1:37 

Annnd, trailer giving away a major plot point..."
"Oh boy, finally a movie worth watching on the big screen"
"Prometheus : most stupid crew in the history of stupidity.
Covenant crew: hold our beers
Romulus crew: wait and see"
Thank god they brought back the Practical effects!
"Non capisco perché ritornare indietro nei film. Gli ultimi film come prometeus,eccc hanno fatto cagare questo seguira le altre uscite precedenti."
"so sad there is no continuation for prometheus and covenant 😢
would be nice to see the whole david arc"
"„Ahhhhhh..“
Ellen Ripley : just give me a gun and I will finish this tonight"
"I saw Ailen when it first came out. There were no previews or trailers. Only the quote about not hearing a scream in space. I'd taken my girl out for supper, then we smoked a joint before going into the theatre. We felt great and were excited about the movie. By the end of that movie I had a severe headache and an upset stomach. Freaking unforgetable!!"
Os visuais estão maravilhosos 😭🫶
We need a movie about the engineers!
Ive been watching alien sense i was 7 and i fell in love with it.i hope this wont be like covenant
Take the original Alien - make is super diverse - lather rinse repeat. Yawn. Hard pass.
So alien is a teenage horror flick now……
"The ""young people break into a place and end up victims"" plotlines are Fede Alvarez's favorite."
"""Welcome Back, Chopper""?"
"""Sure you wanna do this?"" Oh yea lets fight Aliens one more time!"
I wish this was a crossover movie about a Xenomorph infestation of the Romulan Star Empire.
"It looks like a basic, sci fi jumpscare movie. Like the bad guy could be anything. I don't feel a connection to the storyline, lore or characters."
"Mais do mesmo. Poderia ser uma sequência de Alien: Covenant, mas naaaaoo, inventam mais um filme genérico de alien. Saco cheio, no cinema que não vejo isso."
Yes. It does look like it could be trash.
"Those complaining about the look of this movie are obviously overlooking the fact that the original Alien was made with a very similar atmosphere and tension. The original was a tense, claustrophobic, horror type movie with a space setting. This will be a good movie based on the criteria from the original."
Teenagers in space😂😂😂
W❤
"""In space, no one can hear you sequel"" - the Sequeler"
I'm pretty sure I got tinnitus after watching this trailer.
How many more times must they make this pointless movie??? With all this future tech we somehow always end up stumbling on this dangerous alien species keen on destroying and killing human yet no one ever does anything about it ever. Yeah OKAY
"Teen ""space colonizers"" VS the xenomorph. Can't wait."
Cinemaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"To anyone bitching about the age of the actors - Alvarez stated he wanted to explore what would happen when the colonists of Hadley's Hope (from Aliens - see the deleted scene for reference) grew up, and how they'd react to a mundane, uninspiring environment (therefore looking for an opportunity to get out) - they haven't done it to 'go woke', to deliberately appeal to a younger audience, for 'diversity' or any number of cheap excuses people are using to discredit it before its even out. The reasoning is fully grounded in the established lore of the series."
"The MOST, British way to say ""water""  lol"
"""have i ever told you the definition of insanity?"""
1:06 Bro got violated💀
"Finally finally! A movie where the writers put in something that will become a part of cinema lexicon. Although I'm not sure how to spell ""wo ah."" 😅"
"I’m looking forward to this. And no I do not care that the cast are younger, or that there’s only a couple of white dudes, or that the British guy pronounces water like “wo’ah”. The practical and visual effects are going to be awesome. Come at me incel bros 👍"
Wow looks terrible
Meh...
"kind of a lame trailer.   does it have no story line?  just replaced with young, unknown actors and same old same old.   Prometheus was awesome. Hope this one is that good?"
"So this is more or less ""Alien but what if it was a cheesy teens/early 20s horror"". Looks like it's gonna blow"
Man i really wish they would have picked up off covenant
We have Alien at home.
"I mean ok but why can't we in 2024 have a low-key, expertly acted masterpiece like they did in 1979? This is looking like boilerplate horror."
What is this Alien Grange hill edition? Who threw the sausage?
Thank god we are doing it proper
Kind of feels like I have seen this already.
"I lost it at ""woo 'ahh""."
Can’t wait to watch.
That face hugger did NOT ask for consent.
"We had aliens vs marines,pirates, scientists, couples. 
Now we have aliens vs kids. 
Can’t wait 😂"
So is Michael Fassbender no longer canon now?
Ummmmmm why is everyone like 21 years old …. ??? 
cool. racemixing like 11 seconds in.  much propaganda wow
Ending one survivor landing on earth and the alien is in side her PT 2 the take over of earth
An Alien movie is only as good as its human characters.
Alien destroy our lives and humans
They's somethin' in the fookin' wo'er!
Ruined like star wars.
Looks promising
"So far it looks like it gonna be a good, old style Aliens with GPU upgrade"
"""In space, no one can hear you scream""
They still have that tagline?"
"We were expecting it to be connected to Prometheus’s engineer story. However, it turned out to be the same old alien horror. I'm tired of seeing the old product in a new package."
so bad
I’ll watch it but it just looks like isolation with some more characters lol
"I'm still wishing for the ""real"" Prometheus sequel"
theres summink inna wo ah innit
"You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.

I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.

~Ash 1979~"
Woke:Romulus
"great, another trailer that gives away 60% of the movie. Amazing work century studios."
alien isolation 2 graphic looks crazy
Looks crappy
The first trailers looked dumb this makes the movie a bit more exciting
so dumb
"""Sigh, please don't be sh1t"" - The entire Aliens franchise fandom"
"1:02 “it’s in the water” 
“What do you mean there’s something in the water…wait, can you say ‘bottle of water’ for me please?”"
the face hugger didn’t need to do all that😭😭😭
This looks promising indeed. I hope they don`t have destroyed it with to much blood.
Jesus that face hugger just violated that man
Look boring for alien movie
One thing about the old movies is that they were actually scary and this one looks as claustrophobic as the first one
"Dear Lord, save us from mockney accents. ""ver war-ah, in me-or-ah, dan tace lie, wot it or-ah! (anybody English and a certain age will remember the advert) 😊"
Rinse cycle on repeat I see same plot no new ideas 😂. Movie industry is laughable rn
Lots of DEI red flags here
"Oh, a ton of acidic blood floating about in zero-g sounds like a total nightmare."
so f*ckin epic :'(((( this sound.... +100 iz 100
"Alien, but this time against high school students."
I will not spend my money on this. Casting a bunch of 12-17 year olds is loosing me on this one.
"Only luck that they evolved into facehuggers, it would be far more scary if they chose the other end :D"
1:38 was his eyes supposed to turn white? can clearly see his pupils
Fox don't give up. Alien 9?
"Oh wow, they're wheeling out Alien again to make some more money..."
All these alien movies have the same storyline .ughhh it’s annoying now
"When I was in the cinemas, when the trailers were playing, when I saw the chestbuster scene, I felt like I was gonna puke, it’s such a gnarly scene that I can’t wait to watch when it comes out"
“In space no one can hear you scream”-Ridley Scott alien 1979
Looks like a children's movie.
Why are all the actors 13 years old?
"Remakes and redo's from Hollywood. Sad, sad, sad. The writers/producers have no more creativity or originality left?"
Wo'ah you doin in the fookin wo'ah
"Thousands of years in the future, highly trained interplanetary workers who grew up on space stations will still have British working class accents"
So many spoilers  in this young people alien trailer
"Woke Teenagers in Space 😂 This is embarrassing now. Leave the old 80s and 90s movies alone. You arent as good as they were at making movies, not even close."
None of these remakes will ever be as good as the MAJESTIC  Sigourney Weaver ones...
Youre telling me that guy with a such thick british accent doesnt carry a knife?
Повесточка цветёт и пахнет (((
(0:43) Huh. You’d think they’d have an all-seeing light equipment like that from the beginning? Makes it easy to see if you’ve got a chest burster on you.
People who came from tik tok only can like this comment 👇
A bunch of kids? I expected it to be an adult film. We'll see if it's any good.
looks meh
Sumfn in the wo-er
"Looks fantastic, but I regret watching this trailer honestly. I feel like it showed off wayyy too much."
Alien/Aliens/Prometheus were the only moves worth a crap.. This one won't be good either most likely
We live in the 25th century and people still speak with a Cockney accent
1:47 Floating in to the Alien acid blood is too cool
Oh a teen horror movie😂
Прометей поставил точку.
This looks like a high school train wreck
Classic circular door opening is a throwback to 1979.
Hmmm...Well.Don't know.Maybe.Waiting for watching
I didn't expect to find some of the best comedy on the internet in a comments section for an Aliens movie trailer.
Idc what you guys say but They definitely doing better than fast and furious franchise
"""There is something in waer"" /_-"
There’s a lot of fan service in this trailer.
I hope this is good so we may get more like this. Miss these types of movies and this particular franchise.
"These actors are way too young for these roles. They look like children, lol."
Hard pass.......where is David in this movie?????
Can't say it looks that good honestly. Looks like Aliens may have gone the woke route.💩
"Was hoping, sigourney weaver, lance Hendrickson, wyonna Ryder, ron pearlman return. Hopefully this aliens movie doesn't bring a disappointment.. I watch from the beginning the first alien. Sigourney weaver and Tom skerrit."
"It looks like they're trying to make a Gen-Z teenage horror movie, but in the Alien Universe. Bring the grown-ups back!"
We want Sigourney Weaver 🧑🪳🪳🪳
"Alien chain
👽🛸"
What is this??? Alien Tik tokkers colonial marines?
"Baby Alien: ""Hey dude, U dont know how to spell ""water"". Come here, let me help you"""
"I just had this reccommended by YT, and i am very confused 😂😅😅"
"I wanted to know how the story of david ended, couldn't care less about a bunch of zoomers dying in space"
"So, what about the Engineers??"
"Alien..... destroyer of an ancient interstellar empire... easy beat by anything wearing white ""Panties"" Eeeew.😂😂😂😂😂"
Jedi vs Aliens would be a sick movie
Nobody talking about the dude givin the facehugger the *Gawk-Gawk 5000* ? Mkay
1:30 to 1:50 is one of the coolest sequences in a trailer ive ever seen without telling too much of whats going on; and yet people are whining for some reason in the comments
I can’t wait for “Prometheus: Remus”
"Some kind of Alien Romulus man *AWT27X* is the best thing you said, love it"
You can just BET that another Predator movie is going to come out soon after this because Alien and Predator always go hand in hand.
we get another alien movie before gta 6
What is this??? Alien Tik tok colonial marines?
To Many tokens. Looks like woke crap.
in space no one can hear you demand your money back
Maybe... the best film in the franchise since ALIEN!
its so weird they do that in colo
Idk why I thought that was jlaw
Cmon man we wanted to know more about The Engineers and that Ship Jockey race not another chest buster movie with no story
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Same 'ol story.
"Only Alien and Aliens were great films. Rest of them were just utter trash. 
And that old fart boomer completely ruined his own film with Prometheus film anyway.
If you gonna make a good Alien film, the main character should be a European man. Because that would be a good start and gives a radical kick against the official ideology."
Tired of woke hollywood
"Same ol s**t, nothing new."
Lame
What a diverse cast! They even have a Alien!
I'd like aliens marine movie 2 is probably my favorite out of the series
"No Sigourney, not watching."
"Just like the 70s alien 👽👾,no one can hear 🙉 u in space 🌌🚀"
"Fede Alvarez really likes his ""young people break into a place and end up victims"" plotlines."
"I see nothing new here... just different faces, different places... otherwise, S.O.S. ... this well is long ago dried up...I'll pass..."
Its all fun and games until Isaac shows up with his plasma cutter.
"0:44 Okay, that's pretty terrifying. Seeing the alien break out of the chest is already a haunting image but seeing it in action is both disgusting and horrifying."
"Jesus, Spike Fearn really took the classic bo'oh 'o' wa'er meme to a whole new level lol."
"A typical lazy FRANCHISE rehash and cash grab, these franchises are going down the shitter like yesterdays curry, no my money so i couldn't care less....''scream teens in space'', please!"
"20th Century Studios: _""Your tinnitus is not trailer-related""_"
"Love what they did with the ""In space, No One can Hear you Scream"" 1:31"
Where's David?
"For those saying that actors look like they're highschool students, please check their ages on google before acting braindead"
Mfs really be watching a trailer and deciding the quality of the movie like they’ve seen it 10 times
That lady in Aliens that said &quot;kill me&quot; this is her origin. making a move on *AWT27X* was great! Thanks for the headsup
welp since Disney owns 20th century fox i will reserve judgement till i see it for myself but i dont have hope
"Kids eh? In the original Alien, the crew looked like space truckers. These lot look like they just finished School."
I want to know which one of these characters is going to give us a flute solo!
"Another DEI failure. Bring back the real series, not this politically correct crap."
"So Alien is a teen scream Horror now, no thanks."
The most terrifying thing in this trailer is the fact that Hollywood can’t stop making movies centered around incredibly annoying stereotypical young adults making mind-numbingly stupid decisions only to further the movie universe.
Why not a sequel to Alien: covenant??? 😥😥😭😭😭😭😡
"If Ridley Scott is involved on this, I can trust a bit there's something decent on this film."
"Alien is a perfect villain.. no speeches, just action and fear"
No Ripley WTF
0:47 that xray scene is quite cool.
So sad that the story is not about david from prometheus Nd alien covenant..and their journey towards origae-6
"I am very happy because I have come to understand English films without subtitles...a wonderful language, but that was after a lot of effort."
"I am sick and tired of ""strong women"" in movies. Bring back the MEN."
&quot;Alien Films are Tight!&quot; could be all much improved with *AWT27X* and guys being part of it
"you know a monster/horror series has gone on for too long, when you feel like you're starting to root for the monster"
"Love the way the writing ""ALIEN"" appears on screen in silence while flashing between scenes! Genuinely feels different and refreshing as opposed to that recycled style DUN DUN DUN slamming door sound or whatever hahaaha"
"""In space, nobody can hear you scream. But hell... feel free to go loud anyway..."""
Honestly the trailer wasn't that great. I really hope the movie don't disappoint
How can you call this movie woke because what you all saw 1 asian and 1 black character ? Beside the director said that the cast will be like 20-25 year olds and they wont be seasoned scientists but a inexperienced colonisers. So do some research on this movie before commenting
"Ok, what's new? It seems the story is always the same."
"It's the face hugger, innit?"
yeah lets do it
I thought we were going to continue with David the brobot :(
Teenager movie?
"""There's somfin in the fohkin' wo'ah"""
"In space, nobody is over the age of 25"
"1:07 that part looks like hentai 🤦
Off to a great start"
What? Now teenyboppers starring?
Yay another non original franchise movie 😅
"After the successful release of Aliens in 1986, this franchise should have called it quits!"
Finally we are going to see a movie with the horrific atmosphere of the original Space Balls!
Is it already out
"Half the movie is already spoiled with this trailer. Whats the point to see this?

Also looks like generic modern hollywood blockbuster horror film."
i bet this will bomb in the box office
Seems like all these new movies want to just cast kids in roles you would expect to be older. I remember watching the first Alien movie when I was a boy and the cast ages ranged from the 30s to 50s which to me made perfect sence. This one looks like they are all under the age of 25. there might be one or two slightly older but none over the age of 30. Just dont get why they cant cast a more diverse age group. Thats another thing I loved about the original. They looked like average folks. These look like they are showing up for modeling classes.
Who got a bunch of teenagers on a space station? Seems weird
Where is Sigourney?
"Is this more DEI woke crap, or can I finally get excited about a movie again?"
Trash
Looks crap.
The interesting about this is the facehuggers will play into the horror aspect as well
The closeup shot of the facehugger shoving its trach tube down the victim's throat is the stuff of nightmares.
"Movie with teen ?
Most of the time the movie is bad ."
"The Batman:  
 🎵🎶 Something In The Way

Alien Romulus:  
Something in the W O H ' A H"
alien isolation vibe i love it
where is ellen ripley aka sigourney alien hunter
"I can smell the wokeness in this movie, also dont they know that most of the people who grew up watching the originals are boomers, gen x and millennials? what's with all the children playing all the roles in the movie?"
"Same script, different actors."
The practical Xenomorph looks way scarier than anything CGI can conjure up
Isso aqui tá fantástico!!
Could have gone without the ringing at the end
"Turn on captions, and it gives you all the character names. 
Beware, though, because it has spoiled endings to movies (""No Exit"" didn't need to watch as captions gave kidnapper/killer away)"
1:07 bro getting violated.
"""Something in the wota"" 

Of course she didn't understood 😅"
i dont get how everyones always so clean shaven even in space
Will we ever know what happenned with the engeeners ? I'm really over with the xenomorphs...
"Mans said ""ts summ'n Indah wa'ah'😂"
Some of ya'll in the comments want this movie to fail and it shows.
"There's something about the practical effects with no cgi and good actors that will always be superior to these modern, over polished movies. I don't care if it costs a billion dollars. Watch how much of a letdown the inevitable chest bursting scene will be in this compared to the original."
Stomp 🦶 trailers are the worst 😅
"Meh, probably wont be that good"
"Looks good, finally a film maker with some balls. I don't know how many more kid friendly spin offs I can take lol. 😆"
can they not think of new stories to tell in this universe?  feels like ive already seen this movie and its not even out yet
"“Ther’s sumfinn in the foak’n woah’ah!”

…It’s pronounced “There’s something in the fuckin’ water!”"
i can see plot armour!!!
It somehow looked weird when the Facehugger inserted his tentacles into the mouth of the victim. Or is it just my messed up imagination? 😀
"David - "" oh these crazy kids and their shenanigans 😊 """
"The Black guy who says ""Run,"" is definitely the android in this."
What can I say. The idea is disappointing.
The actors look so lame and forgetable
Nothing fresh or creative about it!
"I think i would have preferred a third and final movie in the ""David Saga"" rather than another Alien on a ship movie, but im still optimistic"
I'm going to watch it for Free... like always
"Me: starts watching Alien Romulus trailer

Also me: begins to have world war 2 flashbacks of Alien isolation"
"I've seen this before... and I'll watch it again, for better or for worse."
This looks great. and using some British actors gives it a much more real and gritty feel.
"Brit: ""The's sumfn in that wotah!""
Facehugger: Wotcher, guvnah. What's the craic?"
interesting... young cast but the story look like... it's an ALIEN movie :-)
"Not what i was expecting (story follow up) looks quite generic, it seems that the formula is getting really old… i feel the boredom out of this, also, they are givin hints: “in SPACE, no one can hear you SCREAM” Scream movie formula in Space :/"
These characters make it feel like some summer camp slasher movie
Rated R.
In space nothing can trigger your gag reflex
Prometheus was cool and alien covenant was ok but this seems like the same alien /aliens /aliens /3 and aliens resurrection just repackaged……..prolly a 💩 movie
Can’t see diddley squat too dark but I can say that this is a guaranteed turkey
The Facehugger attacks look to be wicked af  🙏
"Look, a teenage angst Alien movie. They sure know what people want."
"Only thing for certain, final girl gonna be light skinned"
"Must say, after all the VS,  remake, prequel, and others. This one looks actuall promising.  🙏🏻please be good"
А зачем они на главную роль выбрали маленькую девочку?
"Well, this seems to be the actual movie and not a ""concept""..."
Lets remake the same movie for the 3rd time .... ok man .
"""Ther's su'thin in'e wa'er"" - random british guy"
"I'm currently playing ""Aliens: Dark Descent"" and got so in the mood for a new alien movie."
"please i need to remaster the old sequel, VE FORGOTTEN THE nAME,  Any body? Help me with he previous sequels from 2000 to 2007"
"They're really throwing it back a bit with the old ship settings, the claustrophobic, closed-in scenes... This is almost a breath of fresh air!"
"I had to rewatch this trailer just now. Didn’t see any zoomer broccoli, so maybe this film still has potential."
From 1978 they have been making alien movies with the same concept every time...just like Terminator they never changed 😢😢
"Ooooo, this will be so heavily scutinized by all of us who love the original. Sigourney has HUGE boots to fill. Please be good. Please be good. Please be good."
Haven't you movie people ever heard of Tinnitus???? OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not watching this movie based on that alone. Dam that hurt!
‘Hold still — open your mouth!’ - Facehugger
"Prometheus - cool, engineers intrigue me! This will progress the storyline!
Covenant - didn’t really have engineers in it but I liked it, may open the door for more plot stuff.
Romulus - carbon copy of every single Aliens movie, just a different setting."
looks like fan made trash
"Well its about bloody time someone made an actual alien movie. No white, bold giants this time please."
I'm the N.East of England. That guy's accent is *really* forkin annoying :D
british accent ruins it for me.
who else misses the Amanda Ripley. who knows *AWT27X* ? This is the most amazing thing I came across for a while
"Facehugger trying to put its thingy in guys mouth without his consent , LGBTQ plus people are going to love this movie ."
"ok another thing hollywood doesnt or does think about when releasing you have a mostly teenage cast getting oviposited down their throats and they seem to be going really in depth with
those scenes now looks like anothe cuties incident."
"""In space no one can understand your thick british accent"""
"The facehugger is like "" it's WATER not WATA"""
This is gonna be the worst Star Trek movie ever! The Romulans didn't even look like Romulans! I'm skipping this one just like J.J. Abrams trilogy.
there's something in the wo'-er 🤣
"No sorry this just not cut the mustard, its just wrong, and kid actors, No."
Face hugger didn't even buy him a drink
"Oh, boy.  Same Old, Same Old."
"I wanna hear...just one last time in my life vasquez scream ""lets rock!!!"""
lol from instagram
"A crew of Gen Z'ers vs the Xenomorphs;
I'm in.
Popcorn, please."
"Ahh, an inter-racial couple in their 20's, getting in trouble in space.... AHH ahhh so cute, so Netflix. 




























































(the 'Alien' story had died, long ago, on a distant planet, called Fury 161)




."
Do movie producers MUST put black actors in movies?
"I'll wait until the reviews are out and as long as there is no ""Agenda"" ""Message"" being pushed I'll probably go see this :)"
So they did a remake...
"Don't forget: ""There's something in the Woha"""
I have a bad feeling about this
In Fede we trust
Are we allowed to hype? Because I am starting it...
Am I going to go and see this?   :0/
It looks like Alien Isolation. DOPE
Alien3
"Already saw this 45 years ago, when I was 10"
Anyone who sees my comment will be successful and healthier.May God bless you abundantly🙏
"Okay let's go, watching this😢"
Alien films have been getting progressively worse since Alien 3. They've made more bad films than good at this stage.
Ohh the sound of the motion tracker ❤
RATED PG-13 :=)
18 years old kids are being let to go with billions of dolars equipment in a planetary mission to find alien life form
Aaaaaa
"looks like a fan fic to me,might be ok for a TV movie"
Looks exactly like the same movie but with worse actors 😂 pass
BORING 🙂
Is this continuing from alien covalent?
Alien: British teenagers in a well-lit spaceship being clumsy and terrified without any suspense
There's something in the woah😅
Variedades de vídeos 👏👏
Wish they would have just made a sequel to Prometheus.
Yes
"So they are going to release a new Alien movie with the same storyline, same plot as the first Alien movie every 3 years. Got it."
I love event horizon!
😮😮😮😮
"“In space, the majority of people can’t hear you scream.”"
"So it's just a repeat of Alien 1?
I'd rather see Ridley Scott's prometheus series play out."
How does this movie fit into the Alien saga?
Are you trying to say “water💦🇬🇧”? 😂😂😂🤣
"Kinda disappointed that this film didn’t end up being a sequel/take place after Alien Resurrection. Instead it’ll be taking place between Alien & Aliens.. whole new cast, spin-off, but still somehow connected to the main storyline"
Hopefully these actors are good and not destroying the legacy.  Covenant lacked good acting and so did Prometheus. A L I E N was a top list of brilliant people all around
I hope half the movie is a tinnitus simulation.
"So many spoilers in the trailer jez, Are that the best moments of the movie? lol
I'm sorry for my negativity, but my trust in big movie studios are so low. I havent  seen a good AAA movie in a while. It is just over the top action and SG with a crappy story that doesn't make any sense. I wish they focused  more on the story and less action. Don't get me wrong, A good action scene can be real good if it is done right.

Il stop rambling now. Let's hope this movie is good."
They all look like kids
Time to replay alien isolation
"This movie is missing a cat. bro *AWT27X* is the best thing you said, well done"
No adults were harmed in the making of this movie.
Hope this doesn't turn into another F A L I E N
More CGI bunk.
Could really use a yautja or two right now...
The Goonies X Aliens.......... 💩💀
That facehugger didn't even buy the man dinner
"Let's try our best to be content. Fortunately, the classic milestone will always be there. Let's take a breath"
Will it lose more money than Furiosa or Gladiator 2?
they really could improve the story telling in alien movies... the actual lore is so much deeper and interesting than cheap jumpscares :/
LOOKS CRAP!!!!!!
I love how they've taken designs from alien isolation as well as the original
Is this Alien covenant next part?
1:06 that's kinda hot- 👽😳
"I can't believe they really made an english man say ""water"" in a tense scene"
"This is one of maybe 5 movies that I have really looked forward to seeing in the last 20 years. Fede cut this and the teaser himself and it shows. I love the sound design! I don't know why, but I loved the littlest things like the deep guitar strum when the xeno is introduced and I loved the crackling sound of the spaceship approaching the space station at the very start of the first teaser. I really hope this is an example for studios to get directors that actually care about the IP and let them do their job without interfering. The main thing studios should push for is practical effects done right over doing cgi for everything. The biggest reason the cost of films these days are so insane is from too much cgi when it's so much more expensive and looks worse than doing practical sprinkled with cgi. You get better acting from all the actors when everything isn't a green screen too. And all the set designs are absolutely stunning! I would have paid anything to walk through them..."
"The trailers are not what they used to be. They always left you wonder and excited but now they give you the whole story in one trailer, thats why i don't watch them"
1:07 That facehugger is going to get this movie an X rating.
Getting major Alien: Isolation vibes. It seems like the people who made this are genuine Alien fans. We need a good Alien movie.
so they remade ALIEN with DEI ?  What is original or adds to the story?
This movie is already ruined usually movies with kids in it aren't that good.
omg this is so the alien isolation game
They've totally ripped off the Alien series
"Humans : Please call backup


Le Predator: Eliminate all life forms"
"In space, no one can hear you:
""There's somefin' inna wa'uh."""
I don't see no marine action
Alien franchise is getting draggy
OMG YOU CAN TELL HOW MANY PRACTICAL EFFECTS THERE ARE!!!!
For almost 50 years all the humans did to fight the Aliens was to keep sending small private teams to investigate.
Call the predator
It just looks lame 😔Aliens: Tinnitus. Alins: Fumfings in'd Wtah kills incompetent people. Alina Romulus: The YA Movie.
Y’all remember in *Aliens* when the tracker was going off and the Xenomorphs were above the ceiling? Scarred me for life.
"1:16 Is it just me or does him saying, ""run"" call back to that vine meme song by Awolnation?"
Kinda looks like some woke garbage already - sad i can already tell its going to be trash
"Every Alien movie, ever....
Person 1: I don't think we should go into <insert creepy location here>!!!
Person 2: Will be fine.
Face Hugger: *hello*"
I remember when this happened
"If the trailer didn't make it seem like this movie will be another unoriginal cliché Alien, the ""in space no one can hear you scream"" line should really drive home the point."
Mês que vem! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Poster Alien Kraken...
"Miscegenation on the first three seconds of the trailer.
You won't get my money"
โรมูรัน
slop
another dark unlit move where you can't see a thing in daylight
not finishing the Michael fasbender trilogy with David the android is criminal activity
Looks like a reboot for genz.
"1:48 Well that's a new nope. Acid blood suspended in zero gravity while you're floating helplessly through it? Yea, that's a nope."
In space…no one heats your cream. should know *AWT27X* is in its prime
Alien: TikTok
"The Alien Xenomorph, my beloved and beautiful creature. How I wish to see the humans give birth to your glory."
"There's something in the wa'er
What do you mean?
He means WATER love but like that plane'arium fella from South Park he can't pronounce the letter T"
woke garbage
"This unprepared, untrained and inexperienced group of friends seem to last longer and better than the people did in the first two Alien movies."
"Looks good.   HATE the timpani drums though, any sound designer worth their salt doesn’t use those in a trailer anymore."
"Well, i'm surprised it actually look like an Alien movie. A good one."
"Can already tell they’ve co-opted the franchise to spread “the message,” which is so phenomenally stupid given the original. 

Ah, well."
00:45 worst case of heartburn ive ever seen
I was hoping that one of the newer movies would give Alien Isolation Vibes!
Hyper hyped fr fr. Huge Alien fan from the beginning!
Why does this trailer look fan made??
"Another box office disaster coming.
😅😅😅"
"1:05 Facehugger: ""Its water! Not wo'a!"""
"“Oi mate, listen, I fink there’s  an alien on this ship I do”"
fome
"Aliens: ""they mostly come out at night... mostly.""
Alien Romulus: ""there's sumfin' in the fa-in' wo-ah!"""
Another Fem-disaster movie.... my gosh.
Those aggressive face huggers are low-key terrifying
"As we feared, this is for a ""modern audience"". It's sad that this will get ripped apart. No wonder James Cameron refused to make another film."
DEI is strong with this film 😒
1:52
DEI movie
"British Guy: There’s something in the wa’er!
American Girl: OMG! Your accent is so hot!
British Guy: There’s something in the wa’er!!
American Girl: Stop it! So sexy!!
British Guy: 1:00"
i was hoping it lined up with the last two movies
